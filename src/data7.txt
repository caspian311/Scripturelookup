Mark|4|30|And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?
Mark|4|31|It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,
Mark|4|32|yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.
Mark|4|33|And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;
Mark|4|34|and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
Mark|4|35|And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.
Mark|4|36|And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.
Mark|4|37|And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.
Mark|4|38|And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark|4|39|And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark|4|40|And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?
Mark|4|41|And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
Mark|5|1|And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
Mark|5|2|And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark|5|3|who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;
Mark|5|4|because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.
Mark|5|5|And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
Mark|5|6|And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;
Mark|5|7|and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.
Mark|5|8|For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.
Mark|5|9|And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.
Mark|5|10|And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark|5|11|Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark|5|12|And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark|5|13|And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, {in number} about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.
Mark|5|14|And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.
Mark|5|15|And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, {even} him that had the legion: and they were afraid.
Mark|5|16|And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.
Mark|5|17|And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
Mark|5|18|And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.
Mark|5|19|And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and {how} he had mercy on thee.
Mark|5|20|And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.
Mark|5|21|And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.
Mark|5|22|And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,
Mark|5|23|and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: {I pray thee}, that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.
Mark|5|24|And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.
Mark|5|25|And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark|5|26|and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
Mark|5|27|having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.
Mark|5|28|For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.
Mark|5|29|And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.
Mark|5|30|And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power {proceeding} from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?
Mark|5|31|And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Mark|5|32|And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark|5|33|But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
Mark|5|34|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Mark|5|35|While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s {house} saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?
Mark|5|36|But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
Mark|5|37|And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark|5|38|And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and {many} weeping and wailing greatly.
Mark|5|39|And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.
Mark|5|40|And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.
Mark|5|41|And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.
Mark|5|42|And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.
Mark|5|43|And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that {something} should be given her to eat.
Mark|6|1|And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
Mark|6|2|And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and {what mean} such mighty works wrought by his hands?
Mark|6|3|Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.
Mark|6|4|And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
Mark|6|5|And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
Mark|6|6|And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.
Mark|6|7|And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
Mark|6|8|and he charged them that they should take nothing for {their} journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;
Mark|6|9|but {to go} shod with sandals: and, {said he}, put not on two coats.
Mark|6|10|And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.
Mark|6|11|And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.
Mark|6|12|And they went out, and preached that {men} should repent.
Mark|6|13|And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
Mark|6|14|And king Herod heard {thereof}; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.
Mark|6|15|But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, {It is} a prophet, {even} as one of the prophets.
Mark|6|16|But Herod, when he heard {thereof}, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.
Mark|6|17|For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.
Mark|6|18|For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
Mark|6|19|And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;
Mark|6|20|for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.
Mark|6|21|And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;
Mark|6|22|and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
Mark|6|23|And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
Mark|6|24|And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.
Mark|6|25|And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Mark|6|26|And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.
Mark|6|27|And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark|6|28|and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
Mark|6|29|And when his disciples heard {thereof}, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
Mark|6|30|And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.
Mark|6|31|And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
Mark|6|32|And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.
Mark|6|33|And {the people} saw them going, and many knew {them}, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.
Mark|6|34|And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
Mark|6|35|And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;
Mark|6|36|send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.
Mark|6|37|But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark|6|38|And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go {and} see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
Mark|6|39|And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark|6|40|And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark|6|41|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
Mark|6|42|And they all ate, and were filled.
Mark|6|43|And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.
Mark|6|44|And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark|6|45|And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before {him} unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.
Mark|6|46|And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
Mark|6|47|And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
Mark|6|48|And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:
Mark|6|49|but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
Mark|6|50|for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
Mark|6|51|And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;
Mark|6|52|for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
Mark|6|53|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
Mark|6|54|And when they were come out of the boat, straightway {the people} knew him,
Mark|6|55|and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
Mark|6|56|And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
Mark|7|1|And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
Mark|7|2|and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.
Mark|7|3|(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;
Mark|7|4|and {when they come} from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)
Mark|7|5|And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?
Mark|7|6|And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,             This people honoreth me with their lips,                   But their heart is far from me.
Mark|7|7|But in vain do they worship me,                   Teaching {as their} doctrines the precepts of men.
Mark|7|8|Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.
Mark|7|9|And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.
Mark|7|10|For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:
Mark|7|11|but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given {to God};
Mark|7|12|ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;
Mark|7|13|making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
Mark|7|14|And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:
Mark|7|15|there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
Mark|7|16|{If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.}
Mark|7|17|And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
Mark|7|18|And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, {it} cannot defile him;
Mark|7|19|because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? {This he said}, making all meats clean.
Mark|7|20|And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.
Mark|7|21|For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
Mark|7|22|covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:
Mark|7|23|all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
Mark|7|24|And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.
Mark|7|25|But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
Mark|7|26|Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
Mark|7|27|And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Mark|7|28|But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
Mark|7|29|And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
Mark|7|30|And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
Mark|7|31|And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
Mark|7|32|And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.
Mark|7|33|And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;
Mark|7|34|and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
Mark|7|35|And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
Mark|7|36|And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.
Mark|7|37|And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
Mark|8|1|In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Mark|8|2|I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:
Mark|8|3|and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.
Mark|8|4|And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?
Mark|8|5|And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
Mark|8|6|And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
Mark|8|7|And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.
Mark|8|8|And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.
Mark|8|9|And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark|8|10|And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark|8|11|And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.
Mark|8|12|And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
Mark|8|13|And he left them, and again entering into {the boat} departed to the other side.
Mark|8|14|And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.
Mark|8|15|And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
Mark|8|16|And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.
Mark|8|17|And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?
Mark|8|18|Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
Mark|8|19|When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
Mark|8|20|And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.
Mark|8|21|And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?
Mark|8|22|And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.
Mark|8|23|And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?
Mark|8|24|And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold {them} as trees, walking.
Mark|8|25|Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.
Mark|8|26|And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
Mark|8|27|And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?
Mark|8|28|And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.
Mark|8|29|And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
Mark|8|30|And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark|8|31|And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark|8|32|And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark|8|33|But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Mark|8|34|And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark|8|35|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.
Mark|8|36|For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
Mark|8|37|For what should a man give in exchange for his life?
Mark|8|38|For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Mark|9|1|And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There are some here of them that stand {by}, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.
Mark|9|2|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them;
Mark|9|3|and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
Mark|9|4|And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark|9|5|And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Mark|9|6|For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.
Mark|9|7|And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye him.
Mark|9|8|And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
Mark|9|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead.
Mark|9|10|And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.
Mark|9|11|And they asked him, saying, {How is it} that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
Mark|9|12|And he said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought?
Mark|9|13|But I say unto you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him.
Mark|9|14|And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
Mark|9|15|And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
Mark|9|16|And he asked them, What question ye with them?
Mark|9|17|And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;
Mark|9|18|and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.
Mark|9|19|And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me.
Mark|9|20|And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Mark|9|21|And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child.
Mark|9|22|And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark|9|23|And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.
Mark|9|24|Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
Mark|9|25|And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
Mark|9|26|And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and {the boy} became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.
Mark|9|27|But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
Mark|9|28|And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, {How is it} that we could not cast it out?
Mark|9|29|And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.
Mark|9|30|And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
Mark|9|31|For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|9|32|But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark|9|33|And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?
Mark|9|34|But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who {was} the greatest.
Mark|9|35|And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark|9|36|And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,
Mark|9|37|Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
Mark|9|38|John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.
Mark|9|39|But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
Mark|9|40|For he that is not against us is for us.
Mark|9|41|For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Mark|9|42|And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
Mark|9|43|And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
Mark|9|44|{where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.}
Mark|9|45|And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.
Mark|9|46|{where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.}
Mark|9|47|And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;
Mark|9|48|where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark|9|49|For every one shall be salted with fire.
Mark|9|50|Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
Mark|10|1|And he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of Judaea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
Mark|10|2|And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away {his} wife? trying him.
Mark|10|3|And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark|10|4|And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
Mark|10|5|But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
Mark|10|6|But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them.
Mark|10|7|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
Mark|10|8|and the two shall become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
Mark|10|9|What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark|10|10|And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.
Mark|10|11|And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:
Mark|10|12|and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.
Mark|10|13|And they were bringing unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.
Mark|10|14|But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|15|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
Mark|10|16|And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
Mark|10|17|And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark|10|18|And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, {even} God.
Mark|10|19|Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and mother.
Mark|10|20|And he said unto him, Teacher, all these things have I observed from my youth.
Mark|10|21|And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Mark|10|22|But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.
Mark|10|23|And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|24|And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|25|It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|26|And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?
Mark|10|27|Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
Mark|10|28|Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
Mark|10|29|Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,
Mark|10|30|but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
Mark|10|31|But many {that are} first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark|10|32|And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,
Mark|10|33|{saying}, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:
Mark|10|34|and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|10|35|And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.
Mark|10|36|And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark|10|37|And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on {thy} left hand, in thy glory.
Mark|10|38|But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Mark|10|39|And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
Mark|10|40|but to sit on my right hand or on {my} left hand is not mine to give; but {it is for them} for whom it hath been prepared.
Mark|10|41|And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.
Mark|10|42|And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Mark|10|43|But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;
Mark|10|44|and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.
Mark|10|45|For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mark|10|46|And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.
Mark|10|47|And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|48|And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|49|And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.
Mark|10|50|And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
Mark|10|51|And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
Mark|10|52|And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.
Mark|11|1|And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,
Mark|11|2|and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.
Mark|11|3|And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.
Mark|11|4|And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.
Mark|11|5|And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
Mark|11|6|And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.
Mark|11|7|And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.
Mark|11|8|And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.
Mark|11|9|And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark|11|10|Blessed {is} the kingdom that cometh, {the kingdom} of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.
Mark|11|11|And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
Mark|11|12|And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.
Mark|11|13|And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
Mark|11|14|And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.
Mark|11|15|And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Mark|11|16|and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.
Mark|11|17|And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.
Mark|11|18|And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
Mark|11|19|And every evening he went forth out of the city.
Mark|11|20|And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
Mark|11|21|And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
Mark|11|22|And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark|11|23|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.
Mark|11|24|Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
Mark|11|25|And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
Mark|11|26|{But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.}
Mark|11|27|And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;
Mark|11|28|and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?
Mark|11|29|And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|11|30|The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.
Mark|11|31|And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Mark|11|32|But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.
Mark|11|33|And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|12|1|And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Mark|12|2|And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.
Mark|12|3|And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
Mark|12|4|And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.
Mark|12|5|And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Mark|12|6|He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark|12|7|But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
Mark|12|8|And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.
Mark|12|9|What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
Mark|12|10|Have ye not read even this scripture:             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner;
Mark|12|11|This was from the Lord,                   And it is marvellous in our eyes?
Mark|12|12|And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.
Mark|12|13|And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.
Mark|12|14|And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Mark|12|15|Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why make ye trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
Mark|12|16|And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
Mark|12|17|And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.
Mark|12|18|And there come unto him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Mark|12|19|Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mark|12|20|There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;
Mark|12|21|and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:
Mark|12|22|and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
Mark|12|23|In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
Mark|12|24|Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
Mark|12|25|For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.
Mark|12|26|But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in {the place concerning} the Bush, how God spake unto him, saying, I {am} the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark|12|27|He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err.
Mark|12|28|And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?
Mark|12|29|Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:
Mark|12|30|and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
Mark|12|31|The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
Mark|12|32|And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:
Mark|12|33|and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
Mark|12|34|And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
Mark|12|35|And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark|12|36|David himself said in the Holy Spirit,             The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Mark|12|37|David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark|12|38|And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and {to have} salutations in the marketplaces,
Mark|12|39|and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:
Mark|12|40|they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.
Mark|12|41|And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
Mark|12|42|And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.
Mark|12|43|And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury:
Mark|12|44|for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, {even} all her living.
Mark|13|1|And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings!
Mark|13|2|And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.
Mark|13|3|And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Mark|13|4|Tell us, when shall these things be? and what {shall be} the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?
Mark|13|5|And Jesus began to say unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
Mark|13|6|Many shall come in my name, saying, I am {he}; and shall lead many astray.
Mark|13|7|And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled: {these things} must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
Mark|13|8|For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail.
Mark|13|9|But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|13|10|And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations.
Mark|13|11|And when they lead you {to judgment}, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
Mark|13|12|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Mark|13|13|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Mark|13|14|But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains:
Mark|13|15|and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out his house:
Mark|13|16|and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
Mark|13|17|But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
Mark|13|18|And pray ye that it be not in the winter.
Mark|13|19|For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be.
Mark|13|20|And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect’s sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days.
Mark|13|21|And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there; believe {it} not:
Mark|13|22|for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.
Mark|13|23|But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
Mark|13|24|But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
Mark|13|25|and the stars shall be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.
Mark|13|26|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Mark|13|27|And then shall he send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Mark|13|28|Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;
Mark|13|29|even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is nigh, {even} at the doors.
Mark|13|30|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished.
Mark|13|31|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark|13|32|But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Mark|13|33|Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark|13|34|{It is} as {when} a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch.
Mark|13|35|Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning;
Mark|13|36|lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark|13|37|And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
Mark|14|1|Now after two days was {the feast of} the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him:
Mark|14|2|for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people.
Mark|14|3|And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; {and} she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.
Mark|14|4|But there were some that had indignation among themselves, {saying}, To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made?
Mark|14|5|For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
Mark|14|6|But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
Mark|14|7|For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always.
Mark|14|8|She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
Mark|14|9|And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
Mark|14|10|And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them.
Mark|14|11|And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him {unto them}.
Mark|14|12|And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover?
Mark|14|13|And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him;
Mark|14|14|and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Mark|14|15|And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished {and} ready: and there make ready for us.
Mark|14|16|And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Mark|14|17|And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark|14|18|And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, {even} he that eateth with me.
Mark|14|19|They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?
Mark|14|20|And he said unto them, {It is} one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish.
Mark|14|21|For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
Mark|14|22|And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body.
Mark|14|23|And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark|14|24|And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
Mark|14|25|Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Mark|14|26|And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.
Mark|14|27|And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.
Mark|14|28|Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark|14|29|But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
Mark|14|30|And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, {even} this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.
Mark|14|31|But he spake exceedingly vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.
Mark|14|32|And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.
Mark|14|33|And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled.
Mark|14|34|And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch.
Mark|14|35|And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
Mark|14|36|And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark|14|37|And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour?
Mark|14|38|Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Mark|14|39|And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
Mark|14|40|And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
Mark|14|41|And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark|14|42|Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark|14|43|And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark|14|44|Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
Mark|14|45|And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.
Mark|14|46|And they laid hands on him, and took him.
Mark|14|47|But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
Mark|14|48|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?
Mark|14|49|I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but {this is done} that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
Mark|14|50|And they all left him, and fled.
Mark|14|51|And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over {his} naked {body}: and they lay hold on him;
Mark|14|52|but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
Mark|14|53|And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark|14|54|And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light {of the fire}.
Mark|14|55|Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.
Mark|14|56|For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.
Mark|14|57|And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark|14|58|We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark|14|59|And not even so did their witness agree together.
Mark|14|60|And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Mark|14|61|But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark|14|62|And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
Mark|14|63|And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses?
Mark|14|64|Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
Mark|14|65|And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.
Mark|14|66|And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest;
Mark|14|67|and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, {even} Jesus.
Mark|14|68|But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark|14|69|And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is {one} of them.
Mark|14|70|But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, of a truth thou art {one} of them; for thou art a Galilaean.
Mark|14|71|But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
Mark|14|72|And straightway the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
Mark|15|1|And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
Mark|15|2|And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.
Mark|15|3|And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark|15|4|And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.
Mark|15|5|But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.
Mark|15|6|Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
Mark|15|7|And there was one called Barabbas, {lying} bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
Mark|15|8|And the multitude went up and began to ask him {to do} as he was wont to do unto them.
Mark|15|9|And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|10|For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark|15|11|But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark|15|12|And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|13|And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark|15|14|And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark|15|15|And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
Mark|15|16|And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark|15|17|And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
Mark|15|18|and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark|15|19|And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
Mark|15|20|And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.
Mark|15|21|And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go {with them}, that he might bear his cross.
Mark|15|22|And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark|15|23|And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
Mark|15|24|And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.
Mark|15|25|And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark|15|26|And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark|15|27|And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
Mark|15|28|{And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.}
Mark|15|29|And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
Mark|15|30|save thyself, and come down from the cross.
Mark|15|31|In like manner also the chief priests mocking {him} among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Mark|15|32|Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.
Mark|15|33|And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark|15|34|And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark|15|35|And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.
Mark|15|36|And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.
Mark|15|37|And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark|15|38|And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
Mark|15|39|And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark|15|40|And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom {were} both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark|15|41|who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Mark|15|42|And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
Mark|15|43|there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark|15|44|And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark|15|45|And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mark|15|46|And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mark|15|47|And Mary Magdalene and Mary the {mother} of Joses beheld where he was laid.
Mark|16|1|And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the {mother} of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark|16|2|And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.
Mark|16|3|And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?
Mark|16|4|and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.
Mark|16|5|And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.
Mark|16|6|And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!
Mark|16|7|But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
Mark|16|8|And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.
Mark|16|9|Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
Mark|16|10|She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark|16|11|And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.
Mark|16|12|And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.
Mark|16|13|And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.
Mark|16|14|And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.
Mark|16|15|And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.
Mark|16|16|He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.
Mark|16|17|And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark|16|18|they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Mark|16|19|So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark|16|20|And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
Daniel|1|1|In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
Daniel|1|2|And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
Daniel|1|3|And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in {certain} of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;
Daniel|1|4|youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
Daniel|1|5|And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.
Daniel|1|6|Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
Daniel|1|7|And the prince of the eunuchs gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave {the name of} Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, {of} Shadrach; and to Mishael, {of} Meshach; and to Azariah, {of} Abed-nego.
Daniel|1|8|But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
Daniel|1|9|Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
Daniel|1|10|And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.
Daniel|1|11|Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
Daniel|1|12|Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
Daniel|1|13|Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
Daniel|1|14|So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
Daniel|1|15|And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties.
Daniel|1|16|So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
Daniel|1|17|Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
Daniel|1|18|And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel|1|19|And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
Daniel|1|20|And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.
Daniel|1|21|And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
Daniel|2|1|And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.
Daniel|2|2|Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
Daniel|2|3|And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
Daniel|2|4|Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
Daniel|2|5|The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
Daniel|2|6|But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|2|7|They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
Daniel|2|8|The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
Daniel|2|9|But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|2|10|The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.
Daniel|2|11|And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
Daniel|2|12|For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|13|So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
Daniel|2|14|Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
Daniel|2|15|he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
Daniel|2|16|And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|17|Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
Daniel|2|18|that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|19|Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel|2|20|Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.
Daniel|2|21|And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;
Daniel|2|22|he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
Daniel|2|23|I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.
Daniel|2|24|Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|25|Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|26|The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
Daniel|2|27|Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;
Daniel|2|28|but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:
Daniel|2|29|as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came {into thy mind} upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.
Daniel|2|30|But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
Daniel|2|31|Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.
Daniel|2|32|As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,
Daniel|2|33|its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.
Daniel|2|34|Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.
Daniel|2|35|Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
Daniel|2|36|This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel|2|37|Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;
Daniel|2|38|and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.
Daniel|2|39|And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
Daniel|2|40|And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.
Daniel|2|41|And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
Daniel|2|42|And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
Daniel|2|43|And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.
Daniel|2|44|And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
Daniel|2|45|Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
Daniel|2|46|Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.
Daniel|2|47|The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.
Daniel|2|48|Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|49|And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.
Daniel|3|1|Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
Daniel|3|2|Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel|3|3|Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Daniel|3|4|Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
Daniel|3|5|that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;
Daniel|3|6|and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|7|Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel|3|8|Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.
Daniel|3|9|They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel|3|10|Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;
Daniel|3|11|and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|12|There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Daniel|3|13|Then Nebuchadnezzar in {his} rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
Daniel|3|14|Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
Daniel|3|15|Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, {well}: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?
Daniel|3|16|Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
Daniel|3|17|If it be {so}, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.
Daniel|3|18|But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Daniel|3|19|Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: {therefore} he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
Daniel|3|20|And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, {and} to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|21|Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their {other} garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|22|Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
Daniel|3|23|And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|24|Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
Daniel|3|25|He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
Daniel|3|26|Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.
Daniel|3|27|And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
Daniel|3|28|Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
Daniel|3|29|Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.
Daniel|3|30|Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.
Daniel|4|1|Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
Daniel|4|2|It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
Daniel|4|3|How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel|4|4|I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
Daniel|4|5|I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
Daniel|4|6|Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
Daniel|4|7|Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|4|8|But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and I told the dream before him, {saying},
Daniel|4|9|O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|4|10|Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.
Daniel|4|11|The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.
Daniel|4|12|The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.
Daniel|4|13|I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.
Daniel|4|14|He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
Daniel|4|15|Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
Daniel|4|16|let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
Daniel|4|17|The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.
Daniel|4|18|This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
Daniel|4|19|Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.
Daniel|4|20|The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
Daniel|4|21|whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:
Daniel|4|22|it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
Daniel|4|23|And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
Daniel|4|24|this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
Daniel|4|25|that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
Daniel|4|26|And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
Daniel|4|27|Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
Daniel|4|28|All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel|4|29|At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel|4|30|The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?
Daniel|4|31|While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, {saying}, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:
Daniel|4|32|and thou shalt be driven from men; and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
Daniel|4|33|The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’ {feathers}, and his nails like birds’ {claws}.
Daniel|4|34|And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.
Daniel|4|35|And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
Daniel|4|36|At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.
Daniel|4|37|Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.
Daniel|5|1|Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
Daniel|5|2|Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.
Daniel|5|3|Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.
Daniel|5|4|They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
Daniel|5|5|In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Daniel|5|6|Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
Daniel|5|7|The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|8|Then came in all the king’s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
Daniel|5|9|Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
Daniel|5|10|{Now} the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.
Daniel|5|11|There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, {I say}, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
Daniel|5|12|forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
Daniel|5|13|Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
Daniel|5|14|I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.
Daniel|5|15|And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.
Daniel|5|16|But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|17|Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
Daniel|5|18|O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:
Daniel|5|19|and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.
Daniel|5|20|But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
Daniel|5|21|and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts’, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.
Daniel|5|22|And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,
Daniel|5|23|but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.
Daniel|5|24|Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
Daniel|5|25|And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
Daniel|5|26|This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;
Daniel|5|27|TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
Daniel|5|28|PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
Daniel|5|29|Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|30|In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
Daniel|5|31|And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
Daniel|6|1|It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;
Daniel|6|2|and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.
Daniel|6|3|Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
Daniel|6|4|Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
Daniel|6|5|Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
Daniel|6|6|Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
Daniel|6|7|All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel|6|8|Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|9|Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
Daniel|6|10|And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
Daniel|6|11|Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel|6|12|Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|13|Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
Daniel|6|14|Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.
Daniel|6|15|Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
Daniel|6|16|Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. {Now} the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
Daniel|6|17|And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
Daniel|6|18|Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.
Daniel|6|19|Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
Daniel|6|20|And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
Daniel|6|21|Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel|6|22|My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Daniel|6|23|Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel|6|24|And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
Daniel|6|25|Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
Daniel|6|26|I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
Daniel|6|27|He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
Daniel|6|28|So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel|7|1|In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
Daniel|7|2|Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.
Daniel|7|3|And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
Daniel|7|4|The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.
Daniel|7|5|And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
Daniel|7|6|After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
Daniel|7|7|After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
Daniel|7|8|I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
Daniel|7|9|I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, {and} the wheels thereof burning fire.
Daniel|7|10|A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
Daniel|7|11|I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
Daniel|7|12|And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
Daniel|7|13|I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
Daniel|7|14|And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
Daniel|7|15|As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
Daniel|7|16|I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
Daniel|7|17|These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.
Daniel|7|18|But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
Daniel|7|19|Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
Daniel|7|20|and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other {horn} which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.
Daniel|7|21|I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
Daniel|7|22|until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
Daniel|7|23|Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
Daniel|7|24|And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
Daniel|7|25|And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
Daniel|7|26|But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
Daniel|7|27|And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
Daniel|7|28|Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
Daniel|8|1|In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
Daniel|8|2|And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
Daniel|8|3|Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
Daniel|8|4|I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
Daniel|8|5|And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
Daniel|8|6|And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.
Daniel|8|7|And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
Daniel|8|8|And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable {horns} toward the four winds of heaven.
Daniel|8|9|And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious {land}.
Daniel|8|10|And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
Daniel|8|11|Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual {burnt-offering}, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
Daniel|8|12|And the host was given over {to it} together with the continual {burnt-offering} through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did {its pleasure} and prospered.
Daniel|8|13|Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision {concerning} the continual {burnt-offering}, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
Daniel|8|14|And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings {and} mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
Daniel|8|15|And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
Daniel|8|16|And I heard a man’s voice between {the banks of} the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
Daniel|8|17|So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.
Daniel|8|18|Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
Daniel|8|19|And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.
Daniel|8|20|The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel|8|21|And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel|8|22|And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
Daniel|8|23|And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
Daniel|8|24|And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do {his pleasure}; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.
Daniel|8|25|And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in {their} security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
Daniel|8|26|And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days {to come}.
Daniel|8|27|And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.
Daniel|9|1|In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,
Daniel|9|2|in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.
Daniel|9|3|And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel|9|4|And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,
Daniel|9|5|we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;
Daniel|9|6|neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
Daniel|9|7|O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
Daniel|9|8|O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
Daniel|9|9|To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;
Daniel|9|10|neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
Daniel|9|11|Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.
Daniel|9|12|And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
Daniel|9|13|As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.
Daniel|9|14|Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.
Daniel|9|15|And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
Daniel|9|16|O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.
Daniel|9|17|Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
Daniel|9|18|O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies’ sake.
Daniel|9|19|O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
Daniel|9|20|And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Daniel|9|21|yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
Daniel|9|22|And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.
Daniel|9|23|At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.
Daniel|9|24|Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.
Daniel|9|25|Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.
Daniel|9|26|And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.
Daniel|9|27|And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations {shall come} one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall {wrath} be poured out upon the desolate.
Daniel|10|1|In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
Daniel|10|2|In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.
Daniel|10|3|I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
Daniel|10|4|And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,
Daniel|10|5|I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:
Daniel|10|6|his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
Daniel|10|7|And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
Daniel|10|8|So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
Daniel|10|9|Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.
Daniel|10|10|And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
Daniel|10|11|And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
Daniel|10|12|Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words’ sake.
Daniel|10|13|But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Daniel|10|14|Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for {many} days:
Daniel|10|15|and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.
Daniel|10|16|And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
Daniel|10|17|For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.
Daniel|10|18|Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.
Daniel|10|19|And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
Daniel|10|20|Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.
Daniel|10|21|But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.
Daniel|11|1|And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
Daniel|11|2|And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
Daniel|11|3|And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
Daniel|11|4|And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.
Daniel|11|5|And the king of the south shall be strong, and {one} of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
Daniel|11|6|And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.
Daniel|11|7|But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.
Daniel|11|8|And also their gods, with their molten images, {and} with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.
Daniel|11|9|And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.
Daniel|11|10|And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.
Daniel|11|11|And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.
Daniel|11|12|And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
Daniel|11|13|And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, {even of} years, with a great army and with much substance.
Daniel|11|14|And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
Daniel|11|15|So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.
Daniel|11|16|But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.
Daniel|11|17|And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.
Daniel|11|18|After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.
Daniel|11|19|Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
Daniel|11|20|Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
Daniel|11|21|And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
Daniel|11|22|And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
Daniel|11|23|And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.
Daniel|11|24|In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
Daniel|11|25|And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.
Daniel|11|26|Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.
Daniel|11|27|And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
Daniel|11|28|Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart {shall be} against the holy covenant; and he shall do {his pleasure}, and return to his own land.
Daniel|11|29|At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.
Daniel|11|30|For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do {his pleasure}: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel|11|31|And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual {burnt-offering}, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.
Daniel|11|32|And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do {exploits}.
Daniel|11|33|And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, {many} days.
Daniel|11|34|Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.
Daniel|11|35|And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
Daniel|11|36|And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.
Daniel|11|37|Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.
Daniel|11|38|But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
Daniel|11|39|And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth {him} he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.
Daniel|11|40|And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.
Daniel|11|41|He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many {countries} shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
Daniel|11|42|He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
Daniel|11|43|But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
Daniel|11|44|But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.
Daniel|11|45|And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
Daniel|12|1|And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
Daniel|12|2|And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
Daniel|12|3|And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
Daniel|12|4|But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
Daniel|12|5|Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.
Daniel|12|6|And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
Daniel|12|7|And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
Daniel|12|8|And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?
Daniel|12|9|And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.
Daniel|12|10|Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand.
Daniel|12|11|And from the time that the continual {burnt-offering} shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.
Daniel|12|12|Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
Daniel|12|13|But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days.
Esther|1|1|Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),
Esther|1|2|that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
Esther|1|3|in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;
Esther|1|4|when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.
Esther|1|5|And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
Esther|1|6|{There were hangings of} white {cloth}, {of} green, and {of} blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.
Esther|1|7|And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.
Esther|1|8|And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.
Esther|1|9|Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther|1|10|On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
Esther|1|11|to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.
Esther|1|12|But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
Esther|1|13|Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;
Esther|1|14|and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),
Esther|1|15|What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
Esther|1|16|And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|1|17|For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
Esther|1|18|And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say {the like} unto all the king’s princes. So {will there arise} much contempt and wrath.
Esther|1|19|If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
Esther|1|20|And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
Esther|1|21|And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
Esther|1|22|for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.
Esther|2|1|After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
Esther|2|2|Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
Esther|2|3|and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;
Esther|2|4|and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
Esther|2|5|There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
Esther|2|6|who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
Esther|2|7|And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
Esther|2|8|So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
Esther|2|9|And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.
Esther|2|10|Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.
Esther|2|11|And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
Esther|2|12|Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, {to wit}, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),
Esther|2|13|then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
Esther|2|14|In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.
Esther|2|15|Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
Esther|2|16|So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
Esther|2|17|And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther|2|18|Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.
Esther|2|19|And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.
Esther|2|20|Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
Esther|2|21|In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|2|22|And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king {thereof} in Mordecai’s name.
Esther|2|23|And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
Esther|3|1|After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
Esther|3|2|And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.
Esther|3|3|Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
Esther|3|4|Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther|3|5|And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
Esther|3|6|But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
Esther|3|7|In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, {to} the twelfth {month}, which is the month Adar.
Esther|3|8|And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from {those of} every people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.
Esther|3|9|If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the {king’s} business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
Esther|3|10|And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
Esther|3|11|And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
Esther|3|12|Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.
Esther|3|13|And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth {day} of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
Esther|3|14|A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
Esther|3|15|The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
Esther|4|1|Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
Esther|4|2|and he came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
Esther|4|3|And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
Esther|4|4|And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.
Esther|4|5|Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.
Esther|4|6|So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate.
Esther|4|7|And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
Esther|4|8|Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.
Esther|4|9|And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther|4|10|Then Esther spake unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai {saying}:
Esther|4|11|All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
Esther|4|12|And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther|4|13|Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
Esther|4|14|For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
Esther|4|15|Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,
Esther|4|16|Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
Esther|4|17|So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
Esther|5|1|Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.
Esther|5|2|And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
Esther|5|3|Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.
Esther|5|4|And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
Esther|5|5|Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
Esther|5|6|And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther|5|7|Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:
Esther|5|8|if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.
Esther|5|9|Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
Esther|5|10|Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.
Esther|5|11|And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
Esther|5|12|Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.
Esther|5|13|Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.
Esther|5|14|Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
Esther|6|1|On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
Esther|6|2|And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|6|3|And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
Esther|6|4|And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
Esther|6|5|And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
Esther|6|6|So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
Esther|6|7|And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
Esther|6|8|let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:
Esther|6|9|and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
Esther|6|10|Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
Esther|6|11|Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
Esther|6|12|And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
Esther|6|13|And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
Esther|6|14|While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
Esther|7|1|So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther|7|2|And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther|7|3|Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
Esther|7|4|for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.
Esther|7|5|Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
Esther|7|6|And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
Esther|7|7|And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine {and went} into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther|7|8|Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
Esther|7|9|Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.
Esther|7|10|So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.
Esther|8|1|On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
Esther|8|2|And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
Esther|8|3|And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
Esther|8|4|Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.
Esther|8|5|And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces:
Esther|8|6|for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Esther|8|7|Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
Esther|8|8|Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.
Esther|8|9|Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month Sivan, on the three and twentieth {day} thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
Esther|8|10|And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud:
Esther|8|11|wherein the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, {their} little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
Esther|8|12|upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, {namely}, upon the thirteenth {day} of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
Esther|8|13|A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
Esther|8|14|So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.
Esther|8|15|And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.
Esther|8|16|The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.
Esther|8|17|And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.
Esther|9|1|Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them, (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them,)
Esther|9|2|the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.
Esther|9|3|And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.
Esther|9|4|For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
Esther|9|5|And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.
Esther|9|6|And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther|9|7|And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
Esther|9|8|and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
Esther|9|9|and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,
Esther|9|10|the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew’s enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|11|On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther|9|12|And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
Esther|9|13|Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
Esther|9|14|And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
Esther|9|15|And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|16|And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|17|{This was done} on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther|9|18|But the Jews that were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth {day} thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth {day} of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther|9|19|Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar {a day of} gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
Esther|9|20|And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
Esther|9|21|to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
Esther|9|22|as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
Esther|9|23|And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
Esther|9|24|because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
Esther|9|25|but when {the matter} came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Esther|9|26|Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,
Esther|9|27|the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year;
Esther|9|28|and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.
Esther|9|29|Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
Esther|9|30|And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, {with} words of peace and truth,
Esther|9|31|to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.
Esther|9|32|And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
Esther|10|1|And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
Esther|10|2|And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
Esther|10|3|For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
Nehemiah|1|1|The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
Nehemiah|1|2|that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|1|3|And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
Nehemiah|1|4|And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
Nehemiah|1|5|and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:
Nehemiah|1|6|Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father’s house have sinned:
Nehemiah|1|7|we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
Nehemiah|1|8|Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:
Nehemiah|1|9|but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.
Nehemiah|1|10|Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
Nehemiah|1|11|O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.
Nehemiah|2|1|And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been {beforetime} sad in his presence.
Nehemiah|2|2|And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.
Nehemiah|2|3|And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
Nehemiah|2|4|Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah|2|5|And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.
Nehemiah|2|6|And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
Nehemiah|2|7|Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;
Nehemiah|2|8|and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
Nehemiah|2|9|Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah|2|10|And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
Nehemiah|2|11|So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
Nehemiah|2|12|And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
Nehemiah|2|13|And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
Nehemiah|2|14|Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
Nehemiah|2|15|Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.
Nehemiah|2|16|And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
Nehemiah|2|17|Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
Nehemiah|2|18|And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good {work}.
Nehemiah|2|19|But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
Nehemiah|2|20|Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|3|1|Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah|3|2|And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
Nehemiah|3|3|And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.
Nehemiah|3|4|And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.
Nehemiah|3|5|And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord.
Nehemiah|3|6|And the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.
Nehemiah|3|7|And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, {that appertained} to the throne of the governor beyond the River.
Nehemiah|3|8|Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even unto the broad wall.
Nehemiah|3|9|And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|3|10|And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah.
Nehemiah|3|11|Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces.
Nehemiah|3|12|And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
Nehemiah|3|13|The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate.
Nehemiah|3|14|And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.
Nehemiah|3|15|And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.
Nehemiah|3|16|After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men.
Nehemiah|3|17|After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district.
Nehemiah|3|18|After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah.
Nehemiah|3|19|And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armory at the turning {of the wall}.
Nehemiah|3|20|After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning {of the wall} unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
Nehemiah|3|21|After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
Nehemiah|3|22|And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain.
Nehemiah|3|23|After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house.
Nehemiah|3|24|After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the turning {of the wall}, and unto the corner.
Nehemiah|3|25|Palal the son of Uzai {repaired} over against the turning {of the wall}, and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh {repaired}.
Nehemiah|3|26|(Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.)
Nehemiah|3|27|After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel.
Nehemiah|3|28|Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house.
Nehemiah|3|29|After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate.
Nehemiah|3|30|After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.
Nehemiah|3|31|After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.
Nehemiah|3|32|And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
Nehemiah|4|1|But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
Nehemiah|4|2|And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?
Nehemiah|4|3|Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.
Nehemiah|4|4|Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;
Nehemiah|4|5|and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked {thee} to anger before the builders.
Nehemiah|4|6|So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half {the height} thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah|4|7|But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, {and} that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;
Nehemiah|4|8|and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.
Nehemiah|4|9|But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
Nehemiah|4|10|And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
Nehemiah|4|11|And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
Nehemiah|4|12|And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.
Nehemiah|4|13|Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set {there} the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
Nehemiah|4|14|And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
Nehemiah|4|15|And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
Nehemiah|4|16|And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
Nehemiah|4|17|They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;
Nehemiah|4|18|and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
Nehemiah|4|19|And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:
Nehemiah|4|20|in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.
Nehemiah|4|21|So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
Nehemiah|4|22|Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.
Nehemiah|4|23|So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one {went with} his weapon {to} the water.
Nehemiah|5|1|Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
Nehemiah|5|2|For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.
Nehemiah|5|3|Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.
Nehemiah|5|4|There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute {upon} our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah|5|5|Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage {already}: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah|5|6|And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah|5|7|Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.
Nehemiah|5|8|And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.
Nehemiah|5|9|Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?
Nehemiah|5|10|And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
Nehemiah|5|11|Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
Nehemiah|5|12|Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
Nehemiah|5|13|Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.
Nehemiah|5|14|Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, {that is}, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
Nehemiah|5|15|But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
Nehemiah|5|16|Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.
Nehemiah|5|17|Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.
Nehemiah|5|18|Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
Nehemiah|5|19|Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
Nehemiah|6|1|Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)
Nehemiah|6|2|that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in {one of} the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
Nehemiah|6|3|And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
Nehemiah|6|4|And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
Nehemiah|6|5|Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,
Nehemiah|6|6|wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.
Nehemiah|6|7|And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
Nehemiah|6|8|Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
Nehemiah|6|9|For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, {O God}, strengthen thou my hands.
Nehemiah|6|10|And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
Nehemiah|6|11|And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
Nehemiah|6|12|And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah|6|13|For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
Nehemiah|6|14|Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
Nehemiah|6|15|So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth {day} of {the month} Elul, in fifty and two days.
Nehemiah|6|16|And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard {thereof}, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
Nehemiah|6|17|Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and {the letters} of Tobiah came unto them.
Nehemiah|6|18|For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.
Nehemiah|6|19|Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. {And} Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
Nehemiah|7|1|Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
Nehemiah|7|2|that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
Nehemiah|7|3|And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand {on guard}, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one {to be} over against his house.
Nehemiah|7|4|Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
Nehemiah|7|5|And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:
Nehemiah|7|6|These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;
Nehemiah|7|7|who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Nehemiah|7|59|the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon.
Nehemiah|7|60|All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
Nehemiah|7|61|And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:
Nehemiah|7|62|The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.
Nehemiah|7|63|And of the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
Nehemiah|7|64|These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
Nehemiah|7|65|And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
Nehemiah|7|66|The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
Nehemiah|7|67|besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.
Nehemiah|7|68|Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
Nehemiah|7|69|{their} camels, four hundred thirty and five; {their} asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
Nehemiah|7|70|And some from among the heads of fathers’ {houses} gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments.
Nehemiah|7|71|And some of the heads of fathers’ {houses} gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
Nehemiah|7|72|And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests’ garments.
Nehemiah|7|73|So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.
Nehemiah|8|1|And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.
Nehemiah|8|2|And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
Nehemiah|8|3|And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were {attentive} unto the book of the law.
Nehemiah|8|4|And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, {and} Meshullam.
Nehemiah|8|5|And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
Nehemiah|8|6|and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.
Nehemiah|8|7|Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people {stood} in their place.
Nehemiah|8|8|And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.
Nehemiah|8|9|And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
Nehemiah|8|10|Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.
Nehemiah|8|11|So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
Nehemiah|8|12|And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
Nehemiah|8|13|And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’ {houses} of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.
Nehemiah|8|14|And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;
Nehemiah|8|15|and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
Nehemiah|8|16|So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah|8|17|And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
Nehemiah|8|18|Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.
Nehemiah|9|1|Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.
Nehemiah|9|2|And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah|9|3|And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and {another} fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.
Nehemiah|9|4|Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, {and} Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.
Nehemiah|9|5|Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, {and} Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
Nehemiah|9|6|Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
Nehemiah|9|7|Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,
Nehemiah|9|8|and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.
Nehemiah|9|9|And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,
Nehemiah|9|10|and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.
Nehemiah|9|11|And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.
Nehemiah|9|12|Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
Nehemiah|9|13|Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
Nehemiah|9|14|and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,
Nehemiah|9|15|and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
Nehemiah|9|16|But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
Nehemiah|9|17|and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.
Nehemiah|9|18|Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
Nehemiah|9|19|yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
Nehemiah|9|20|Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
Nehemiah|9|21|Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, {and} they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
Nehemiah|9|22|Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
Nehemiah|9|23|Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
Nehemiah|9|24|So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
Nehemiah|9|25|And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
Nehemiah|9|26|Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.
Nehemiah|9|27|Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.
Nehemiah|9|28|But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,
Nehemiah|9|29|and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
Nehemiah|9|30|Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah|9|31|Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
Nehemiah|9|32|Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
Nehemiah|9|33|Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;
Nehemiah|9|34|neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.
Nehemiah|9|35|For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
Nehemiah|9|36|Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.
Nehemiah|9|37|And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
Nehemiah|9|38|And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, {and} our priests, seal unto it.
Nehemiah|10|1|Now those that sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,
Nehemiah|10|2|Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
Nehemiah|10|3|Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
Nehemiah|10|4|Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
Nehemiah|10|5|Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
Nehemiah|10|6|Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
Nehemiah|10|7|Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
Nehemiah|10|8|Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah; these were the priests.
Nehemiah|10|9|And the Levites: namely, Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
Nehemiah|10|10|and their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
Nehemiah|10|11|Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,
Nehemiah|10|12|Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
Nehemiah|10|13|Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.
Nehemiah|10|14|The chiefs of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
Nehemiah|10|15|Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
Nehemiah|10|16|Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
Nehemiah|10|17|Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
Nehemiah|10|18|Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
Nehemiah|10|19|Hariph, Anathoth, Nobai,
Nehemiah|10|20|Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
Nehemiah|10|21|Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
Nehemiah|10|22|Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
Nehemiah|10|23|Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
Nehemiah|10|24|Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
Nehemiah|10|25|Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
Nehemiah|10|26|and Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
Nehemiah|10|27|Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
Nehemiah|10|28|And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge, and understanding;
Nehemiah|10|29|They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;
Nehemiah|10|30|and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons;
Nehemiah|10|31|and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
Nehemiah|10|32|Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;
Nehemiah|10|33|for the showbread, and for the continual meal-offering, and for the continual burnt-offering, for the sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
Nehemiah|10|34|And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of Jehovah our God, as it is written in the law;
Nehemiah|10|35|and to bring the first-fruits of our ground, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of Jehovah;
Nehemiah|10|36|also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God;
Nehemiah|10|37|and that we should bring the first-fruits of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the new wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
Nehemiah|10|38|And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure-house.
Nehemiah|10|39|For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave-offering of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
Nehemiah|11|1|And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the {other} cities.
Nehemiah|11|2|And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|11|3|Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, {to wit}, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants.
Nehemiah|11|4|And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;
Nehemiah|11|5|and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite.
Nehemiah|11|6|All the sons of Perez that dwelt in Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men.
Nehemiah|11|7|And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
Nehemiah|11|8|And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.
Nehemiah|11|9|And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city.
Nehemiah|11|10|Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin,
Nehemiah|11|11|Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God,
Nehemiah|11|12|and their brethren that did the work of the house, eight hundred twenty and two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,
Nehemiah|11|13|and his brethren, chiefs of fathers’ {houses}, two hundred forty and two; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
Nehemiah|11|14|and their brethren, mighty men of valor, a hundred twenty and eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
Nehemiah|11|15|And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
Nehemiah|11|16|and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God;
Nehemiah|11|17|and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
Nehemiah|11|18|All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.
Nehemiah|11|19|Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two.
Nehemiah|11|20|And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.
Nehemiah|11|21|But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.
Nehemiah|11|22|The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God.
Nehemiah|11|23|For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required.
Nehemiah|11|24|And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people.
Nehemiah|11|25|And as for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof,
Nehemiah|11|26|and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet,
Nehemiah|11|27|and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof,
Nehemiah|11|28|and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof,
Nehemiah|11|29|and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth,
Nehemiah|11|30|Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
Nehemiah|11|31|The children of Benjamin also {dwelt} from Geba {onward}, at Michmash and Aija, and at Beth-el and the towns thereof,
Nehemiah|11|32|at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
Nehemiah|11|33|Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
Nehemiah|11|34|Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
Nehemiah|11|35|Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
Nehemiah|11|36|And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah {were joined} to Benjamin.
Nehemiah|12|1|Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
Nehemiah|12|2|Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
Nehemiah|12|3|Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
Nehemiah|12|4|Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
Nehemiah|12|5|Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
Nehemiah|12|6|Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah.
Nehemiah|12|7|Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
Nehemiah|12|8|Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, {and} Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
Nehemiah|12|9|Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, were over against them according to their offices.
Nehemiah|12|10|And Jeshua begat Joiakim, and Joiakim begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
Nehemiah|12|11|and Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
Nehemiah|12|12|And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’ {houses}: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
Nehemiah|12|13|of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
Nehemiah|12|14|of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
Nehemiah|12|15|of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
Nehemiah|12|16|of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
Nehemiah|12|17|of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
Nehemiah|12|18|of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
Nehemiah|12|19|and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
Nehemiah|12|20|of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
Nehemiah|12|21|of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
Nehemiah|12|22|As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers’ {houses}; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
Nehemiah|12|23|The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ {houses}, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
Nehemiah|12|24|And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch.
Nehemiah|12|25|Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates.
Nehemiah|12|26|These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
Nehemiah|12|27|And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
Nehemiah|12|28|And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;
Nehemiah|12|29|also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|12|30|And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
Nehemiah|12|31|Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; {whereof one went} on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
Nehemiah|12|32|and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
Nehemiah|12|33|and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
Nehemiah|12|34|Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
Nehemiah|12|35|and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
Nehemiah|12|36|and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.
Nehemiah|12|37|And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
Nehemiah|12|38|And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,
Nehemiah|12|39|and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.
Nehemiah|12|40|So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;
Nehemiah|12|41|and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
Nehemiah|12|42|and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
Nehemiah|12|43|And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
Nehemiah|12|44|And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
Nehemiah|12|45|And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and {so did} the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
Nehemiah|12|46|For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
Nehemiah|12|47|And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart {that which was} for the Levites; and the Levites set apart {that which was} for the sons of Aaron.
Nehemiah|13|1|On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,
Nehemiah|13|2|because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah|13|3|And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
Nehemiah|13|4|Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,
Nehemiah|13|5|had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.
Nehemiah|13|6|But in all this {time} I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,
Nehemiah|13|7|and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah|13|8|And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah|13|9|Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah|13|10|And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
Nehemiah|13|11|Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
Nehemiah|13|12|Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah|13|13|And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.
Nehemiah|13|14|Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.
Nehemiah|13|15|In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses {therewith}; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified {against them} in the day wherein they sold victuals.
Nehemiah|13|16|There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|13|17|Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
Nehemiah|13|18|Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|19|And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
Nehemiah|13|20|So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah|13|21|Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|22|And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.
Nehemiah|13|23|In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, {and} of Moab:
Nehemiah|13|24|and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.
Nehemiah|13|25|And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, {saying}, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
Nehemiah|13|26|Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
Nehemiah|13|27|Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
Nehemiah|13|28|And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah|13|29|Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
Nehemiah|13|30|Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;
Nehemiah|13|31|and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
Ruth|1|1|And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
Ruth|1|2|And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
Ruth|1|3|And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
Ruth|1|4|And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
Ruth|1|5|And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
Ruth|1|6|Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.
Ruth|1|7|And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
Ruth|1|8|And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
Ruth|1|9|Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
Ruth|1|10|And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.
Ruth|1|11|And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth|1|12|Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;
Ruth|1|13|would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.
Ruth|1|14|And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.
Ruth|1|15|And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.
Ruth|1|16|And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
Ruth|1|17|where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.
Ruth|1|18|And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.
Ruth|1|19|So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and {the women} said, Is this Naomi?
Ruth|1|20|And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth|1|21|I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
Ruth|1|22|So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
Ruth|2|1|And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
Ruth|2|2|And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
Ruth|2|3|And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth|2|4|And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.
Ruth|2|5|Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
Ruth|2|6|And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
Ruth|2|7|And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.
Ruth|2|8|Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
Ruth|2|9|Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
Ruth|2|10|Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
Ruth|2|11|And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.
Ruth|2|12|Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
Ruth|2|13|Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.
Ruth|2|14|And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.
Ruth|2|15|And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
Ruth|2|16|And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.
Ruth|2|17|So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Ruth|2|18|And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
Ruth|2|19|And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.
Ruth|2|20|And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.
Ruth|2|21|And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
Ruth|2|22|And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.
Ruth|2|23|So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
Ruth|3|1|And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
Ruth|3|2|And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
Ruth|3|3|Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
Ruth|3|4|And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
Ruth|3|5|And she said unto her, All that thou sayest I will do.
Ruth|3|6|And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.
Ruth|3|7|And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
Ruth|3|8|And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
Ruth|3|9|And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
Ruth|3|10|And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
Ruth|3|11|And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.
Ruth|3|12|And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth|3|13|Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Jehovah liveth: lie down until the morning.
Ruth|3|14|And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
Ruth|3|15|And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it; and she held it; and he measured six {measures} of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.
Ruth|3|16|And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
Ruth|3|17|And she said, These six {measures} of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.
Ruth|3|18|Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.
Ruth|4|1|Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
Ruth|4|2|And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
Ruth|4|3|And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:
Ruth|4|4|And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
Ruth|4|5|Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
Ruth|4|6|And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.
Ruth|4|7|Now this was {the custom} in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the {manner of} attestation in Israel.
Ruth|4|8|So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
Ruth|4|9|And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
Ruth|4|10|Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
Ruth|4|11|And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
Ruth|4|12|and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman.
Ruth|4|13|So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son.
Ruth|4|14|And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.
Ruth|4|15|And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
Ruth|4|16|And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
Ruth|4|17|And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Ruth|4|18|Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,
Ruth|4|19|and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
Ruth|4|20|and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
Ruth|4|21|and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
Ruth|4|22|and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
Numbers|1|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers|1|2|Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, every male, by their polls;
Numbers|1|3|from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel, thou and Aaron shall number them by their hosts.
Numbers|1|4|And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of his fathers’ house.

Numbers|1|16|These are they that were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.
Numbers|1|17|And Moses and Aaron took these men that are mentioned by name:
Numbers|1|18|And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
Numbers|1|19|As Jehovah commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers|1|20|And the children of Reuben, Israel’s first-born, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|21|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.

Numbers|1|27|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

Numbers|1|32|Of the children of Joseph, {namely}, of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|33|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|1|34|Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|35|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.
Numbers|1|36|Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|37|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|1|38|Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|39|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.
Numbers|1|40|Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

Numbers|1|44|These are they that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers’ house.
Numbers|1|45|So all they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
Numbers|1|46|even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers|1|47|But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
Numbers|1|48|For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|1|49|Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel;
Numbers|1|50|but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
Numbers|1|51|And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|1|52|And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
Numbers|1|53|But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
Numbers|1|54|Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.
Numbers|2|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|2|2|The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers’ houses: over against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about.
Numbers|2|3|And those that encamp on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers|2|4|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.
Numbers|2|5|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers|2|6|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|7|{And} the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers|2|8|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|9|All that were numbered of the camp of Judah were a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts. They shall set forth first.
Numbers|2|10|On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers|2|11|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|12|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers|2|13|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.
Numbers|2|14|And the tribe of Gad: and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.
Numbers|2|15|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.
Numbers|2|16|All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth second.
Numbers|2|17|Then the tent of meeting shall set forward, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards.
Numbers|2|18|On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|2|19|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|20|And next unto him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers|2|21|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.
Numbers|2|22|And the tribe of Benjamin: and the prince of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.
Numbers|2|23|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|24|All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth third.
Numbers|2|25|On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

Numbers|2|27|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers|2|28|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|29|And the tribe of Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|2|30|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|31|All that were numbered of the camp of Dan were a hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall set forth hindmost by their standards.
Numbers|2|32|These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses: all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers|2|33|But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|2|34|Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.
Numbers|3|1|Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spake with Moses in mount Sinai.
Numbers|3|2|And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Numbers|3|3|These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.
Numbers|3|4|And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.
Numbers|3|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|6|Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.
Numbers|3|7|And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers|3|8|And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
Numbers|3|9|And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him on the behalf of the children of Israel.
Numbers|3|10|And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|3|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|12|And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
Numbers|3|13|for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah.
Numbers|3|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Numbers|3|15|Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.
Numbers|3|16|And Moses numbered them according to the word of Jehovah, as he was commanded.
Numbers|3|17|And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
Numbers|3|18|And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
Numbers|3|19|And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

Numbers|3|22|Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|3|23|The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the tabernacle westward.
Numbers|3|24|And the prince of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers|3|25|And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
Numbers|3|26|and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.
Numbers|3|27|And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.
Numbers|3|28|According to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
Numbers|3|29|The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle southward.
Numbers|3|30|And the prince of the fathers’ house of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Numbers|3|31|And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the screen, and all the service thereof.
Numbers|3|32|And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes of the Levites, {and have} the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.
Numbers|3|33|Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

Numbers|3|39|All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.
Numbers|3|40|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
Numbers|3|41|And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel:
Numbers|3|42|and Moses numbered, as Jehovah commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel.
Numbers|3|43|And all the first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.
Numbers|3|44|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|45|Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah.
Numbers|3|46|And for the redemption of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above {the number of} the Levites,
Numbers|3|47|thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs):
Numbers|3|48|and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.
Numbers|3|49|And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites;
Numbers|3|50|from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and five {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

Numbers|4|3|from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|4|This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, {about} the most holy things:
Numbers|4|5|when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it,
Numbers|4|6|and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.
Numbers|4|7|And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls and the cups wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall be thereon:

Numbers|4|15|And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp is set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|16|And the charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the continual meal-offering, and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, the sanctuary, and the furniture thereof.
Numbers|4|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|4|18|Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;
Numbers|4|19|but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;
Numbers|4|20|but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.
Numbers|4|21|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,

Numbers|4|24|This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:
Numbers|4|25|they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
Numbers|4|26|and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever shall be done with them: therein shall they serve.
Numbers|4|27|At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden.
Numbers|4|28|This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers|4|29|As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers’ houses;

Numbers|4|49|According to the commandment of Jehovah they were numbered by Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|5|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|2|Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead:
Numbers|5|3|both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.
Numbers|5|4|And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp; as Jehovah spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
Numbers|5|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|6|Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;
Numbers|5|7|then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.
Numbers|5|8|But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.
Numbers|5|9|And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.
Numbers|5|10|And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
Numbers|5|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|12|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
Numbers|5|13|and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act;
Numbers|5|14|and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
Numbers|5|15|then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and shall bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
Numbers|5|16|And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah:
Numbers|5|17|and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
Numbers|5|18|And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse.
Numbers|5|19|And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse.
Numbers|5|20|But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:
Numbers|5|21|then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;
Numbers|5|22|and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, and make thy body to swell, and thy thigh to fall away. And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
Numbers|5|23|And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:
Numbers|5|24|and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causeth the curse; and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her {and become} bitter.
Numbers|5|25|And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:
Numbers|5|26|and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
Numbers|5|27|And when he hath made her drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she be defiled, and have committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her {and become} bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
Numbers|5|28|And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
Numbers|5|29|This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;
Numbers|5|30|or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
Numbers|5|31|And the man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers|6|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|6|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,
Numbers|6|3|he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
Numbers|6|4|All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the kernels even to the husk.
Numbers|6|5|All the days of his vow of separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.
Numbers|6|6|All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.
Numbers|6|7|He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head.
Numbers|6|8|All the days of his separation he is holy unto Jehovah.
Numbers|6|9|And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
Numbers|6|10|And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|6|11|and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
Numbers|6|12|And he shall separate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.
Numbers|6|13|And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|6|14|and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
Numbers|6|15|and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.
Numbers|6|16|And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:
Numbers|6|17|and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|6|18|And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Numbers|6|19|And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he hath shaven {the head of} his separation;
Numbers|6|20|and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.
Numbers|6|21|This is the law of the Nazirite who voweth, {and of} his oblation unto Jehovah for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he voweth, so he must do after the law of his separation.
Numbers|6|22|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|6|23|Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: ye shall say unto them,
Numbers|6|24|Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:
Numbers|6|25|Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
Numbers|6|26|Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
Numbers|6|27|So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.
Numbers|7|1|And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;
Numbers|7|2|that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered:
Numbers|7|3|and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.
Numbers|7|4|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|7|5|Take it of them, that they may be {used} in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.
Numbers|7|6|And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
Numbers|7|7|Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
Numbers|7|8|and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers|7|9|But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them; they bare it upon their shoulders.
Numbers|7|10|And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their oblation before the altar.
Numbers|7|11|And Jehovah said unto Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.

Numbers|7|80|one golden spoon of ten {shekels}, full of incense;
Numbers|7|81|one young bullock, one ram, one he-lamb a year old, for a burnt-offering;
Numbers|7|82|one male of the goats for a sin-offering;
Numbers|7|83|and for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five he-lambs a year old: this was the oblation of Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|7|84|This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve silver platters, twelve silver bowls, twelve golden spoons;
Numbers|7|85|each silver platter {weighing} a hundred and thirty {shekels}, and each bowl seventy; all the silver of the vessels two thousand and four hundred {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary;
Numbers|7|86|the twelve golden spoons, full of incense, {weighing} ten {shekels} apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary; all the gold of the spoons a hundred and twenty {shekels};
Numbers|7|87|all the oxen for the burnt-offering twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the he-lambs a year old twelve, and their meal-offering; and the males of the goats for a sin-offering twelve;
Numbers|7|88|and all the oxen for the sacrifice of peace-offerings twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he-goats sixty, the he-lambs a year old sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it was anointed.
Numbers|7|89|And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spake unto him.
Numbers|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|2|Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.
Numbers|8|3|And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof {so as to give light} in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|8|4|And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, {and} unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which Jehovah had showed Moses, so he made the candlestick.
Numbers|8|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|6|Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
Numbers|8|7|And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
Numbers|8|8|Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.
Numbers|8|9|And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:
Numbers|8|10|and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:
Numbers|8|11|and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.
Numbers|8|12|And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers|8|13|And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto Jehovah.
Numbers|8|14|Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.
Numbers|8|15|And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.
Numbers|8|16|For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
Numbers|8|17|For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
Numbers|8|18|And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.
Numbers|8|19|And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.
Numbers|8|20|Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.
Numbers|8|21|And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Numbers|8|22|And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
Numbers|8|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|24|This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|8|25|and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,
Numbers|8|26|but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.
Numbers|9|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers|9|2|Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.
Numbers|9|3|In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.
Numbers|9|4|And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
Numbers|9|5|And they kept the passover in the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
Numbers|9|6|And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
Numbers|9|7|and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
Numbers|9|8|And Moses said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.
Numbers|9|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|9|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah.
Numbers|9|11|In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:
Numbers|9|12|they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.
Numbers|9|13|But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
Numbers|9|14|And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.
Numbers|9|15|And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
Numbers|9|16|So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers|9|17|And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
Numbers|9|18|At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
Numbers|9|19|And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.
Numbers|9|20|And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.
Numbers|9|21|And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or {if it continued} by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers|9|22|Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers|9|23|At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
Numbers|10|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|10|2|Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
Numbers|10|3|And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|10|4|And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
Numbers|10|5|And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
Numbers|10|6|And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
Numbers|10|7|But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
Numbers|10|8|And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Numbers|10|9|And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
Numbers|10|10|Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
Numbers|10|11|And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
Numbers|10|12|And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers|10|13|And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
Numbers|10|14|And in the first {place} the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers|10|15|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers|10|16|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers|10|17|And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward.
Numbers|10|18|And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers|10|19|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers|10|20|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
Numbers|10|21|And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and {the others} did set up the tabernacle against their coming.
Numbers|10|22|And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|10|23|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers|10|24|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
Numbers|10|25|And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers|10|26|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers|10|27|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|10|28|Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts; and they set forward.
Numbers|10|29|And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel.
Numbers|10|30|And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
Numbers|10|31|And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
Numbers|10|32|And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever Jehovah shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.
Numbers|10|33|And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.
Numbers|10|34|And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.
Numbers|10|35|And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
Numbers|10|36|And when it rested, he said, Return, O Jehovah, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.
Numbers|11|1|And the people were as murmurers, {speaking} evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.
Numbers|11|2|And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.
Numbers|11|3|And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.
Numbers|11|4|And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
Numbers|11|5|We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
Numbers|11|6|but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.
Numbers|11|7|And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.
Numbers|11|8|The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
Numbers|11|9|And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
Numbers|11|10|And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.
Numbers|11|11|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
Numbers|11|12|Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
Numbers|11|13|Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
Numbers|11|14|I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
Numbers|11|15|And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
Numbers|11|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.
Numbers|11|17|And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
Numbers|11|18|And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
Numbers|11|19|Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
Numbers|11|20|but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
Numbers|11|21|And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
Numbers|11|22|Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
Numbers|11|23|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah’s hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
Numbers|11|24|And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.
Numbers|11|25|And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
Numbers|11|26|But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers|11|27|And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
Numbers|11|28|And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
Numbers|11|29|And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah’s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!
Numbers|11|30|And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
Numbers|11|31|And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
Numbers|11|32|And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
Numbers|11|33|While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.
Numbers|11|34|And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers|11|35|From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
Numbers|12|1|And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
Numbers|12|2|And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.
Numbers|12|3|Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.
Numbers|12|4|And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.
Numbers|12|5|And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
Numbers|12|6|And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
Numbers|12|7|My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
Numbers|12|8|with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
Numbers|12|9|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers|12|10|And the cloud removed from over the Tent; and, behold, Miriam was leprous, as {white as} snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
Numbers|12|11|And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
Numbers|12|12|Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.
Numbers|12|13|And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.
Numbers|12|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.
Numbers|12|15|And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
Numbers|12|16|And afterward the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|13|2|Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.
Numbers|13|3|And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.
Numbers|13|4|And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
Numbers|13|5|Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
Numbers|13|6|Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers|13|7|Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
Numbers|13|8|Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
Numbers|13|9|Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
Numbers|13|10|Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
Numbers|13|11|Of the tribe of Joseph, {namely}, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
Numbers|13|12|Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
Numbers|13|13|Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
Numbers|13|14|Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
Numbers|13|15|Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers|13|16|These are the names of the men that Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
Numbers|13|17|And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:
Numbers|13|18|and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
Numbers|13|19|and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
Numbers|13|20|and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.
Numbers|13|21|So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
Numbers|13|22|And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers|13|23|And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; {they brought} also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
Numbers|13|24|That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
Numbers|13|25|And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
Numbers|13|26|And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers|13|27|And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Numbers|13|28|Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, {and} very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
Numbers|13|29|Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.
Numbers|13|30|And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
Numbers|13|31|But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
Numbers|13|32|And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
Numbers|13|33|And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
Numbers|14|1|And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
Numbers|14|2|And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers|14|3|And wherefore doth Jehovah bring us unto this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
Numbers|14|4|And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
Numbers|14|5|Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers|14|6|And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:
Numbers|14|7|and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
Numbers|14|8|If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
Numbers|14|9|Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.
Numbers|14|10|But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the children of Israel.
Numbers|14|11|And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?
Numbers|14|12|I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
Numbers|14|13|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;
Numbers|14|14|and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
Numbers|14|15|Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
Numbers|14|16|Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
Numbers|14|17|And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
Numbers|14|18|Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; and that will by no means clear {the guilty}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Numbers|14|19|Pardon, I pray thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy lovingkindness, and according as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
Numbers|14|20|And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
Numbers|14|21|but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;
Numbers|14|22|because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
Numbers|14|23|surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:
Numbers|14|24|but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
Numbers|14|25|Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: to-morrow turn ye, and get you into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Numbers|14|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|14|27|How long {shall I bear} with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
Numbers|14|28|Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
Numbers|14|29|your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,
Numbers|14|30|surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|14|31|But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.
Numbers|14|32|But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
Numbers|14|33|And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.
Numbers|14|34|After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.
Numbers|14|35|I, Jehovah, have spoken, surely this will I do unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
Numbers|14|36|And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
Numbers|14|37|even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.
Numbers|14|38|But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men that went to spy out the land.
Numbers|14|39|And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers|14|40|And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.
Numbers|14|41|And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?
Numbers|14|42|Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.
Numbers|14|43|For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.
Numbers|14|44|But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
Numbers|14|45|Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who dwelt in that mountain, and smote them and beat them down, even unto Hormah.
Numbers|15|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
Numbers|15|3|and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;
Numbers|15|4|then shall he that offereth his oblation offer unto Jehovah a meal-offering of a tenth part {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|5|and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
Numbers|15|6|Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meal-offering two tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|7|and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|8|And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;
Numbers|15|9|then shall he offer with the bullock a meal-offering of three tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|10|and thou shalt offer for the drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|11|Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.
Numbers|15|12|According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
Numbers|15|13|All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|14|And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.
Numbers|15|15|For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth {with you}, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.
Numbers|15|16|One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
Numbers|15|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|18|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
Numbers|15|19|then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|20|Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
Numbers|15|21|Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.
Numbers|15|22|And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,
Numbers|15|23|even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
Numbers|15|24|then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.
Numbers|15|25|And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:
Numbers|15|26|and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.
Numbers|15|27|And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.
Numbers|15|28|And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
Numbers|15|29|Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
Numbers|15|30|But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Numbers|15|31|Because he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
Numbers|15|32|And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.
Numbers|15|33|And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
Numbers|15|34|And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers|15|35|And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
Numbers|15|36|And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|15|37|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|38|Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:
Numbers|15|39|and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;
Numbers|15|40|that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
Numbers|15|41|I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.
Numbers|16|1|Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took {men}:
Numbers|16|2|and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;
Numbers|16|3|and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?
Numbers|16|4|And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
Numbers|16|5|and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.
Numbers|16|6|This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
Numbers|16|7|and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before Jehovah to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he {shall be} holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
Numbers|16|8|And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:
Numbers|16|9|{seemeth it but} a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;
Numbers|16|10|and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?
Numbers|16|11|Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?
Numbers|16|12|And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:
Numbers|16|13|is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?
Numbers|16|14|Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
Numbers|16|15|And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
Numbers|16|16|And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:
Numbers|16|17|and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.
Numbers|16|18|And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers|16|19|And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the congregation.
Numbers|16|20|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|16|21|Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
Numbers|16|22|And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
Numbers|16|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|24|Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
Numbers|16|25|And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers|16|26|And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
Numbers|16|27|So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
Numbers|16|28|And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah hath sent me to do all these works; for {I have} not {done them} of mine own mind.
Numbers|16|29|If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.
Numbers|16|30|But if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised Jehovah.
Numbers|16|31|And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;
Numbers|16|32|and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
Numbers|16|33|So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.
Numbers|16|34|And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
Numbers|16|35|And fire came forth from Jehovah, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.
Numbers|16|36|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|37|Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,
Numbers|16|38|even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
Numbers|16|39|And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
Numbers|16|40|to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to burn incense before Jehovah; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as Jehovah spake unto him by Moses.
Numbers|16|41|But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.
Numbers|16|42|And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
Numbers|16|43|And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|16|44|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|45|Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
Numbers|16|46|And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.
Numbers|16|47|And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
Numbers|16|48|And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers|16|49|Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
Numbers|16|50|And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.
Numbers|17|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|17|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon his rod.
Numbers|17|3|And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
Numbers|17|4|And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
Numbers|17|5|And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
Numbers|17|6|And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
Numbers|17|7|And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.
Numbers|17|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.
Numbers|17|9|And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
Numbers|17|10|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.
Numbers|17|11|Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
Numbers|17|12|And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
Numbers|17|13|Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?
Numbers|18|1|And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’ house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
Numbers|18|2|And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
Numbers|18|3|And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.
Numbers|18|4|And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
Numbers|18|5|And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.
Numbers|18|6|And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|7|And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|18|8|And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.
Numbers|18|9|This shall be thine of the most holy things, {reserved} from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
Numbers|18|10|As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.
Numbers|18|11|And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers|18|12|All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.
Numbers|18|13|The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers|18|14|Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.
Numbers|18|15|Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
Numbers|18|16|And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
Numbers|18|17|But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|18|18|And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
Numbers|18|19|All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
Numbers|18|20|And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
Numbers|18|21|And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|22|And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
Numbers|18|23|But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers|18|24|For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers|18|25|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|18|26|Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.
Numbers|18|27|And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
Numbers|18|28|Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
Numbers|18|29|Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
Numbers|18|30|Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
Numbers|18|31|And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|32|And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
Numbers|19|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|19|2|This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, {and} upon which never came yoke.
Numbers|19|3|And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
Numbers|19|4|and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers|19|5|And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
Numbers|19|6|and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
Numbers|19|7|Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers|19|8|And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers|19|9|And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.
Numbers|19|10|And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
Numbers|19|11|He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
Numbers|19|12|the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
Numbers|19|13|Whosoever toucheth a dead person, the body of a man that hath died, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
Numbers|19|14|This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers|19|15|And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
Numbers|19|16|And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers|19|17|And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
Numbers|19|18|and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
Numbers|19|19|and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
Numbers|19|20|But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
Numbers|19|21|And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.
Numbers|19|22|And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
Numbers|20|1|And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
Numbers|20|2|And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers|20|3|And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!
Numbers|20|4|And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?
Numbers|20|5|And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
Numbers|20|6|And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.
Numbers|20|7|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|20|8|Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.
Numbers|20|9|And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.
Numbers|20|10|And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?
Numbers|20|11|And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
Numbers|20|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
Numbers|20|13|These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he was sanctified in them.
Numbers|20|14|And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
Numbers|20|15|how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:
Numbers|20|16|and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
Numbers|20|17|Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers|20|18|And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.
Numbers|20|19|And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without {doing} anything {else}, pass through on my feet.
Numbers|20|20|And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
Numbers|20|21|Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
Numbers|20|22|And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.
Numbers|20|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
Numbers|20|24|Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers|20|25|Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;
Numbers|20|26|and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered {unto his people}, and shall die there.
Numbers|20|27|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers|20|28|And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
Numbers|20|29|And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
Numbers|21|1|And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
Numbers|21|2|And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Numbers|21|3|And Jehovah hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.
Numbers|21|4|And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
Numbers|21|5|And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
Numbers|21|6|And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
Numbers|21|7|And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers|21|8|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.
Numbers|21|9|And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived.
Numbers|21|10|And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.
Numbers|21|11|And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
Numbers|21|12|From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
Numbers|21|13|From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers|21|14|Wherefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Jehovah,             Vaheb in Suphah,                   And the valleys of the Arnon,
Numbers|21|15|And the slope of the valleys                   That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar,                   And leaneth upon the border of Moab.
Numbers|21|16|And from thence {they journeyed} to Beer: that is the well whereof Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
Numbers|21|17|Then sang Israel this song:             Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
Numbers|21|18|The well, which the princes digged,                   Which the nobles of the people delved,                   With the sceptre, {and} with their staves.            And from the wilderness {they journeyed} to Mattanah;
Numbers|21|19|and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
Numbers|21|20|and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh down upon the desert.
Numbers|21|21|And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers|21|22|Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers|21|23|And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.
Numbers|21|24|And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
Numbers|21|25|And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.
Numbers|21|26|For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.
Numbers|21|27|Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say,             Come ye to Heshbon;                   Let the city of Sihon be built and established:
Numbers|21|28|For a fire is gone out of Heshbon,                   A flame from the city of Sihon:                   It hath devoured Ar of Moab,                   The lords of the high places of the Arnon.
Numbers|21|29|Woe to thee, Moab!                   Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh:                   He hath given his sons as fugitives,                   And his daughters into captivity,                   Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
Numbers|21|30|We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon,                   And we have laid waste even unto Nophah,                   Which {reacheth} unto Medeba.
Numbers|21|31|Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers|21|32|And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
Numbers|21|33|And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
Numbers|21|34|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
Numbers|21|35|So they smote him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.
Numbers|22|1|And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|22|2|And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers|22|3|And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
Numbers|22|4|And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
Numbers|22|5|And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
Numbers|22|6|Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
Numbers|22|7|And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
Numbers|22|8|And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
Numbers|22|9|And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
Numbers|22|10|And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, {saying},
Numbers|22|11|Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.
Numbers|22|12|And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.
Numbers|22|13|And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
Numbers|22|14|And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
Numbers|22|15|And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
Numbers|22|16|And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
Numbers|22|17|for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
Numbers|22|18|And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
Numbers|22|19|Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more.
Numbers|22|20|And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.
Numbers|22|21|And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers|22|22|And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
Numbers|22|23|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
Numbers|22|24|Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
Numbers|22|25|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
Numbers|22|26|And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
Numbers|22|27|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
Numbers|22|28|And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
Numbers|22|29|And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.
Numbers|22|30|And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.
Numbers|22|31|Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
Numbers|22|32|And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:
Numbers|22|33|and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.
Numbers|22|34|And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
Numbers|22|35|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
Numbers|22|36|And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
Numbers|22|37|And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
Numbers|22|38|And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
Numbers|22|39|And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.
Numbers|22|40|And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
Numbers|22|41|And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.
Numbers|23|1|And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers|23|2|And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers|23|3|And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.
Numbers|23|4|And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers|23|5|And Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
Numbers|23|6|And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
Numbers|23|7|And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.
Numbers|23|8|How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?
Numbers|23|9|For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him:      Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
Numbers|23|10|Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!
Numbers|23|11|And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
Numbers|23|12|And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah putteth in my mouth?
Numbers|23|13|And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
Numbers|23|14|And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers|23|15|And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet {Jehovah} yonder.
Numbers|23|16|And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
Numbers|23|17|And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Numbers|23|18|And he took up his parable, and said,             Rise up, Balak, and hear;                   Hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
Numbers|23|19|God is not a man, that he should lie,                   Neither the son of man, that he should repent:                   Hath he said, and will he not do it?                   Or hath he spoken, and will he not make it good?
Numbers|23|20|Behold, I have received {commandment} to bless:                   And he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
Numbers|23|21|He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob;                   Neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel:                   Jehovah his God is with him,                   And the shout of a king is among them.
Numbers|23|22|God bringeth them forth out of Egypt;                   He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox.
Numbers|23|23|Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;                   Neither is there any divination with Israel:                   Now shalt it be said of Jacob and of Israel,                   What hath God wrought!
Numbers|23|24|Behold, the people riseth up as a lioness,                   And as a lion doth he lift himself up:                   He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,                   And drink the blood of the slain.
Numbers|23|25|And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
Numbers|23|26|But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?
Numbers|23|27|And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
Numbers|23|28|And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.
Numbers|23|29|And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers|23|30|And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers|24|1|And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers|24|2|And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
Numbers|24|3|And he took up his parable, and said,             Balaam the son of Beor saith,                   And the man whose eye was closed saith;
Numbers|24|4|He saith, who heareth the words of God,                   Who seeth the vision of the Almighty,                   Falling down, and having his eyes open:
Numbers|24|5|How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,                   Thy tabernacles, O Israel!
Numbers|24|6|As valleys are they spread forth,                   As gardens by the river-side,                   As lign-aloes which Jehovah hath planted,                   As cedar-trees beside the waters.
Numbers|24|7|Water shall flow from his buckets,                   And his seed shall be in many waters,                   And his king shall be higher than Agag,                   And his kingdom shall be exalted.
Numbers|24|8|God bringeth him forth out of Egypt;                   He hath as it were the strength of the wild-ox:                   He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,                   And shall break their bones in pieces,                   And smite {them} through with his arrows.
Numbers|24|9|He couched, he lay down as a lion,                   And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?                   Blessed be every one that blesseth thee,                   And cursed be every one that curseth thee.
Numbers|24|10|And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
Numbers|24|11|Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honor.
Numbers|24|12|And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,
Numbers|24|13|If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?
Numbers|24|14|And now, behold, I go unto my people: come, {and} I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
Numbers|24|15|And he took up his parable, and said,             Balaam the son of Beor saith,                   And the man whose eye was closed saith;
Numbers|24|16|He saith, who heareth the words of God,                   And knoweth the knowledge of the Most High,                   Who seeth the vision of the Almighty,                   Falling down, and having his eyes open:
Numbers|24|17|I see him, but not now;                   I behold him, but not nigh:                   There shall come forth a star out of Jacob,                   And a sceptre shall rise out of Israel,                   And shall smite through the corners of Moab,                   And break down all the sons of tumult.
Numbers|24|18|And Edom shall be a possession,                   Seir also shall be a possession, {who were} his enemies;                   While Israel doeth valiantly.
Numbers|24|19|And out of Jacob shall one have dominion,                   And shall destroy the remnant from the city.
Numbers|24|20|And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,             Amalek was the first of the nations;                   But his latter end shall come to destruction.
Numbers|24|21|And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,             Strong is thy dwelling-place,                   And thy nest is set in the rock.
Numbers|24|22|Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,                   Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
Numbers|24|23|And he took up his parable, and said,             Alas, who shall live when God doeth this?
Numbers|24|24|But ships {shall come} from the coast of Kittim,                   And they shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber;                   And he also shall come to destruction.
Numbers|24|25|And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
Numbers|25|1|And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:
Numbers|25|2|for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers|25|3|And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.
Numbers|25|4|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.
Numbers|25|5|And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that have joined themselves unto Baal-peor.
Numbers|25|6|And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|25|7|And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;
Numbers|25|8|and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
Numbers|25|9|And those that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand.
Numbers|25|10|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|25|11|Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
Numbers|25|12|Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
Numbers|25|13|and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
Numbers|25|14|Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.
Numbers|25|15|And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.
Numbers|25|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|25|17|Vex the Midianites, and smite them;
Numbers|25|18|for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.
Numbers|26|1|And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
Numbers|26|2|Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.
Numbers|26|3|And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers|26|4|{Take the sum of the people}, from twenty years old and upward; as Jehovah commanded Moses and the children of Israel, that came forth out of the land of Egypt.

Numbers|26|10|and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign.

Numbers|26|55|Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
Numbers|26|56|According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.

Numbers|26|60|And unto Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers|26|61|And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.
Numbers|26|62|And they that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
Numbers|26|63|These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|26|64|But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers|26|65|For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|27|1|Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
Numbers|27|2|And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,
Numbers|27|3|Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.
Numbers|27|4|Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.
Numbers|27|5|And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.
Numbers|27|6|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|27|7|The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
Numbers|27|8|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
Numbers|27|9|And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
Numbers|27|10|And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
Numbers|27|11|And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute {and} ordinance, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|27|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
Numbers|27|13|And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;
Numbers|27|14|because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
Numbers|27|15|And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,
Numbers|27|16|Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
Numbers|27|17|who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
Numbers|27|18|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;
Numbers|27|19|and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
Numbers|27|20|And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.
Numbers|27|21|And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
Numbers|27|22|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
Numbers|27|23|and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses.
Numbers|28|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|28|2|Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
Numbers|28|3|And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|4|The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
Numbers|28|5|and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
Numbers|28|6|It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|7|And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|8|And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|9|And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:
Numbers|28|10|this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|11|And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|28|12|and three tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;
Numbers|28|13|and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|14|And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers|28|15|And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|16|And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah’s passover.
Numbers|28|17|And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
Numbers|28|18|In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;

Numbers|28|22|and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
Numbers|28|23|Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|24|After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|25|And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Numbers|28|26|Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your {feast of} weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;

Numbers|29|7|And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work;
Numbers|29|8|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;
Numbers|29|9|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,

Numbers|29|40|And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|30|1|And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded.
Numbers|30|2|When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
Numbers|30|3|Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth,
Numbers|30|4|and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|5|But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
Numbers|30|6|And if she be {married} to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul,
Numbers|30|7|and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|8|But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her.
Numbers|30|9|But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, {even} everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.
Numbers|30|10|And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
Numbers|30|11|and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|12|But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.
Numbers|30|13|Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
Numbers|30|14|But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
Numbers|30|15|But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers|30|16|These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.
Numbers|31|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|31|2|Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
Numbers|31|3|And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midian.
Numbers|31|4|Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
Numbers|31|5|So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
Numbers|31|6|And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
Numbers|31|7|And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.
Numbers|31|8|And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
Numbers|31|9|And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.
Numbers|31|10|And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
Numbers|31|11|And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
Numbers|31|12|And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|31|13|And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
Numbers|31|14|And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
Numbers|31|15|And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
Numbers|31|16|Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah.
Numbers|31|17|Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
Numbers|31|18|But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
Numbers|31|19|And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.
Numbers|31|20|And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ {hair}, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.
Numbers|31|21|And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:
Numbers|31|22|howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Numbers|31|23|everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.
Numbers|31|24|And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
Numbers|31|25|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|31|26|Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the congregation;
Numbers|31|27|and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.
Numbers|31|28|And levy a tribute unto Jehovah of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, {both} of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:
Numbers|31|29|take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah’s heave-offering.
Numbers|31|30|And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, {even} of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.
Numbers|31|31|And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|31|32|Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
Numbers|31|33|and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,
Numbers|31|34|and threescore and one thousand asses,
Numbers|31|35|and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.
Numbers|31|36|And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:
Numbers|31|37|and Jehovah’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
Numbers|31|38|And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and twelve.
Numbers|31|39|And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and one.
Numbers|31|40|And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovah’s tribute was thirty and two persons.
Numbers|31|41|And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah’s heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|31|42|And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred
Numbers|31|43|(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
Numbers|31|44|and thirty and six thousand oxen,
Numbers|31|45|and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,
Numbers|31|46|and sixteen thousand persons),
Numbers|31|47|even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|31|48|And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;
Numbers|31|49|and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
Numbers|31|50|And we have brought Jehovah’s oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.
Numbers|31|51|And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
Numbers|31|52|And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
Numbers|31|53|({For} the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
Numbers|31|54|And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.
Numbers|32|1|Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
Numbers|32|2|the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
Numbers|32|3|Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
Numbers|32|4|the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle.
Numbers|32|5|And they said, If we have found favor in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession; bring us not over the Jordan.
Numbers|32|6|And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?
Numbers|32|7|And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?
Numbers|32|8|Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers|32|9|For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.
Numbers|32|10|And Jehovah’s anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,
Numbers|32|11|Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
Numbers|32|12|save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah.
Numbers|32|13|And Jehovah’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed.
Numbers|32|14|And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.
Numbers|32|15|For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye will destroy all this people.
Numbers|32|16|And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
Numbers|32|17|but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers|32|18|We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
Numbers|32|19|For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.
Numbers|32|20|And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,
Numbers|32|21|and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
Numbers|32|22|and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah.
Numbers|32|23|But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers|32|24|Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
Numbers|32|25|And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
Numbers|32|26|Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
Numbers|32|27|but thy servants will pass over, every man that is armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord saith.
Numbers|32|28|So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel.
Numbers|32|29|And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
Numbers|32|30|but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
Numbers|32|31|And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
Numbers|32|32|We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance {shall remain} with us beyond the Jordan.
Numbers|32|33|And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities thereof with {their} borders, even the cities of the land round about.
Numbers|32|34|And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
Numbers|32|35|and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
Numbers|32|36|and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
Numbers|32|37|And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
Numbers|32|38|and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
Numbers|32|39|And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.
Numbers|32|40|And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
Numbers|32|41|And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers|32|42|And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
Numbers|33|1|These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers|33|2|And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
Numbers|33|3|And they journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,
Numbers|33|4|while the Egyptians were burying all their first-born, whom Jehovah had smitten among them: upon their gods also Jehovah executed judgments.
Numbers|33|5|And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.
Numbers|33|6|And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
Numbers|33|7|And they journeyed from Etham, and turned back unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.
Numbers|33|8|And they journeyed from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and they went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
Numbers|33|9|And they journeyed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there.
Numbers|33|10|And they journeyed from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea.
Numbers|33|11|And they journeyed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
Numbers|33|12|And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
Numbers|33|13|And they journeyed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
Numbers|33|14|And they journeyed from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.
Numbers|33|15|And they journeyed from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers|33|16|And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth-hattaavah.
Numbers|33|17|And they journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.
Numbers|33|18|And they journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.
Numbers|33|19|And they journeyed from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon-perez.
Numbers|33|20|And they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, and encamped in Libnah.
Numbers|33|21|And they journeyed from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah.
Numbers|33|22|And they journeyed from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.
Numbers|33|23|And they journeyed from Kehelathah, and encamped in mount Shepher.
Numbers|33|24|And they journeyed from mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.
Numbers|33|25|And they journeyed from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.
Numbers|33|26|And they journeyed from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.
Numbers|33|27|And they journeyed from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.
Numbers|33|28|And they journeyed from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.
Numbers|33|29|And they journeyed from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.
Numbers|33|30|And they journeyed from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.
Numbers|33|31|And they journeyed from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-jaakan.
Numbers|33|32|And they journeyed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped in Hor-haggidgad.
Numbers|33|33|And they journeyed from Hor-haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.
Numbers|33|34|And they journeyed from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.
Numbers|33|35|And they journeyed from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion-geber.
Numbers|33|36|And they journeyed from Ezion-geber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin (the same is Kadesh).
Numbers|33|37|And they journeyed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
Numbers|33|38|And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
Numbers|33|39|And Aaron was a hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.
Numbers|33|40|And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
Numbers|33|41|And they journeyed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
Numbers|33|42|And they journeyed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
Numbers|33|43|And they journeyed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
Numbers|33|44|And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped in Iye-abarim, in the border of Moab.
Numbers|33|45|And they journeyed from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon-gad.
Numbers|33|46|And they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.
Numbers|33|47|And they journeyed from Almon-diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
Numbers|33|48|And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|33|49|And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
Numbers|33|50|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers|33|51|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers|33|52|then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured {stones}, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:
Numbers|33|53|and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.
Numbers|33|54|And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
Numbers|33|55|But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
Numbers|33|56|And it shall come to pass, that, as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you.
Numbers|34|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|34|2|Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof),
Numbers|34|3|then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;
Numbers|34|4|and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;
Numbers|34|5|and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the sea.
Numbers|34|6|And for the western border, ye shall have the great sea and the border {thereof}: this shall be your west border.
Numbers|34|7|And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;
Numbers|34|8|from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;
Numbers|34|9|and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.
Numbers|34|10|And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;
Numbers|34|11|and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
Numbers|34|12|and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.
Numbers|34|13|And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
Numbers|34|14|for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’ houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:
Numbers|34|15|the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
Numbers|34|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|34|17|These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|34|18|And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.
Numbers|34|19|And these are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers|34|20|And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|34|21|Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
Numbers|34|22|And of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.
Numbers|34|23|Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
Numbers|34|24|And of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
Numbers|34|25|And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
Numbers|34|26|And of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
Numbers|34|27|And of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
Numbers|34|28|And of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|34|29|These are they whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
Numbers|35|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers|35|2|Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.
Numbers|35|3|And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.
Numbers|35|4|And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
Numbers|35|5|And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
Numbers|35|6|And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.
Numbers|35|7|All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them {shall ye give} with their suburbs.
Numbers|35|8|And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.
Numbers|35|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|35|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers|35|11|then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|12|And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
Numbers|35|13|And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|14|Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|15|For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|16|But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|17|And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|18|Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|19|The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
Numbers|35|20|And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
Numbers|35|21|or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.
Numbers|35|22|But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,
Numbers|35|23|or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;
Numbers|35|24|then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;
Numbers|35|25|and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers|35|26|But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,
Numbers|35|27|and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,
Numbers|35|28|because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
Numbers|35|29|And these things shall be for a statute {and} ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers|35|30|Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
Numbers|35|31|Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|32|And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
Numbers|35|33|So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
Numbers|35|34|And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.
Numbers|36|1|And the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the children of Israel:
Numbers|36|2|and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
Numbers|36|3|And if they be married to any of the sons of the {other} tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
Numbers|36|4|And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
Numbers|36|5|And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.
Numbers|36|6|This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.
Numbers|36|7|So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers|36|8|And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers|36|9|So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.
Numbers|36|10|Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
Numbers|36|11|for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons.
Numbers|36|12|They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
Numbers|36|13|These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Exodus|1|1|Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):
Exodus|1|2|Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Exodus|1|3|Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exodus|1|4|Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus|1|5|And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exodus|1|6|And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
Exodus|1|7|And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Exodus|1|8|Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Exodus|1|9|And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Exodus|1|10|come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
Exodus|1|11|Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus|1|12|But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
Exodus|1|13|And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:
Exodus|1|14|and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.
Exodus|1|15|And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
Exodus|1|16|and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
Exodus|1|17|But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.
Exodus|1|18|And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?
Exodus|1|19|And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.
Exodus|1|20|And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
Exodus|1|21|And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.
Exodus|1|22|And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
Exodus|2|1|And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
Exodus|2|2|And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
Exodus|2|3|And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
Exodus|2|4|And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
Exodus|2|5|And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
Exodus|2|6|And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
Exodus|2|7|Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
Exodus|2|8|And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.
Exodus|2|9|And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
Exodus|2|10|And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
Exodus|2|11|And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
Exodus|2|12|And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
Exodus|2|13|And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
Exodus|2|14|And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
Exodus|2|15|Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
Exodus|2|16|Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus|2|17|And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
Exodus|2|18|And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?
Exodus|2|19|And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
Exodus|2|20|And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
Exodus|2|21|And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus|2|22|And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
Exodus|2|23|And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
Exodus|2|24|And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
Exodus|2|25|And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge {of them}.
Exodus|3|1|Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.
Exodus|3|2|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
Exodus|3|3|And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Exodus|3|4|And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
Exodus|3|5|And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Exodus|3|6|Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
Exodus|3|7|And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
Exodus|3|8|and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus|3|9|And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
Exodus|3|10|Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus|3|11|And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
Exodus|3|12|And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
Exodus|3|13|And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?
Exodus|3|14|And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
Exodus|3|15|And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
Exodus|3|16|Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and {seen} that which is done to you in Egypt:
Exodus|3|17|and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
Exodus|3|18|And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
Exodus|3|19|And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
Exodus|3|20|And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
Exodus|3|21|And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
Exodus|3|22|But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.
Exodus|4|1|And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee.
Exodus|4|2|And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
Exodus|4|3|And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
Exodus|4|4|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)
Exodus|4|5|That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
Exodus|4|6|And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as {white as} snow.
Exodus|4|7|And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his {other} flesh.)
Exodus|4|8|And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
Exodus|4|9|And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
Exodus|4|10|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
Exodus|4|11|And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh {a man} dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
Exodus|4|12|Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.
Exodus|4|13|And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
Exodus|4|14|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
Exodus|4|15|And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
Exodus|4|16|And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.
Exodus|4|17|And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
Exodus|4|18|And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
Exodus|4|19|And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.
Exodus|4|20|And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
Exodus|4|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
Exodus|4|22|And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born:
Exodus|4|23|and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.
Exodus|4|24|And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.
Exodus|4|25|Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.
Exodus|4|26|So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood {art thou}, because of the circumcision.
Exodus|4|27|And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.
Exodus|4|28|And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.
Exodus|4|29|And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
Exodus|4|30|and Aaron spake all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
Exodus|4|31|And the people believed: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
Exodus|5|1|And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
Exodus|5|2|And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.
Exodus|5|3|And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
Exodus|5|4|And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
Exodus|5|5|And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
Exodus|5|6|And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
Exodus|5|7|Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus|5|8|And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Exodus|5|9|Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.
Exodus|5|10|And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
Exodus|5|11|Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.
Exodus|5|12|So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus|5|13|And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, {your} daily tasks, as when there was straw.
Exodus|5|14|And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?
Exodus|5|15|Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
Exodus|5|16|There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.
Exodus|5|17|But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
Exodus|5|18|Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
Exodus|5|19|And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, {your} daily tasks.
Exodus|5|20|And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
Exodus|5|21|and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
Exodus|5|22|And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
Exodus|5|23|For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
Exodus|6|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
Exodus|6|2|And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:
Exodus|6|3|and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.
Exodus|6|4|And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
Exodus|6|5|And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
Exodus|6|6|Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
Exodus|6|7|and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exodus|6|8|And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.
Exodus|6|9|And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
Exodus|6|10|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|6|11|Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus|6|12|And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?
Exodus|6|13|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|6|14|These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.

Exodus|6|25|And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the Levites according to their families.
Exodus|6|26|These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.
Exodus|6|27|These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
Exodus|6|28|And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
Exodus|6|29|that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.
Exodus|6|30|And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
Exodus|7|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
Exodus|7|2|Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus|7|3|And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
