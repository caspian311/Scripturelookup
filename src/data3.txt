Isaiah|28|13|Therefore shall the word of Jehovah be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
Isaiah|28|14|Wherefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem:
Isaiah|28|15|Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
Isaiah|28|16|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner -{stone} of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not be in haste.
Isaiah|28|17|And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
Isaiah|28|18|And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
Isaiah|28|19|As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.
Isaiah|28|20|For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
Isaiah|28|21|For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
Isaiah|28|22|Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.
Isaiah|28|23|Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
Isaiah|28|24|Doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually? doth he {continually} open and harrow his ground?
Isaiah|28|25|When he hath levelled the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border thereof?
Isaiah|28|26|For his God doth instruct him aright, {and} doth teach him.
Isaiah|28|27|For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp {threshing} instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
Isaiah|28|28|Bread {grain} is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.
Isaiah|28|29|This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
Isaiah|29|1|Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:
Isaiah|29|2|then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.
Isaiah|29|3|And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.
Isaiah|29|4|And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
Isaiah|29|5|But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.
Isaiah|29|6|She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
Isaiah|29|7|And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
Isaiah|29|8|And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
Isaiah|29|9|Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
Isaiah|29|10|For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.
Isaiah|29|11|And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:
Isaiah|29|12|and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.
Isaiah|29|13|And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh {unto me}, and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught {them};
Isaiah|29|14|therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
Isaiah|29|15|Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
Isaiah|29|16|Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?
Isaiah|29|17|Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
Isaiah|29|18|And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
Isaiah|29|19|The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|29|20|For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;
Isaiah|29|21|that make a man an offender in {his} cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.
Isaiah|29|22|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
Isaiah|29|23|But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.
Isaiah|29|24|They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.
Isaiah|30|1|Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,
Isaiah|30|2|that set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah|30|3|Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
Isaiah|30|4|For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors are come to Hanes.
Isaiah|30|5|They shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
Isaiah|30|6|The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit {them}.
Isaiah|30|7|For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.
Isaiah|30|8|Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
Isaiah|30|9|For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;
Isaiah|30|10|that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,
Isaiah|30|11|get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
Isaiah|30|12|Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;
Isaiah|30|13|therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.
Isaiah|30|14|And he shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.
Isaiah|30|15|For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:
Isaiah|30|16|but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
Isaiah|30|17|One thousand {shall flee} at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
Isaiah|30|18|And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.
Isaiah|30|19|For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.
Isaiah|30|20|And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;
Isaiah|30|21|and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Isaiah|30|22|And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
Isaiah|30|23|And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;
Isaiah|30|24|the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
Isaiah|30|25|And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks {and} streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Isaiah|30|26|Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
Isaiah|30|27|Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;
Isaiah|30|28|and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err {shall be} in the jaws of the peoples.
Isaiah|30|29|Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah|30|30|And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of {his} anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.
Isaiah|30|31|For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod will he smite {him}.
Isaiah|30|32|And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with {the sound of} tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing {of his arm} will he fight with them.
Isaiah|30|33|For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
Isaiah|31|1|Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!
Isaiah|31|2|Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
Isaiah|31|3|Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.
Isaiah|31|4|For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.
Isaiah|31|5|As birds hovering, so will Jehovah of hosts protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver {it}, he will pass over and preserve {it}.
Isaiah|31|6|Turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
Isaiah|31|7|For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
Isaiah|31|8|And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to taskwork.
Isaiah|31|9|And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
Isaiah|32|1|Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.
Isaiah|32|2|And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
Isaiah|32|3|And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
Isaiah|32|4|And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
Isaiah|32|5|The fool shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
Isaiah|32|6|For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
Isaiah|32|7|And the instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
Isaiah|32|8|But the noble deviseth noble things; and in noble things shall he continue.
Isaiah|32|9|Rise up, ye women that are at ease, {and} hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.
Isaiah|32|10|For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.
Isaiah|32|11|Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird {sackcloth} upon your loins.
Isaiah|32|12|They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
Isaiah|32|13|Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
Isaiah|32|14|For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
Isaiah|32|15|until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.
Isaiah|32|16|Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.
Isaiah|32|17|And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence for ever.
Isaiah|32|18|And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.
Isaiah|32|19|But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low.
Isaiah|32|20|Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.
Isaiah|33|1|Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
Isaiah|33|2|O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
Isaiah|33|3|At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.
Isaiah|33|4|And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.
Isaiah|33|5|Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
Isaiah|33|6|And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.
Isaiah|33|7|Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
Isaiah|33|8|The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: {the enemy} hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.
Isaiah|33|9|The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is confounded and withereth away; Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off {their leaves}.
Isaiah|33|10|Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.
Isaiah|33|11|Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
Isaiah|33|12|And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
Isaiah|33|13|Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
Isaiah|33|14|The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?
Isaiah|33|15|He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:
Isaiah|33|16|He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given {him}; his waters shall be sure.
Isaiah|33|17|Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.
Isaiah|33|18|Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed {the tribute}? where is he that counted the towers?
Isaiah|33|19|Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.
Isaiah|33|20|Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
Isaiah|33|21|But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
Isaiah|33|22|For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.
Isaiah|33|23|Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.
Isaiah|33|24|And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
Isaiah|34|1|Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.
Isaiah|34|2|For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
Isaiah|34|3|Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
Isaiah|34|4|And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading {leaf} from the fig-tree.
Isaiah|34|5|For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
Isaiah|34|6|The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
Isaiah|34|7|And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
Isaiah|34|8|For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
Isaiah|34|9|And the streams of {Edom} shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
Isaiah|34|10|It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
Isaiah|34|11|But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
Isaiah|34|12|They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.
Isaiah|34|13|And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.
Isaiah|34|14|And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.
Isaiah|34|15|There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.
Isaiah|34|16|Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.
Isaiah|34|17|And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
Isaiah|35|1|The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
Isaiah|35|2|It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
Isaiah|35|3|Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Isaiah|35|4|Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come {with} vengeance, {with} the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
Isaiah|35|5|Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Isaiah|35|6|Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
Isaiah|35|7|And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
Isaiah|35|8|And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for {the redeemed}: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err {therein}.
Isaiah|35|9|No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk {there}:
Isaiah|35|10|and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
Isaiah|36|1|Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
Isaiah|36|2|And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
Isaiah|36|3|Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
Isaiah|36|4|And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
Isaiah|36|5|I say, {thy} counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
Isaiah|36|6|Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
Isaiah|36|7|But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
Isaiah|36|8|Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
Isaiah|36|9|How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah|36|10|And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Isaiah|36|11|Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
Isaiah|36|12|But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
Isaiah|36|13|Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|14|Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:
Isaiah|36|15|neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|16|Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Isaiah|36|17|until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah|36|18|Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isaiah|36|19|Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|20|Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|21|But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Isaiah|36|22|Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Isaiah|37|1|And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|2|And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
Isaiah|37|3|And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
Isaiah|37|4|It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
Isaiah|37|5|So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah|37|6|And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Isaiah|37|7|Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
Isaiah|37|8|So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
Isaiah|37|9|And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isaiah|37|10|Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|37|11|Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
Isaiah|37|12|Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
Isaiah|37|13|Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
Isaiah|37|14|And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|15|And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
Isaiah|37|16|O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest {above} the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
Isaiah|37|17|Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.
Isaiah|37|18|Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
Isaiah|37|19|and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
Isaiah|37|20|Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.
Isaiah|37|21|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Isaiah|37|22|this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
Isaiah|37|23|Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? {even} against the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|37|24|By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;
Isaiah|37|25|I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
Isaiah|37|26|Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
Isaiah|37|27|Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field {of grain} before it is grown up.
Isaiah|37|28|But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
Isaiah|37|29|Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
Isaiah|37|30|And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
Isaiah|37|31|And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah|37|32|For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah|37|33|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
Isaiah|37|34|By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|35|For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
Isaiah|37|36|And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
Isaiah|37|37|So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
Isaiah|37|38|And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
Isaiah|38|1|In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
Isaiah|38|2|Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah,
Isaiah|38|3|and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
Isaiah|38|4|Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,
Isaiah|38|5|Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
Isaiah|38|6|And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.
Isaiah|38|7|And this shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:
Isaiah|38|8|behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.
Isaiah|38|9|The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
Isaiah|38|10|I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol:                   I am deprived of the residue of my years.
Isaiah|38|11|I said, I shall not see Jehovah, {even} Jehovah in the land of the living:                   I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Isaiah|38|12|My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd’s tent:                   I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom:                   From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isaiah|38|13|I quieted {myself} until morning; as a lion, so he breaketh all my bones:                   From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isaiah|38|14|Like a swallow {or} a crane, so did I chatter;                   I did moan as a dove; mine eyes fail {with looking} upward:                   O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.
Isaiah|38|15|What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it:                   I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
Isaiah|38|16|O Lord, by these things men live;                   And wholly therein is the life of my spirit:                   Wherefore recover thou me, and make me to live.
Isaiah|38|17|Behold, {it was} for {my} peace {that} I had great bitterness:                   But thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;                   For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
Isaiah|38|18|For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee:                   They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
Isaiah|38|19|The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:                   The father to the children shall make known thy truth.
Isaiah|38|20|Jehovah is {ready} to save me:                   Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments                   All the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|38|21|Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
Isaiah|38|22|Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
Isaiah|39|1|At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
Isaiah|39|2|And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
Isaiah|39|3|Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
Isaiah|39|4|Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
Isaiah|39|5|Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:
Isaiah|39|6|Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|39|7|And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

Isaiah|40|5|and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.
Isaiah|40|6|The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.
Isaiah|40|7|The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.
Isaiah|40|8|The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.

Isaiah|40|13|Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?
Isaiah|40|14|With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?

Isaiah|52|12|For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight: for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward.
Isaiah|52|13|Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.
Isaiah|52|14|Like as many were astonished at thee (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),
Isaiah|52|15|so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.
Isaiah|53|1|Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?
Isaiah|53|2|For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
Isaiah|53|3|He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.
Isaiah|53|4|Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
Isaiah|53|5|But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
Isaiah|53|6|All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Isaiah|53|7|He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.
Isaiah|53|8|By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who {among them} considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke {was due}?
Isaiah|53|9|And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
Isaiah|53|10|Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see {his} seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
Isaiah|53|11|He shall see of the travail of his soul, {and} shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.
Isaiah|53|12|Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Isaiah|54|1|Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|54|2|Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.
Isaiah|54|3|For thou shalt spread aboard on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
Isaiah|54|4|Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.
Isaiah|54|5|For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.
Isaiah|54|6|For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy God.
Isaiah|54|7|For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
Isaiah|54|8|In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer.
Isaiah|54|9|For this is {as} the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
Isaiah|54|10|For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.
Isaiah|54|11|O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
Isaiah|54|12|And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.
Isaiah|54|13|And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.
Isaiah|54|14|In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.
Isaiah|54|15|Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.
Isaiah|54|16|Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
Isaiah|54|17|No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|55|1|Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
Isaiah|55|2|Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Isaiah|55|3|Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
Isaiah|55|4|Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.
Isaiah|55|5|Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not; and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
Isaiah|55|6|Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near:
Isaiah|55|7|let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
Isaiah|55|8|For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|55|9|For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
Isaiah|55|10|For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
Isaiah|55|11|so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
Isaiah|55|12|For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.
Isaiah|55|13|Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle-tree: and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
Isaiah|56|1|Thus saith Jehovah, Keep ye justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
Isaiah|56|2|Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth it fast; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
Isaiah|56|3|Neither let the foreigner, that hath joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
Isaiah|56|4|For thus saith Jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:
Isaiah|56|5|Unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
Isaiah|56|6|Also the foreigners that join themselves to Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast my covenant;
Isaiah|56|7|even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
Isaiah|56|8|The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather {others} to him, besides his own that are gathered.
Isaiah|56|9|All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, {yea}, all ye beasts in the forest.
Isaiah|56|10|His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
Isaiah|56|11|Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.
Isaiah|56|12|Come ye, {say they}, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, {a day} great beyond measure.
Isaiah|57|1|The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil {to come}.
Isaiah|57|2|He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.
Isaiah|57|3|But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
Isaiah|57|4|Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
Isaiah|57|5|ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
Isaiah|57|6|Among the smooth {stones} of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?
Isaiah|57|7|Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
Isaiah|57|8|And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered {thyself} to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
Isaiah|57|9|And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.
Isaiah|57|10|Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.
Isaiah|57|11|And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?
Isaiah|57|12|I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.
Isaiah|57|13|When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.
Isaiah|57|14|And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
Isaiah|57|15|For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
Isaiah|57|16|For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.
Isaiah|57|17|For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid {my face} and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
Isaiah|57|18|I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
Isaiah|57|19|I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him.
Isaiah|57|20|But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
Isaiah|57|21|There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
Isaiah|58|1|Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
Isaiah|58|2|Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.
Isaiah|58|3|Wherefore have we fasted, {say they}, and thou seest not? {wherefore} have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find {your own} pleasure, and exact all your labors.
Isaiah|58|4|Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
Isaiah|58|5|Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?
Isaiah|58|6|Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
Isaiah|58|7|Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
Isaiah|58|8|Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.
Isaiah|58|9|Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;
Isaiah|58|10|and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;
Isaiah|58|11|and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
Isaiah|58|12|And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
Isaiah|58|13|If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, {and} the holy of Jehovah honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking {thine own} words:
Isaiah|58|14|then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.
Isaiah|59|1|Behold, Jehovah’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
Isaiah|59|2|but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.
Isaiah|59|3|For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.
Isaiah|59|4|None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
Isaiah|59|5|They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
Isaiah|59|6|Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
Isaiah|59|7|Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.
Isaiah|59|8|The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.
Isaiah|59|9|Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
Isaiah|59|10|We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.
Isaiah|59|11|We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
Isaiah|59|12|For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
Isaiah|59|13|transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
Isaiah|59|14|And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
Isaiah|59|15|Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
Isaiah|59|16|And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.
Isaiah|59|17|And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
Isaiah|59|18|According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.
Isaiah|59|19|So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.
Isaiah|59|20|And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|59|21|And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.
Isaiah|60|1|Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.
Isaiah|60|2|For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
Isaiah|60|3|And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
Isaiah|60|4|Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.
Isaiah|60|5|Then thou shalt see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.

Isaiah|60|8|Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
Isaiah|60|9|Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
Isaiah|60|10|And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.
Isaiah|60|11|Thy gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
Isaiah|60|12|For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
Isaiah|60|13|The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
Isaiah|60|14|And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|60|15|Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
Isaiah|60|16|Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Isaiah|60|17|For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.
Isaiah|60|18|Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
Isaiah|60|19|The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but Jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
Isaiah|60|20|Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
Isaiah|60|21|Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
Isaiah|60|22|The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.
Isaiah|61|1|The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening {of the prison} to them that are bound;
Isaiah|61|2|to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
Isaiah|61|3|to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.
Isaiah|61|4|And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
Isaiah|61|5|And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.
Isaiah|61|6|But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
Isaiah|61|7|Instead of your shame {ye shall have} double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.
Isaiah|61|8|For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
Isaiah|61|9|And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Jehovah hath blessed.
Isaiah|61|10|I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
Isaiah|61|11|For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.

Isaiah|62|6|I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah’s remembrancers, take ye no rest,

Isaiah|62|8|Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored:

Isaiah|63|1|Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
Isaiah|63|2|Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?
Isaiah|63|3|I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.
Isaiah|63|4|For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.

Isaiah|63|7|I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, {and} the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
Isaiah|63|8|For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their Saviour.
Isaiah|63|9|In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
Isaiah|63|10|But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, {and} himself fought against them.
Isaiah|63|11|Then he remembered the days of old, Moses {and} his people, {saying}, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?
Isaiah|63|12|that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
Isaiah|63|13|that led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?
Isaiah|63|14|As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
Isaiah|63|15|Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? the yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.

Isaiah|63|18|Thy holy people possessed {it} but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
Isaiah|63|19|We are become as they over whom thou never barest rule, as they that were not called by thy name.
Isaiah|64|1|Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,
Isaiah|64|2|as when fire kindleth the brushwood, {and} the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
Isaiah|64|3|When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.
Isaiah|64|4|For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.
Isaiah|64|5|Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them {have we been} of long time; and shall we be saved?
Isaiah|64|6|For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
Isaiah|64|7|And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
Isaiah|64|8|But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
Isaiah|64|9|Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
Isaiah|64|10|Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Isaiah|64|11|Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
Isaiah|64|12|Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
Isaiah|65|1|I am inquired of by them that asked not {for me}; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
Isaiah|65|2|I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
Isaiah|65|3|a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;
Isaiah|65|4|that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
Isaiah|65|5|that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
Isaiah|65|6|Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,
Isaiah|65|7|your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.
Isaiah|65|8|Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.
Isaiah|65|9|And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
Isaiah|65|10|And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
Isaiah|65|11|But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;
Isaiah|65|12|I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.
Isaiah|65|13|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;
Isaiah|65|14|behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
Isaiah|65|15|And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:
Isaiah|65|16|so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
Isaiah|65|17|For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
Isaiah|65|18|But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
Isaiah|65|19|And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
Isaiah|65|20|There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
Isaiah|65|21|And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
Isaiah|65|22|They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
Isaiah|65|23|They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
Isaiah|65|24|And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
Isaiah|65|25|The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|1|Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?
Isaiah|66|2|For all these things hath my hand made, and {so} all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.
Isaiah|66|3|He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation, {as he that offereth} swine’s blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:
Isaiah|66|4|I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.
Isaiah|66|5|Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.
Isaiah|66|6|A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.
Isaiah|66|7|Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.
Isaiah|66|8|Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
Isaiah|66|9|Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut {the womb}? saith thy God.
Isaiah|66|10|Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;
Isaiah|66|11|that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
Isaiah|66|12|For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck {thereof}; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.
Isaiah|66|13|As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
Isaiah|66|14|And ye shall see {it}, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.
Isaiah|66|15|For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
Isaiah|66|16|For by fire will Jehovah execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.
Isaiah|66|17|They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves {to go} unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|18|For I {know} their works and their thoughts: {the time} cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.
Isaiah|66|19|And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
Isaiah|66|20|And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|21|And of them also will I take for priests {and} for Levites, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|22|For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.
Isaiah|66|23|And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|24|And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

Song of Songs|1|6|Look not upon me, because I am swarthy,                   Because the sun hath scorched me.                   My mother’s sons were incensed against me;                   They made me keeper of the vineyards;                           {But} mine own vineyard have I not kept.

Song of Songs|2|4|He brought me to the banqueting-house,                   And his banner over me was love.

Song of Songs|3|1|By night on my bed                   I sought him whom my soul loveth:                   I sought him, but I found him not.
Song of Songs|3|2|{I said}, I will rise now, and go about the city;                   In the streets and in the broad ways                   I will seek him whom my soul loveth:                   I sought him, but I found him not.

Song of Songs|5|5|I rose up to open to my beloved;                   And my hands droppeth with myrrh,                   And my fingers with liquid myrrh,                   Upon the handles of the bolt.
Song of Songs|5|6|I opened to my beloved;                   But my beloved had withdrawn himself, {and} was gone.                   My soul had failed me when he spake:                   I sought him, but I could not find him;                   I called him, but he gave me no answer.
Song of Songs|5|7|The watchmen that go about the city found me,                   They smote me, they wounded me;                   The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
Song of Songs|5|8|I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,                   If ye find my beloved,                   That ye tell him, that I am sick from love.

Song of Songs|5|10|My beloved is white and ruddy,                   The chiefest among ten thousand.

Song of Songs|5|12|His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks,                   Washed with milk, {and} fitly set.
Song of Songs|5|13|His cheeks are as a bed of spices,                           {As} banks of sweet herbs:                   His lips are {as} lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.

Song of Songs|6|2|My beloved is gone down to his garden,                   To the beds of spices,                   To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
Song of Songs|6|3|I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine;                   He feedeth {his flock} among the lilies,
Song of Songs|6|4|Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah,                   Comely as Jerusalem,                   Terrible as an army with banners.
Song of Songs|6|5|Turn away thine eyes from me,                   For they have overcome me.                   Thy hair is as a flock of goats,                   That lie along the side of Gilead.
Song of Songs|6|6|Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes,                   Which are come up from the washing;                   Whereof every one hath twins,                   And none is bereaved among them.
Song of Songs|6|7|Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate                   Behind thy veil.

Song of Songs|6|9|My dove, my undefiled, is {but} one;                   She is the only one of her mother;                   She is the choice one of her that bare her.                   The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;                           {Yea}, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Song of Songs|6|10|Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,                   Fair as the moon,                   Clear as the sun,                   Terrible as an army with banners?
Song of Songs|6|11|I went down into the garden of nuts,                   To see the green plants of the valley,                   To see whether the vine budded,                           {And} the pomegranates were in flower.

Song of Songs|7|2|Thy body is {like} a round goblet,                           {Wherein} no mingled wine is wanting:                   Thy waist is {like} a heap of wheat                   Set about with lilies.
Song of Songs|7|3|Thy two breasts are like two fawns                   That are twins of a roe.
Song of Songs|7|4|Thy neck is like the tower of ivory;                   Thine eyes {as} the pools in Heshbon,                   By the gate of Bath-rabbim;                   Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon                   Which looketh toward Damascus.
Song of Songs|7|5|Thy head upon thee is like Carmel,                   And the hair of thy head like purple;                   The king is held captive in the tresses {thereof}.

Song of Songs|7|8|I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree,                   I will take hold of the branches thereof:                   Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine,                   And the smell of thy breath like apples,
Song of Songs|7|9|And thy mouth like the best wine,                   That goeth down smoothly for my beloved,                   Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.
Song of Songs|7|10|I am my beloved’s;                   And his desire is toward me.

Song of Songs|7|12|Let us get up early to the vineyards;                   Let us see whether the vine hath budded,                           {And} its blossom is open,                           {And} the pomegranates are in flower:                   There will I give thee my love.
Song of Songs|7|13|The mandrakes give forth fragrance;                   And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,                   Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
Song of Songs|8|1|Oh that thou wert as my brother,                   That sucked the breasts of my mother!                           {When} I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;                   Yea, and none would despise me.
Song of Songs|8|2|I would lead thee, {and} bring thee into my mother’s house,                   Who would instruct me;                   I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,                   Of the juice of my pomegranate.
Song of Songs|8|3|His left hand {should be} under my head,                   And his right hand should embrace me.
Song of Songs|8|4|I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,                   That ye stir not up, nor awake {my} love,                   Until he please.
Song of Songs|8|5|Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,                   Leaning upon her beloved?                                      Under the apple-tree I awakened thee:                   There thy mother was in travail with thee,                   There was she in travail that brought thee forth.
Song of Songs|8|6|Set me as a seal upon thy heart,                   As a seal upon thine arm:                   For love is strong as death;                   Jealousy is cruel as Sheol;                   The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,                   A very flame of Jehovah.
Song of Songs|8|7|Many waters cannot quench love,                   Neither can floods drown it:                   If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,                   He would utterly be contemned.
Song of Songs|8|8|We have a little sister,                   And she hath no breasts:                   What shall we do for our sister                   In the day when she shall be spoken for?
Song of Songs|8|9|If she be a wall,                   We will build upon her a turret of silver:                   And if she be a door,                   We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
Song of Songs|8|10|I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers {thereof}                   Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
Song of Songs|8|11|Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;                   He let out the vineyard unto keepers;                   Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand {pieces} of silver.
Song of Songs|8|12|My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:                   Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,                   And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
Song of Songs|8|13|Thou that dwellest in the gardens,                   The companions hearken for thy voice:                   Cause me to hear it.
Song of Songs|8|14|Make haste, my beloved,                   And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart                   Upon the mountains of spices.
2 Chronicles|1|1|And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
2 Chronicles|1|2|And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ {houses}.
2 Chronicles|1|3|So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles|1|4|But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to {the place} that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|5|Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.
2 Chronicles|1|6|And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
2 Chronicles|1|7|In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
2 Chronicles|1|8|And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.
2 Chronicles|1|9|Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
2 Chronicles|1|10|Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
2 Chronicles|1|11|And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
2 Chronicles|1|12|wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.
2 Chronicles|1|13|So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles|1|14|And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|15|And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
2 Chronicles|1|16|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
2 Chronicles|1|17|And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
2 Chronicles|2|1|Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|2|And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
2 Chronicles|2|3|And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, {even so deal with me}.
2 Chronicles|2|4|Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is {an ordinance} for ever to Israel.
2 Chronicles|2|5|And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
2 Chronicles|2|6|But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
2 Chronicles|2|7|Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave {all manner of} gravings, {to be} with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
2 Chronicles|2|8|Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
2 Chronicles|2|9|even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
2 Chronicles|2|10|And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2 Chronicles|2|11|Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.
2 Chronicles|2|12|Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|13|And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,
2 Chronicles|2|14|the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be {a place} appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.
2 Chronicles|2|15|Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
2 Chronicles|2|16|and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|2|17|And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
2 Chronicles|2|18|And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.
2 Chronicles|3|1|Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where {Jehovah} appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 Chronicles|3|2|And he began to build in the second {day} of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles|3|3|Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|4|And the porch that was before {the house}, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
2 Chronicles|3|5|And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.
2 Chronicles|3|6|And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles|3|7|He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
2 Chronicles|3|8|And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2 Chronicles|3|9|And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|10|And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|11|And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one {cherub} was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was {likewise} five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|12|And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits {also}, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|13|The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
2 Chronicles|3|14|And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.
2 Chronicles|3|15|Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|16|And he made chains in the oracle, and put {them} on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
2 Chronicles|3|17|And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
2 Chronicles|4|1|Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
2 Chronicles|4|2|Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
2 Chronicles|4|3|And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
2 Chronicles|4|4|It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
2 Chronicles|4|5|And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.
2 Chronicles|4|6|He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2 Chronicles|4|7|And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
2 Chronicles|4|8|He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
2 Chronicles|4|9|Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
2 Chronicles|4|10|And he set the sea on the right side {of the house} eastward, toward the south.
2 Chronicles|4|11|And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:
2 Chronicles|4|12|the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
2 Chronicles|4|13|and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.
2 Chronicles|4|14|He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;
2 Chronicles|4|15|one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
2 Chronicles|4|16|The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.
2 Chronicles|4|17|In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles|4|18|Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2 Chronicles|4|19|And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;
2 Chronicles|4|20|and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
2 Chronicles|4|21|and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;
2 Chronicles|4|22|and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, {to wit}, of the temple, were of gold.
2 Chronicles|5|1|Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|5|2|Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ {houses} of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
2 Chronicles|5|3|nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was {in} the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|5|4|And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;
2 Chronicles|5|5|and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.
2 Chronicles|5|6|And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
2 Chronicles|5|7|And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
2 Chronicles|5|8|For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
2 Chronicles|5|9|And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.
2 Chronicles|5|10|There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put {there} at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|5|11|And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;
2 Chronicles|5|12|also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)
2 Chronicles|5|13|it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, {saying}, For he is good; for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|5|14|so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles|6|1|Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
2 Chronicles|6|2|But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.
2 Chronicles|6|3|And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
2 Chronicles|6|4|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,
2 Chronicles|6|5|Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
2 Chronicles|6|6|but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|7|Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|8|But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
2 Chronicles|6|9|nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
2 Chronicles|6|10|And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|11|And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|12|And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands
2 Chronicles|6|13|(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)
2 Chronicles|6|14|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;
2 Chronicles|6|15|who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
2 Chronicles|6|16|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.
2 Chronicles|6|17|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.
2 Chronicles|6|18|But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!
2 Chronicles|6|19|Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;
2 Chronicles|6|20|that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
2 Chronicles|6|21|And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive.
2 Chronicles|6|22|If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come {and} swear before thine altar in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|23|then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
2 Chronicles|6|24|And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|25|then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|26|When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:
2 Chronicles|6|27|then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
2 Chronicles|6|28|If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;
2 Chronicles|6|29|what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|30|then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)
2 Chronicles|6|31|that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|32|Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|33|then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
2 Chronicles|6|34|If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
2 Chronicles|6|35|then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2 Chronicles|6|36|If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;
2 Chronicles|6|37|yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
2 Chronicles|6|38|if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
2 Chronicles|6|39|then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
2 Chronicles|6|40|Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles|6|41|Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
2 Chronicles|6|42|O Jehovah God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember {thy} lovingkindnesses to David thy servant.
2 Chronicles|7|1|Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
2 Chronicles|7|2|And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah’s house.
2 Chronicles|7|3|And all the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave thanks unto Jehovah, {saying}, For he is good; for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever.
2 Chronicles|7|4|Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|7|5|And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
2 Chronicles|7|6|And the priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks unto Jehovah, (for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.
2 Chronicles|7|7|Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.
2 Chronicles|7|8|So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|7|9|And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
2 Chronicles|7|10|And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
2 Chronicles|7|11|Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
2 Chronicles|7|12|And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
2 Chronicles|7|13|If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
2 Chronicles|7|14|if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
2 Chronicles|7|15|Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles|7|16|For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
2 Chronicles|7|17|And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
2 Chronicles|7|18|then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
2 Chronicles|7|19|But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
2 Chronicles|7|20|then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
2 Chronicles|7|21|And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?
2 Chronicles|7|22|And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.
2 Chronicles|8|1|And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,
2 Chronicles|8|2|that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
2 Chronicles|8|3|And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
2 Chronicles|8|4|And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles|8|5|Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
2 Chronicles|8|6|and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
2 Chronicles|8|7|As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;
2 Chronicles|8|8|of their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, of them did Solomon raise a levy {of bondservants} unto this day.
2 Chronicles|8|9|But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
2 Chronicles|8|10|And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
2 Chronicles|8|11|And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come.
2 Chronicles|8|12|Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,
2 Chronicles|8|13|even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, {even} in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
2 Chronicles|8|14|And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
2 Chronicles|8|15|And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
2 Chronicles|8|16|Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. {So} the house of Jehovah was completed.
2 Chronicles|8|17|Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles|8|18|And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|1|And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
2 Chronicles|9|2|And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.
2 Chronicles|9|3|And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
2 Chronicles|9|4|and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
2 Chronicles|9|5|And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|6|Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
2 Chronicles|9|7|Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|8|Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
2 Chronicles|9|9|And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|10|And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.
2 Chronicles|9|11|And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles|9|12|And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
2 Chronicles|9|13|Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,
2 Chronicles|9|14|besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|15|And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred {shekels} of beaten gold went to one buckler.
2 Chronicles|9|16|And {he made} three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred {shekels} of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles|9|17|Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
2 Chronicles|9|18|nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
2 Chronicles|9|19|And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
2 Chronicles|9|20|And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|21|For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
2 Chronicles|9|22|So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|23|And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
2 Chronicles|9|24|And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
2 Chronicles|9|25|And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|9|26|And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|9|27|And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
2 Chronicles|9|28|And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
2 Chronicles|9|29|Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
2 Chronicles|9|30|And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles|9|31|And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|10|1|And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
2 Chronicles|10|2|And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|10|3|And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,
2 Chronicles|10|4|Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
2 Chronicles|10|5|And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2 Chronicles|10|6|And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
2 Chronicles|10|7|And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
2 Chronicles|10|8|But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.
2 Chronicles|10|9|And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?
2 Chronicles|10|10|And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
2 Chronicles|10|11|And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions.
2 Chronicles|10|12|So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
2 Chronicles|10|13|And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
2 Chronicles|10|14|and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions.
2 Chronicles|10|15|So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
2 Chronicles|10|16|And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.
2 Chronicles|10|17|But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
2 Chronicles|10|18|Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|10|19|So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2 Chronicles|11|1|And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles|11|2|But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
2 Chronicles|11|3|Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
2 Chronicles|11|4|Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles|11|5|And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
2 Chronicles|11|6|He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
2 Chronicles|11|7|And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
2 Chronicles|11|8|and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
2 Chronicles|11|9|and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
2 Chronicles|11|10|and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
2 Chronicles|11|11|And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.
2 Chronicles|11|12|And in every city {he put} shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
2 Chronicles|11|13|And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.
2 Chronicles|11|14|For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office unto Jehovah;
2 Chronicles|11|15|and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.
2 Chronicles|11|16|And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|11|17|So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.
2 Chronicles|11|18|And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, {and of} Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
2 Chronicles|11|19|and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles|11|20|And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles|11|21|And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)
2 Chronicles|11|22|And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, {even} the prince among his brethren; for {he was minded} to make him king.
2 Chronicles|11|23|And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them victuals in abundance. And he sought {for them} many wives.
2 Chronicles|12|1|And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
2 Chronicles|12|2|And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|12|3|with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles|12|4|And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|12|5|Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles|12|6|Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.
2 Chronicles|12|7|And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles|12|8|Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Chronicles|12|9|So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles|12|10|And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king’s house.
2 Chronicles|12|11|And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
2 Chronicles|12|12|And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things {found}.
2 Chronicles|12|13|So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
2 Chronicles|12|14|And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|12|15|Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
2 Chronicles|12|16|And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|13|1|In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
2 Chronicles|13|2|Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles|13|3|And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|13|4|And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:
2 Chronicles|13|5|Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles|13|6|Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.
2 Chronicles|13|7|And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
2 Chronicles|13|8|And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
2 Chronicles|13|9|Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of {other} lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of {them that are} no gods.
2 Chronicles|13|10|But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and {we have} priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
2 Chronicles|13|11|and they burn unto Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also {set they} in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.
2 Chronicles|13|12|And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
2 Chronicles|13|13|But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
2 Chronicles|13|14|And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles|13|15|Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles|13|16|And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.
2 Chronicles|13|17|And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
2 Chronicles|13|18|Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|13|19|And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.
2 Chronicles|13|20|Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.
2 Chronicles|13|21|But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles|13|22|And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
2 Chronicles|14|1|So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
2 Chronicles|14|2|And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:
2 Chronicles|14|3|for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,
2 Chronicles|14|4|and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
2 Chronicles|14|5|Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
2 Chronicles|14|6|And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.
2 Chronicles|14|7|For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
2 Chronicles|14|8|And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|14|9|And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.
2 Chronicles|14|10|Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2 Chronicles|14|11|And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
2 Chronicles|14|12|So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
2 Chronicles|14|13|And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.
2 Chronicles|14|14|And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.
2 Chronicles|14|15|They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|15|1|And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
2 Chronicles|15|2|and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
2 Chronicles|15|3|Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:
2 Chronicles|15|4|But when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
2 Chronicles|15|5|And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
2 Chronicles|15|6|And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.
2 Chronicles|15|7|But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.
2 Chronicles|15|8|And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|15|9|And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
2 Chronicles|15|10|So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles|15|11|And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles|15|12|And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;
2 Chronicles|15|13|and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
2 Chronicles|15|14|And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
2 Chronicles|15|15|And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about.
2 Chronicles|15|16|And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|15|17|But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
2 Chronicles|15|18|And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
2 Chronicles|15|19|And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles|16|1|In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|16|2|Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
2 Chronicles|16|3|{There is} a league between me and thee, as {there was} between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
2 Chronicles|16|4|And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles|16|5|And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.
2 Chronicles|16|6|Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles|16|7|And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
2 Chronicles|16|8|Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.
2 Chronicles|16|9|For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
2 Chronicles|16|10|Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
2 Chronicles|16|11|And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|16|12|And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.
2 Chronicles|16|13|And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles|16|14|And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds {of spices} prepared by the perfumers’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.
2 Chronicles|17|1|And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles|17|2|And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
2 Chronicles|17|3|And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,
2 Chronicles|17|4|but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|17|5|Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
2 Chronicles|17|6|And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
2 Chronicles|17|7|Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
2 Chronicles|17|8|and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
2 Chronicles|17|9|And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.
2 Chronicles|17|10|And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles|17|11|And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.
2 Chronicles|17|12|And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.
2 Chronicles|17|13|And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|17|14|And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;
2 Chronicles|17|15|and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;
2 Chronicles|17|16|and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|17|17|And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
2 Chronicles|17|18|and next to him Jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.
2 Chronicles|17|19|These were they that waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2 Chronicles|18|1|Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.
2 Chronicles|18|2|And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up {with him} to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles|18|3|And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and {we will be} with thee in the war.
2 Chronicles|18|4|And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|18|5|Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.
2 Chronicles|18|6|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
2 Chronicles|18|7|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
2 Chronicles|18|8|Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
2 Chronicles|18|9|Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
2 Chronicles|18|10|And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
2 Chronicles|18|11|And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
2 Chronicles|18|12|And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets {declare} good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
2 Chronicles|18|13|And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.
2 Chronicles|18|14|And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.
2 Chronicles|18|15|And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
2 Chronicles|18|16|And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
2 Chronicles|18|17|And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
2 Chronicles|18|18|And {Micaiah} said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
2 Chronicles|18|19|And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
2 Chronicles|18|20|And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?
2 Chronicles|18|21|And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
2 Chronicles|18|22|Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.
2 Chronicles|18|23|Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?
2 Chronicles|18|24|And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
2 Chronicles|18|25|And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
2 Chronicles|18|26|and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
2 Chronicles|18|27|And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
2 Chronicles|18|28|So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles|18|29|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.
2 Chronicles|18|30|Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|18|31|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God moved them {to depart} from him.
2 Chronicles|18|32|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
2 Chronicles|18|33|And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
2 Chronicles|18|34|And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
2 Chronicles|19|1|And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|19|2|And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|19|3|Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.
2 Chronicles|19|4|And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|19|5|And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
2 Chronicles|19|6|and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah; and {he is} with you in the judgment.
2 Chronicles|19|7|Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
2 Chronicles|19|8|Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|19|9|And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles|19|10|And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty.
2 Chronicles|19|11|And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.
2 Chronicles|20|1|And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
2 Chronicles|20|2|Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).
2 Chronicles|20|3|And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
2 Chronicles|20|4|And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek {help} of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|5|And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;
2 Chronicles|20|6|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.
2 Chronicles|20|7|Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
2 Chronicles|20|8|And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,
2 Chronicles|20|9|If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.
2 Chronicles|20|10|And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;
2 Chronicles|20|11|behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
2 Chronicles|20|12|O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
2 Chronicles|20|13|And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
2 Chronicles|20|14|Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;
2 Chronicles|20|15|and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
2 Chronicles|20|16|To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles|20|17|Ye shall not need to fight in this {battle}: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them: for Jehovah is with you.
2 Chronicles|20|18|And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|19|And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.
2 Chronicles|20|20|And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
2 Chronicles|20|21|And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever.
2 Chronicles|20|22|And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
2 Chronicles|20|23|For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
2 Chronicles|20|24|And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.
2 Chronicles|20|25|And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
2 Chronicles|20|26|And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day.
2 Chronicles|20|27|Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
2 Chronicles|20|28|And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|29|And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles|20|30|So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.
2 Chronicles|20|31|And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles|20|32|And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|33|Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|20|34|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|20|35|And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:
2 Chronicles|20|36|and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
2 Chronicles|20|37|Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah hath destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
2 Chronicles|21|1|And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|21|2|And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|21|3|And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.
2 Chronicles|21|4|Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
2 Chronicles|21|5|Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|21|6|And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|21|7|Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.
2 Chronicles|21|8|In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
2 Chronicles|21|9|Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.
2 Chronicles|21|10|So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|21|11|Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.
2 Chronicles|21|12|And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
2 Chronicles|21|13|but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself:
2 Chronicles|21|14|behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;
2 Chronicles|21|15|and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
2 Chronicles|21|16|And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:
2 Chronicles|21|17|and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2 Chronicles|21|18|And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
2 Chronicles|21|19|And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|21|20|Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2 Chronicles|22|1|And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
2 Chronicles|22|2|Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
2 Chronicles|22|3|He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
2 Chronicles|22|4|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
2 Chronicles|22|5|He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Chronicles|22|6|And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2 Chronicles|22|7|Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
2 Chronicles|22|8|And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.
2 Chronicles|22|9|And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
2 Chronicles|22|10|Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
2 Chronicles|22|11|But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
2 Chronicles|22|12|And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Chronicles|23|1|And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
2 Chronicles|23|2|And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ {houses} of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|23|3|And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.
2 Chronicles|23|4|This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;
2 Chronicles|23|5|and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|6|But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|7|And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
2 Chronicles|23|8|So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
2 Chronicles|23|9|And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God.
2 Chronicles|23|10|And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
2 Chronicles|23|11|Then they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and {gave him} the testimony, and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said, {Long} live the king.
2 Chronicles|23|12|And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:
2 Chronicles|23|13|and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also {played} on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!
2 Chronicles|23|14|And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|15|So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house: and they slew her there.
2 Chronicles|23|16|And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah’s people.
2 Chronicles|23|17|And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
2 Chronicles|23|18|And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.
2 Chronicles|23|19|And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.
2 Chronicles|23|20|And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
2 Chronicles|23|21|So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword.
2 Chronicles|24|1|Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.
2 Chronicles|24|2|And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles|24|3|And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles|24|4|And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|5|And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
2 Chronicles|24|6|And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
2 Chronicles|24|7|For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.
2 Chronicles|24|8|So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|9|And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles|24|10|And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
2 Chronicles|24|11|And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
2 Chronicles|24|12|And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|13|So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
2 Chronicles|24|14|And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
2 Chronicles|24|15|But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
2 Chronicles|24|16|And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
2 Chronicles|24|17|Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
2 Chronicles|24|18|And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
2 Chronicles|24|19|Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
2 Chronicles|24|20|And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you.
2 Chronicles|24|21|And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|22|Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.
2 Chronicles|24|23|And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
2 Chronicles|24|24|For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.
2 Chronicles|24|25|And when they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2 Chronicles|24|26|And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
2 Chronicles|24|27|Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens {laid} upon him, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|25|1|Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|25|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles|25|3|Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
2 Chronicles|25|4|But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Chronicles|25|5|Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
2 Chronicles|25|6|He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles|25|7|But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel, {to wit}, with all the children of Ephraim.
2 Chronicles|25|8|But if thou wilt go, do {valiantly}, be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
2 Chronicles|25|9|And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.
2 Chronicles|25|10|Then Amaziah separated them, {to wit}, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
2 Chronicles|25|11|And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
2 Chronicles|25|12|And {other} ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
2 Chronicles|25|13|But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
2 Chronicles|25|14|Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
2 Chronicles|25|15|Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?
2 Chronicles|25|16|And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that {the king} said unto him, Have we made thee of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
2 Chronicles|25|17|Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Chronicles|25|18|And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Chronicles|25|19|Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2 Chronicles|25|20|But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand {of their enemies}, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles|25|21|So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Chronicles|25|22|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Chronicles|25|23|And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Chronicles|25|24|And {he took} all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|25|25|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Chronicles|25|26|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
2 Chronicles|25|27|Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Chronicles|25|28|And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2 Chronicles|26|1|And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2 Chronicles|26|2|He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2 Chronicles|26|3|Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|26|4|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles|26|5|And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.
2 Chronicles|26|6|And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in {the country of} Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
2 Chronicles|26|7|And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.
2 Chronicles|26|8|And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong.
2 Chronicles|26|9|Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning {of the wall}, and fortified them.
2 Chronicles|26|10|And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: {and he had} husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.
2 Chronicles|26|11|Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.
2 Chronicles|26|12|The whole number of the heads of fathers’ {houses}, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.
2 Chronicles|26|13|And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
2 Chronicles|26|14|And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.
2 Chronicles|26|15|And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
2 Chronicles|26|16|But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|17|And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:
2 Chronicles|26|18|and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.
2 Chronicles|26|19|Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|20|And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.
2 Chronicles|26|21|And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
2 Chronicles|26|22|Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
2 Chronicles|26|23|So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|27|1|Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles|27|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly.
2 Chronicles|27|3|He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
2 Chronicles|27|4|Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
2 Chronicles|27|5|He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third.
2 Chronicles|27|6|So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|27|7|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles|27|8|He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|27|9|And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|28|1|Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;
2 Chronicles|28|2|but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.
2 Chronicles|28|3|Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|4|And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles|28|5|Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
2 Chronicles|28|6|For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|28|7|And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
2 Chronicles|28|8|And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|28|9|But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven.
2 Chronicles|28|10|And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: {but} are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?
2 Chronicles|28|11|Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
2 Chronicles|28|12|Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
2 Chronicles|28|13|and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|14|So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|28|15|And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|28|16|At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
2 Chronicles|28|17|For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
2 Chronicles|28|18|The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.
2 Chronicles|28|19|For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|28|20|And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
2 Chronicles|28|21|For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.
2 Chronicles|28|22|And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.
2 Chronicles|28|23|For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, {therefore} will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|24|And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|28|25|And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|28|26|Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|27|And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|29|1|Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles|29|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
2 Chronicles|29|3|He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.
2 Chronicles|29|4|And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
2 Chronicles|29|5|and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
2 Chronicles|29|6|For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.
2 Chronicles|29|7|Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|8|Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
2 Chronicles|29|9|For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
2 Chronicles|29|10|Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
2 Chronicles|29|11|My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.
2 Chronicles|29|12|Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
2 Chronicles|29|13|and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2 Chronicles|29|14|and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2 Chronicles|29|15|And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|16|And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|29|17|Now they began on the first {day} of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
2 Chronicles|29|18|Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within {the palace}, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|29|19|Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|20|Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|21|And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|22|So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
2 Chronicles|29|23|And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:
2 Chronicles|29|24|and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded {that} the burnt-offering and the sin-offering {should be made} for all Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|25|And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.
2 Chronicles|29|26|And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles|29|27|And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|28|And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this {continued} until the burnt-offering was finished.
2 Chronicles|29|29|And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
2 Chronicles|29|30|Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
2 Chronicles|29|31|Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart {brought} burnt-offerings.
2 Chronicles|29|32|And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|33|And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles|29|34|But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
2 Chronicles|29|35|And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
2 Chronicles|29|36|And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
2 Chronicles|30|1|And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|30|2|For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles|30|3|For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|4|And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|5|So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
2 Chronicles|30|6|So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
2 Chronicles|30|7|And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
2 Chronicles|30|8|Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
2 Chronicles|30|9|For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
2 Chronicles|30|10|So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
2 Chronicles|30|11|Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|12|Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|13|And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|14|And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|30|15|Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|16|And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood {which they received} of the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|30|17|For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|18|For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one
2 Chronicles|30|19|that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though {he be} not {cleansed} according to the purification of the sanctuary.
2 Chronicles|30|20|And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2 Chronicles|30|21|And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, {singing} with loud instruments unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|22|And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding {in the service} of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|30|23|And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept {other} seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles|30|24|For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2 Chronicles|30|25|And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
2 Chronicles|30|26|So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|27|Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.
2 Chronicles|31|1|Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2 Chronicles|31|2|And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|3|{He appointed} also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, {to wit}, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|4|Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|5|And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
2 Chronicles|31|6|And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|7|In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|31|8|And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|31|9|Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|10|And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since {the people} began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
2 Chronicles|31|11|Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them.
2 Chronicles|31|12|And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.
2 Chronicles|31|13|And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|31|14|And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east {gate}, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
2 Chronicles|31|15|And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
2 Chronicles|31|16|besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|17|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|18|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.
2 Chronicles|31|19|Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
2 Chronicles|31|20|And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|31|21|And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
2 Chronicles|32|1|After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
2 Chronicles|32|2|And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles|32|3|he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.
2 Chronicles|32|4|So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
2 Chronicles|32|5|And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised {it} up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo {in} the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
2 Chronicles|32|6|And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|7|Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:
2 Chronicles|32|8|with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|32|9|After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|10|Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?
2 Chronicles|32|11|Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Chronicles|32|12|Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?
2 Chronicles|32|13|Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|14|Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|15|Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|16|And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|17|He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
2 Chronicles|32|18|And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
2 Chronicles|32|19|And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.
2 Chronicles|32|20|And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
2 Chronicles|32|21|And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
2 Chronicles|32|22|Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all {others}, and guided them on every side.
2 Chronicles|32|23|And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
2 Chronicles|32|24|In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.
2 Chronicles|32|25|But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|32|26|Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|27|And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;
2 Chronicles|32|28|store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.
2 Chronicles|32|29|Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.
2 Chronicles|32|30|This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2 Chronicles|32|31|Howbeit in {the business of} the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2 Chronicles|32|32|Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|32|33|And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|33|1|Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|3|For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|4|And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
2 Chronicles|33|5|And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|33|6|He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Chronicles|33|7|And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
2 Chronicles|33|8|neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances {given} by Moses.
2 Chronicles|33|9|And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|10|And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.
2 Chronicles|33|11|Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|33|12|And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|33|13|And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.
2 Chronicles|33|14|Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about {with it}, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles|33|15|And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
2 Chronicles|33|16|And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|17|Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.
2 Chronicles|33|18|Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|19|His prayer also, and how {God} was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
2 Chronicles|33|20|So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|33|21|Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|22|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|23|And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
2 Chronicles|33|24|And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
2 Chronicles|33|25|But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Chronicles|34|1|Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Chronicles|34|3|For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.
2 Chronicles|34|4|And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves {of them} that had sacrificed unto them.
2 Chronicles|34|5|And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|6|And {so did he} in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
2 Chronicles|34|7|And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|8|Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|34|9|And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|10|And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;
2 Chronicles|34|11|even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2 Chronicles|34|12|And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and {others of} the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.
2 Chronicles|34|13|Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2 Chronicles|34|14|And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah {given} by Moses.
2 Chronicles|34|15|And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
2 Chronicles|34|16|And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.
2 Chronicles|34|17|And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
2 Chronicles|34|18|And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.
2 Chronicles|34|19|And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2 Chronicles|34|20|And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
2 Chronicles|34|21|Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|22|So Hilkiah, and they whom the king {had commanded}, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.
2 Chronicles|34|23|And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,
2 Chronicles|34|24|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|34|25|Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
2 Chronicles|34|26|But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,
2 Chronicles|34|27|because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|28|Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.
2 Chronicles|34|29|Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|30|And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|31|And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|32|And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand {to it}. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|34|33|And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|35|1|And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
2 Chronicles|35|2|And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|35|3|And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|35|4|And prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
2 Chronicles|35|5|And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the children of the people, and {let there be for each} a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|35|6|And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.
2 Chronicles|35|7|And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.
2 Chronicles|35|8|And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred {small cattle}, and three hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|9|Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand {small cattle}, and five hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|10|So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king’s commandment.
2 Chronicles|35|11|And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled {the blood which they received} of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
2 Chronicles|35|12|And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|13|And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
2 Chronicles|35|14|And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron {were busied} in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles|35|15|And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2 Chronicles|35|16|So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|17|And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
2 Chronicles|35|18|And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|35|19|In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
2 Chronicles|35|20|After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
2 Chronicles|35|21|But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? {I come} not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from {meddling with} God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
2 Chronicles|35|22|Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles|35|23|And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
2 Chronicles|35|24|So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|25|And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
2 Chronicles|35|26|Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|35|27|and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles|36|1|Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|2|Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|3|And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2 Chronicles|36|4|And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles|36|5|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|36|6|Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|7|Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|8|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|36|9|Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|10|And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|11|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
2 Chronicles|36|12|and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet {speaking} from the mouth of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|13|And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|36|14|Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|15|And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
2 Chronicles|36|16|but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
2 Chronicles|36|17|Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
2 Chronicles|36|18|And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|19|And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|36|20|And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
2 Chronicles|36|21|to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: {for} as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
2 Chronicles|36|22|Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
2 Chronicles|36|23|Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.
Philippians|1|1|Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
Philippians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians|1|3|I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,
Philippians|1|4|always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,
Philippians|1|5|for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;
Philippians|1|6|being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:
Philippians|1|7|even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.
Philippians|1|8|For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
Philippians|1|9|And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
Philippians|1|10|so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;
Philippians|1|11|being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
Philippians|1|12|Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things {which happened} unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;
Philippians|1|13|so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;
Philippians|1|14|and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
Philippians|1|15|Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Philippians|1|16|the one {do it} of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;
Philippians|1|17|but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.
Philippians|1|18|What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
Philippians|1|19|For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians|1|20|according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but {that} with all boldness, as always, {so} now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
Philippians|1|21|For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Philippians|1|22|But if to live in the flesh, --{if} this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.
Philippians|1|23|But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:
Philippians|1|24|yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
Philippians|1|25|And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;
Philippians|1|26|that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
Philippians|1|27|Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;
Philippians|1|28|and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;
Philippians|1|29|because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:
Philippians|1|30|having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
Philippians|2|1|If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,
Philippians|2|2|make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
Philippians|2|3|{doing} nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;
Philippians|2|4|not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
Philippians|2|5|Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
Philippians|2|6|who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,
Philippians|2|7|but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;
Philippians|2|8|and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient {even} unto death, yea, the death of the cross.
Philippians|2|9|Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;
Philippians|2|10|that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of {things} in heaven and {things} on earth and {things} under the earth,
Philippians|2|11|and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians|2|12|So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
Philippians|2|13|for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
Philippians|2|14|Do all things without murmurings and questionings:
Philippians|2|15|that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,
Philippians|2|16|holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.
Philippians|2|17|Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:
Philippians|2|18|and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.
Philippians|2|19|But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
Philippians|2|20|For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.
Philippians|2|21|For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
Philippians|2|22|But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child {serveth} a father, {so} he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.
Philippians|2|23|Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:
Philippians|2|24|but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.
Philippians|2|25|But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;
Philippians|2|26|since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:
Philippians|2|27|for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians|2|28|I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Philippians|2|29|Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:
Philippians|2|30|because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
Philippians|3|1|Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.
Philippians|3|2|Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:
Philippians|3|3|for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:
Philippians|3|4|though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:
Philippians|3|5|circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
Philippians|3|6|as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
Philippians|3|7|Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.
Philippians|3|8|Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,
Philippians|3|9|and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, {even} that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:
Philippians|3|10|that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;
Philippians|3|11|if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians|3|12|Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
Philippians|3|13|Brethren, I could not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing {I do}, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,
Philippians|3|14|I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|3|15|Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:
Philippians|3|16|only, whereunto we have attained, by that same {rule} let us walk.
Philippians|3|17|Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.
Philippians|3|18|For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, {that they are} the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Philippians|3|19|whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and {whose} glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
Philippians|3|20|For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Philippians|3|21|who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, {that it may be} conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.
Philippians|4|1|Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.
Philippians|4|2|I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.
Philippians|4|3|Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Philippians|4|4|Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.
Philippians|4|5|Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
Philippians|4|6|In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
Philippians|4|7|And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|8|Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
Philippians|4|9|The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
Philippians|4|10|But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.
Philippians|4|11|Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.
Philippians|4|12|I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
Philippians|4|13|I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.
Philippians|4|14|Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.
Philippians|4|15|And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;
Philippians|4|16|for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.
Philippians|4|17|Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.
Philippians|4|18|But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things {that came} from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
Philippians|4|19|And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|20|Now unto our God and Father {be} the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians|4|21|Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
Philippians|4|22|All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar’s household.
Philippians|4|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Luke|1|1|Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
Luke|1|2|even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,
Luke|1|3|it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;
Luke|1|4|that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.
Luke|1|5|There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
Luke|1|6|And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
Luke|1|7|And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were {now} well stricken in years.
Luke|1|8|Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
Luke|1|9|according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
Luke|1|10|And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
Luke|1|11|And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of altar of incense.
Luke|1|12|And Zacharias was troubled when he saw {him}, and fear fell upon him.
Luke|1|13|But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
Luke|1|14|And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke|1|15|For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
Luke|1|16|And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.
Luke|1|17|And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient {to walk} in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared {for him}.
Luke|1|18|And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
Luke|1|19|And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.
Luke|1|20|And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
Luke|1|21|And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.
Luke|1|22|And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.
Luke|1|23|And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.
Luke|1|24|And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,
Luke|1|25|Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon {me}, to take away my reproach among men.
Luke|1|26|Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
Luke|1|27|to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
Luke|1|28|And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord {is} with thee.
Luke|1|29|But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.
Luke|1|30|And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.
Luke|1|31|And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
Luke|1|32|He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
Luke|1|33|and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke|1|34|And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
Luke|1|35|And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.
Luke|1|36|And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.
Luke|1|37|For no word from God shall be void of power.
Luke|1|38|And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
Luke|1|39|And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;
Luke|1|40|and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.
Luke|1|41|And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;
Luke|1|42|and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed {art} thou among women, and blessed {is} the fruit of thy womb.
Luke|1|43|And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?
Luke|1|44|For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
Luke|1|45|And blessed {is} she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.
Luke|1|46|And Mary said,             My soul doth magnify the Lord,
Luke|1|47|And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
Luke|1|48|For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid:                   For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
Luke|1|49|For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;                   And holy is his name.
Luke|1|50|And his mercy is unto generations and generations                   On them that fear him.
Luke|1|51|He hath showed strength with his arm;                   He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
Luke|1|52|He hath put down princes from {their} thrones,                   And hath exalted them of low degree.
Luke|1|53|The hungry he hath filled with good things;                   And the rich he hath sent empty away.
Luke|1|54|He hath given help to Israel his servant,                   That he might remember mercy
Luke|1|55|(As he spake unto our fathers)                   Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.
Luke|1|56|And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.
Luke|1|57|Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
Luke|1|58|And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
Luke|1|59|And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.
Luke|1|60|And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
Luke|1|61|And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
Luke|1|62|And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
Luke|1|63|And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
Luke|1|64|And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue {loosed}, and he spake, blessing God.
Luke|1|65|And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
Luke|1|66|And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.
Luke|1|67|And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
Luke|1|68|Blessed {be} the Lord, the God of Israel;                   For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,
Luke|1|69|And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us                   In the house of his servant David
Luke|1|70|(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),
Luke|1|71|Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
Luke|1|72|To show mercy towards, our fathers,                   And to remember his holy covenant;
Luke|1|73|The oath which he spake unto Abraham our father,
Luke|1|74|To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies                   Should serve him without fear,
Luke|1|75|In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
Luke|1|76|Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High:                   For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;
Luke|1|77|To give knowledge of salvation unto his people                   In the remission of their sins,
Luke|1|78|Because of the tender mercy of our God,                   Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,
Luke|1|79|To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;                   To guide our feet into the way of peace.
Luke|1|80|And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.
Luke|2|1|Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.
Luke|2|2|This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke|2|3|And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.
Luke|2|4|And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
Luke|2|5|to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child.
Luke|2|6|And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.
Luke|2|7|And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Luke|2|8|And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
Luke|2|9|And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
Luke|2|10|And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:
Luke|2|11|for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
Luke|2|12|And this {is} the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.
Luke|2|13|And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
Luke|2|14|Glory to God in the highest,                   And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.
Luke|2|15|And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
Luke|2|16|And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
Luke|2|17|And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
Luke|2|18|And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.
Luke|2|19|But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
Luke|2|20|And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.
Luke|2|21|And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Luke|2|22|And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord
Luke|2|23|(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),
Luke|2|24|and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
Luke|2|25|And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke|2|26|And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke|2|27|And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,
Luke|2|28|then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
Luke|2|29|Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord,                   According to thy word, in peace;
Luke|2|30|For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
Luke|2|31|Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;
Luke|2|32|A light for revelation to the Gentiles,                   And the glory of thy people Israel.
Luke|2|33|And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;
Luke|2|34|and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this {child} is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;
Luke|2|35|yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.
Luke|2|36|And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
Luke|2|37|and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.
Luke|2|38|And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
Luke|2|39|And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
Luke|2|40|And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
Luke|2|41|And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
Luke|2|42|And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;
Luke|2|43|and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;
Luke|2|44|but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance:
Luke|2|45|and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.
Luke|2|46|And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:
Luke|2|47|and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
Luke|2|48|And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.
Luke|2|49|And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?
Luke|2|50|And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
Luke|2|51|And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all {these} sayings in her heart.
Luke|2|52|And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
Luke|3|1|Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke|3|2|in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
Luke|3|3|And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;
Luke|3|4|as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.
Luke|3|5|Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough ways smooth;
Luke|3|6|And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Luke|3|7|He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Luke|3|9|And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Luke|3|10|And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?
Luke|3|11|And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.
Luke|3|12|And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do?
Luke|3|13|And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.
Luke|3|14|And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse {any one} wrongfully; and be content with your wages.
Luke|3|15|And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;
Luke|3|16|John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and {in} fire:
Luke|3|17|whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Luke|3|18|With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people;
Luke|3|19|but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,
Luke|3|20|added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
Luke|3|21|Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
Luke|3|22|and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
Luke|3|23|And Jesus himself, when he began {to teach}, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the {son} of Heli,
Luke|3|24|the {son} of Matthat, the {son} of Levi, the {son} of Melchi, the {son} of Jannai, the {son} of Joseph,
Luke|3|25|the {son} of Mattathias, the {son} of Amos, the {son} of Nahum, the {son} of Esli, the {son} of Naggai,
Luke|3|26|the {son} of Maath, the {son} of Mattathias, the {son} of Semein, the {son} of Josech, the {son} of Joda,
Luke|3|27|the {son} of Joanan, the {son} of Rhesa, the {son} of Zerubbabel, the {son} of Shealtiel, the {son} of Neri,
Luke|3|28|the {son} of Melchi, the {son} of Addi, the {son} of Cosam, the {son} of Elmadam, the {son} of Er,
Luke|3|29|the {son} of Jesus, the {son} of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the {son} of Matthat, the {son} of Levi,
Luke|3|30|the {son} of Symeon, the {son} of Judas, the {son} of Joseph, the {son} of Jonam, the {son} of Eliakim,
Luke|3|31|the {son} of Melea, the {son} of Menna, the {son} of Mattatha, the {son} of Nathan, the {son} of David,
Luke|3|32|the {son} of Jesse, the {son} of Obed, the {son} of Boaz, the {son} of Salmon, the {son} of Nahshon,
Luke|3|33|the {son} of Amminadab, the {son} of Arni, the {son} of Hezron, the {son} of Perez, the {son} of Judah,
Luke|3|34|the {son} of Jacob, the {son} of Isaac, the {son} of Abraham, the {son} of Terah, the {son} of Nahor,
Luke|3|35|the {son} of Serug, the {son} of Reu, the {son} of Peleg, the {son} of Eber, the {son} of Shelah
Luke|3|36|the {son} of Cainan, the {son} of Arphaxad, the {son} of Shem, the {son} of Noah, the {son} of Lamech,
Luke|3|37|the {son} of Methuselah, the {son} of Enoch, the {son} of Jared, the {son} of Mahalaleel, the {son} of Cainan,
Luke|3|38|the {son} of Enos, the {son} of Seth, the {son} of Adam, the {son} of God.
Luke|4|1|And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness
Luke|4|2|during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered.
Luke|4|3|And the devil said unto him, if thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.
Luke|4|4|And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.
Luke|4|5|And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke|4|6|And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
Luke|4|7|If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine.
Luke|4|8|And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Luke|4|9|And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
Luke|4|10|for it is written,             He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee:
Luke|4|11|and,             On their hands they shall bear thee up,                   Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Luke|4|12|And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
Luke|4|13|And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.
Luke|4|14|And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about.
Luke|4|15|And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
Luke|4|16|And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.
Luke|4|17|And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
Luke|4|18|The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,                   Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor:                   He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives,                   And recovering of sight to the blind,                   To set at liberty them that are bruised,
Luke|4|19|To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
Luke|4|20|And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
Luke|4|21|And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.
Luke|4|22|And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
Luke|4|23|And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.
Luke|4|24|And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.
Luke|4|25|But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;
Luke|4|26|and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.
Luke|4|27|And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.
Luke|4|28|And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;
Luke|4|29|and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.
Luke|4|30|But he passing through the midst of them went his way.
Luke|4|31|And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:
Luke|4|32|and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.
Luke|4|33|And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke|4|34|Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Luke|4|35|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.
Luke|4|36|And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
Luke|4|37|And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.
Luke|4|38|And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
Luke|4|39|And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.
Luke|4|40|And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
Luke|4|41|And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
Luke|4|42|And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.
Luke|4|43|But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.
Luke|4|44|And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke|5|1|Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
Luke|5|2|and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
Luke|5|3|And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.
Luke|5|4|And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
Luke|5|5|And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.
Luke|5|6|And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;
Luke|5|7|and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke|5|8|But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
Luke|5|9|For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;
Luke|5|10|and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
Luke|5|11|And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.
Luke|5|12|And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Luke|5|13|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.
Luke|5|14|And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Luke|5|15|But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.
Luke|5|16|But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.
Luke|5|17|And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
Luke|5|18|And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
Luke|5|19|And not finding by what {way} they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
Luke|5|20|And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
Luke|5|21|And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
Luke|5|22|But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?
Luke|5|23|Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
Luke|5|24|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.
Luke|5|25|And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.
Luke|5|26|And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.
Luke|5|27|And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.
Luke|5|28|And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.
Luke|5|29|And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.
Luke|5|30|And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?
Luke|5|31|And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.
Luke|5|32|I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
Luke|5|33|And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the {disciples} of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.
Luke|5|34|And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
Luke|5|35|But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.
Luke|5|36|And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.
Luke|5|37|And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.
Luke|5|38|But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.
Luke|5|39|And no man having drunk old {wine} desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.
Luke|6|1|Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
Luke|6|2|But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?
Luke|6|3|And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him;
Luke|6|4|how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?
Luke|6|5|And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
Luke|6|6|And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
Luke|6|7|And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.
Luke|6|8|But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
Luke|6|9|And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?
Luke|6|10|And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did {so}: and his hand was restored.
Luke|6|11|But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke|6|12|And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.
Luke|6|13|And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:
Luke|6|14|Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
Luke|6|15|and Matthew and Thomas, and James {the son} of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,
Luke|6|16|and Judas {the son} of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;
Luke|6|17|and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
Luke|6|18|and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
Luke|6|19|And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed {them} all.
Luke|6|20|And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed {are} ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke|6|21|Blessed {are} ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed {are} ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke|6|22|Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you {from their company}, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
Luke|6|23|Rejoice in that day, and leap {for joy}: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
Luke|6|24|But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Luke|6|25|Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe {unto you}, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke|6|26|Woe {unto you}, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.
Luke|6|27|But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
Luke|6|28|bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.
Luke|6|29|To him that smiteth thee on the {one} cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.
Luke|6|30|Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
Luke|6|31|And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
Luke|6|32|And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.
Luke|6|33|And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.
Luke|6|34|And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.
Luke|6|35|But love your enemies, and do {them} good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
Luke|6|36|Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
Luke|6|37|And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:
Luke|6|38|give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.
Luke|6|39|And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?
Luke|6|40|The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.
Luke|6|41|And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Luke|6|42|Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
Luke|6|43|For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.
Luke|6|44|For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
Luke|6|45|The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil {man} out of the evil {treasure} bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke|6|46|And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Luke|6|47|Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:
Luke|6|48|he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.
Luke|6|49|But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.
Luke|7|1|After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
Luke|7|2|And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.
Luke|7|3|And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.
Luke|7|4|And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him;
Luke|7|5|for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.
Luke|7|6|And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:
Luke|7|7|wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Luke|7|8|For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Luke|7|9|And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Luke|7|10|And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
Luke|7|11|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.
Luke|7|12|Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
Luke|7|13|And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
Luke|7|14|And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
Luke|7|15|And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
Luke|7|16|And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.
Luke|7|17|And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about.
Luke|7|18|And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
Luke|7|19|And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|20|And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|21|In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.
Luke|7|22|And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Luke|7|23|And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
Luke|7|24|And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Luke|7|25|But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
Luke|7|26|But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke|7|27|This is he of whom it is written,             Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,                   Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Luke|7|28|I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Luke|7|29|And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke|7|30|But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.
Luke|7|31|Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?
Luke|7|32|They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.
Luke|7|33|For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
Luke|7|34|The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
Luke|7|35|And wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke|7|36|And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
Luke|7|37|And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,
Luke|7|38|and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke|7|39|Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
Luke|7|40|And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.
Luke|7|41|A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.
Luke|7|42|When they had not {wherewith} to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?
Luke|7|43|Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
Luke|7|44|And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
Luke|7|45|Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke|7|46|My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke|7|47|Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, {the same} loveth little.
Luke|7|48|And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
Luke|7|49|And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?
Luke|7|50|And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
Luke|8|1|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,
Luke|8|2|and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke|8|3|and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.
Luke|8|4|And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:
Luke|8|5|The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.
Luke|8|6|And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
Luke|8|7|And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
Luke|8|8|And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|8|9|And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.
Luke|8|10|And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
Luke|8|11|Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke|8|12|And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
Luke|8|13|And those on the rock {are} they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luke|8|14|And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of {this} life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luke|8|15|And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.
Luke|8|16|And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.
Luke|8|17|For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor {anything} secret, that shall not be known and come to light.
Luke|8|18|Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.
Luke|8|19|And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.
Luke|8|20|And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
Luke|8|21|But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.
Luke|8|22|Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.
Luke|8|23|But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling {with water}, and were in jeopardy.
Luke|8|24|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke|8|25|And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?
Luke|8|26|And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luke|8|27|And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in {any} house, but in the tombs.
Luke|8|28|And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luke|8|29|For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.
Luke|8|30|And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.
Luke|8|31|And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.
Luke|8|32|Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.
Luke|8|33|And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.
Luke|8|34|And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
Luke|8|35|And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.
Luke|8|36|And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.
Luke|8|37|And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them, for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.
Luke|8|38|But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,
Luke|8|39|Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.
Luke|8|40|And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.
Luke|8|41|And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;
Luke|8|42|for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.
Luke|8|43|And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,
Luke|8|44|came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.
Luke|8|45|And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush {thee}.
Luke|8|46|But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.
Luke|8|47|And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luke|8|48|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
Luke|8|49|While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s {house}, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
Luke|8|50|But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.
Luke|8|51|And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.
Luke|8|52|And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.
Luke|8|53|And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
Luke|8|54|But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.
Luke|8|55|And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that {something} be given her to eat.
Luke|8|56|And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.
Luke|9|1|And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
Luke|9|2|And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luke|9|3|And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.
Luke|9|4|And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.
Luke|9|5|And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luke|9|6|And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.
Luke|9|7|Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;
Luke|9|8|and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
Luke|9|9|And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
Luke|9|10|And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.
Luke|9|11|But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.
Luke|9|12|And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
Luke|9|13|But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.
Luke|9|14|For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
Luke|9|15|And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Luke|9|16|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luke|9|17|And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
Luke|9|18|And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
Luke|9|19|And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others {say}, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
Luke|9|20|And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
Luke|9|21|But he charged them, and commanded {them} to tell this to no man;
Luke|9|22|saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Luke|9|23|And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
Luke|9|24|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
Luke|9|25|For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
Luke|9|26|For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and {the glory} of the Father, and of the holy angels.
Luke|9|27|But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|28|And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
Luke|9|29|And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment {became} white {and} dazzling.
Luke|9|30|And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;
Luke|9|31|who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke|9|32|Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luke|9|33|And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
Luke|9|34|And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
Luke|9|35|And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.
Luke|9|36|And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
Luke|9|37|And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
Luke|9|38|And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:
Luke|9|39|and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.
Luke|9|40|And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
Luke|9|41|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.
Luke|9|42|And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare {him} grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
Luke|9|43|And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,
Luke|9|44|Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.
Luke|9|45|But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
Luke|9|46|And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
Luke|9|47|But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
Luke|9|48|and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
Luke|9|49|And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.
Luke|9|50|But Jesus said unto him, Forbid {him} not: for he that is not against you is for you.
Luke|9|51|And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luke|9|52|and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luke|9|53|And they did not receive him, because his face was {as though he were} going to Jerusalem.
Luke|9|54|And when his disciples James and John saw {this}, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?
Luke|9|55|But he turned, and rebuked them.
Luke|9|56|And they went to another village.
Luke|9|57|And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Luke|9|58|And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven {have} nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Luke|9|59|And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Luke|9|60|But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|61|And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.
Luke|9|62|But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luke|10|1|Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.
Luke|10|2|And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
Luke|10|3|Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Luke|10|4|Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.
Luke|10|5|And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace {be} to this house.
Luke|10|6|And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.
Luke|10|7|And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
Luke|10|8|And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
Luke|10|9|and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luke|10|10|But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,
Luke|10|11|Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.
Luke|10|12|I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Luke|10|13|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke|10|14|But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
Luke|10|15|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.
Luke|10|16|He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
Luke|10|17|And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.
Luke|10|18|And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.
Luke|10|19|Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.
Luke|10|20|Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
Luke|10|21|In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Luke|10|22|All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal {him}.
Luke|10|23|And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed {are} the eyes which see the things that ye see:
Luke|10|24|for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Luke|10|25|And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|10|26|And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
Luke|10|27|And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
Luke|10|28|And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
Luke|10|29|But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Luke|10|30|Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
Luke|10|31|And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|32|And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|33|But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
Luke|10|34|and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on {them} oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
Luke|10|35|And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.
Luke|10|36|Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?
Luke|10|37|And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
Luke|10|38|Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
Luke|10|39|And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.
Luke|10|40|But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
Luke|10|41|But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:
Luke|10|42|but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
Luke|11|1|And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
Luke|11|2|And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Luke|11|3|Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke|11|4|And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.
Luke|11|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
Luke|11|6|for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;
Luke|11|7|and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?
Luke|11|8|I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.
Luke|11|9|And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Luke|11|10|For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Luke|11|11|And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?
Luke|11|12|Or {if} he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
Luke|11|13|If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall {your} heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
Luke|11|14|And he was casting out a demon {that was} dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.
Luke|11|15|But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
Luke|11|16|And others, trying {him}, sought of him a sign from heaven.
Luke|11|17|But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house {divided} against a house falleth.
Luke|11|18|And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
Luke|11|19|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Luke|11|20|But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Luke|11|21|When the strong {man} fully armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace:
Luke|11|22|but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
Luke|11|23|He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Luke|11|24|The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out.
Luke|11|25|And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.
Luke|11|26|Then goeth he, and taketh {to him} seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
Luke|11|27|And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.
Luke|11|28|But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
Luke|11|29|And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
Luke|11|30|For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
Luke|11|31|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Luke|11|32|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Luke|11|33|No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light.
Luke|11|34|The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
Luke|11|35|Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.
Luke|11|36|If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.
Luke|11|37|Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
Luke|11|38|And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.
Luke|11|39|And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
Luke|11|40|Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?
Luke|11|41|But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.
Luke|11|42|But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Luke|11|43|Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.
Luke|11|44|Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over {them} know it not.
Luke|11|45|And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.
Luke|11|46|And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke|11|47|Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luke|11|48|So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build {their tombs}.
Luke|11|49|Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and {some} of them they shall kill and persecute;
Luke|11|50|that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
Luke|11|51|from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.
Luke|11|52|Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
Luke|11|53|And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon {him} vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;
Luke|11|54|laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.
Luke|12|1|In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke|12|2|But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Luke|12|3|Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke|12|4|And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Luke|12|5|But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Luke|12|6|Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
Luke|12|7|But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke|12|8|And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
Luke|12|9|but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
Luke|12|10|And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.
Luke|12|11|And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
Luke|12|12|for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.
Luke|12|13|And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.
Luke|12|14|But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
Luke|12|15|And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
Luke|12|16|And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
Luke|12|17|and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits?
Luke|12|18|And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods.
Luke|12|19|And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
Luke|12|20|But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?
Luke|12|21|So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
Luke|12|22|And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for {your} life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
Luke|12|23|For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.
Luke|12|24|Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds!
Luke|12|25|And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?
Luke|12|26|If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest?
Luke|12|27|Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Luke|12|28|But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more {shall he clothe} you, O ye of little faith?
Luke|12|29|And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
Luke|12|30|For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke|12|31|Yet seek ye his kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you.
Luke|12|32|Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
Luke|12|33|Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth.
Luke|12|34|For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Luke|12|35|Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;
Luke|12|36|and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him.
Luke|12|37|Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them.
Luke|12|38|And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find {them} so blessed are those {servants}.
Luke|12|39|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through.
Luke|12|40|Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Luke|12|41|And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all?
Luke|12|42|And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?
Luke|12|43|Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Luke|12|44|Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
Luke|12|45|But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
Luke|12|46|the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.
Luke|12|47|And that servant, who knew his lord’s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many {stripes};
Luke|12|48|but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few {stripes}. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.
Luke|12|49|I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled?
Luke|12|50|But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke|12|51|Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
Luke|12|52|for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
Luke|12|53|They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.
Luke|12|54|And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|55|And when {ye see} a south wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|56|Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?
Luke|12|57|And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
Luke|12|58|For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison.
Luke|12|59|I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.
Luke|13|1|Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke|13|2|And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things?
Luke|13|3|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.
Luke|13|4|Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
Luke|13|5|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Luke|13|6|And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none.
Luke|13|7|And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground?
Luke|13|8|And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
Luke|13|9|and if it bear fruit thenceforth, {well}; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.
Luke|13|10|And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.
Luke|13|11|And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up.
Luke|13|12|And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
Luke|13|13|And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
Luke|13|14|And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.
Luke|13|15|But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
Luke|13|16|And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, {these} eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?
Luke|13|17|And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke|13|18|He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?
Luke|13|19|It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.
Luke|13|20|And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke|13|21|It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
Luke|13|22|And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.
Luke|13|23|And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them,
Luke|13|24|Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
Luke|13|25|When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;
Luke|13|26|then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;
Luke|13|27|and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
Luke|13|28|There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.
Luke|13|29|And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
Luke|13|30|And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
Luke|13|31|In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.
Luke|13|32|And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third {day} I am perfected.
Luke|13|33|Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the {day} following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
Luke|13|34|O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen {gathereth} her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!
Luke|13|35|Behold, your house is left unto you {desolate}: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Luke|14|1|And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
Luke|14|2|And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy.
Luke|14|3|And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?
Luke|14|4|But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.
Luke|14|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?
Luke|14|6|And they could not answer again unto these things.
Luke|14|7|And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them,
Luke|14|8|When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him,
Luke|14|9|and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.
Luke|14|10|But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.
Luke|14|11|For everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke|14|12|And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.
Luke|14|13|But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
Luke|14|14|and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not {wherewith} to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.
Luke|14|15|And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke|14|16|But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many:
Luke|14|17|and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for {all} things are now ready.
Luke|14|18|And they all with one {consent} began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|19|And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|20|And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
Luke|14|21|And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.
Luke|14|22|And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.
Luke|14|23|And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain {them} to come in, that my house may be filled.
Luke|14|24|For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.
Luke|14|25|Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them,
Luke|14|26|If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|27|Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|28|For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have {wherewith} to complete it?
Luke|14|29|Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,
Luke|14|30|saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
Luke|14|31|Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
Luke|14|32|Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.
Luke|14|33|So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|34|Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
Luke|14|35|It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: {men} cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|15|1|Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.
Luke|15|2|And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
Luke|15|3|And he spake unto them this parable, saying,
Luke|15|4|What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
Luke|15|5|And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Luke|15|6|And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
Luke|15|7|I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, {more} than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.
Luke|15|8|Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?
Luke|15|9|And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.
Luke|15|10|Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
Luke|15|11|And he said, A certain man had two sons:
Luke|15|12|and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of {thy} substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.
Luke|15|13|And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.
Luke|15|14|And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
Luke|15|15|And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke|15|16|And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke|15|17|But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!
Luke|15|18|I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:
Luke|15|19|I am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
Luke|15|20|And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
Luke|15|21|And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
Luke|15|22|But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
Luke|15|23|and bring the fatted calf, {and} kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:
Luke|15|24|for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
Luke|15|25|Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
Luke|15|26|And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.
Luke|15|27|And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
Luke|15|28|But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.
Luke|15|29|But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and {yet} thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
Luke|15|30|but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.
Luke|15|31|And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.
Luke|15|32|But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive {again}; and {was} lost, and is found.
Luke|16|1|And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.
Luke|16|2|And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.
Luke|16|3|And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
Luke|16|4|I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
Luke|16|5|And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
Luke|16|6|And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.
Luke|16|7|Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.
Luke|16|8|And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.
Luke|16|9|And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
Luke|16|10|He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.
Luke|16|11|If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true {riches}?
Luke|16|12|And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?
Luke|16|13|No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Luke|16|14|And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.
Luke|16|15|And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
Luke|16|16|The law and the prophets {were} until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.
Luke|16|17|But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.
Luke|16|18|Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.
Luke|16|19|Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:
Luke|16|20|and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,
Luke|16|21|and desiring to be fed with the {crumbs} that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs come and licked his sores.
Luke|16|22|And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.
Luke|16|23|And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke|16|24|And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.
Luke|16|25|But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish.
Luke|16|26|And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.
Luke|16|27|And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;
Luke|16|28|for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
Luke|16|29|But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
Luke|16|30|And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.
Luke|16|31|And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.
Luke|17|1|And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come!
Luke|17|2|It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Luke|17|3|Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
Luke|17|4|And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
Luke|17|5|And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
Luke|17|6|And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
Luke|17|7|But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat;
Luke|17|8|and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
Luke|17|9|Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded?
Luke|17|10|Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
Luke|17|11|And it came to pass, as they were on their way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
Luke|17|12|And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:
Luke|17|13|and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
Luke|17|14|And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.
Luke|17|15|And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;
Luke|17|16|and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
Luke|17|17|And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
Luke|17|18|Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?
Luke|17|19|And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
Luke|17|20|And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
Luke|17|21|neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.
Luke|17|22|And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.
Luke|17|23|And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after {them}:
Luke|17|24|for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.
Luke|17|25|But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
Luke|17|26|And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
Luke|17|27|They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
Luke|17|28|Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
Luke|17|29|but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:
Luke|17|30|after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
Luke|17|31|In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.
Luke|17|32|Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke|17|33|Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose {his life} shall preserve it.
Luke|17|34|I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
Luke|17|35|There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
Luke|17|36|{There shall be two men in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.}
Luke|17|37|And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body {is}, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.
Luke|18|1|And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;
Luke|18|2|saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man:
Luke|18|3|and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
Luke|18|4|And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
Luke|18|5|yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.
Luke|18|6|And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.
Luke|18|7|And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and {yet} he is longsuffering over them?
Luke|18|8|I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
Luke|18|9|And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:
Luke|18|10|Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
Luke|18|11|The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
Luke|18|12|I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.
Luke|18|13|But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.
Luke|18|14|I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke|18|15|And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
Luke|18|16|But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|17|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
Luke|18|18|And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|18|19|And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, {even} God.
Luke|18|20|Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.
Luke|18|21|And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.
Luke|18|22|And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Luke|18|23|But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.
Luke|18|24|And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Luke|18|25|For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|26|And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?
Luke|18|27|But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
Luke|18|28|And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.
Luke|18|29|And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,
Luke|18|30|who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.
Luke|18|31|And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.
Luke|18|32|For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:
Luke|18|33|and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Luke|18|34|And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.
Luke|18|35|And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
Luke|18|36|and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.
Luke|18|37|And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
Luke|18|38|And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke|18|39|And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke|18|40|And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
Luke|18|41|What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
Luke|18|42|And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole.
Luke|18|43|And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
Luke|19|1|And he entered and was passing through Jericho.
Luke|19|2|And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.
Luke|19|3|And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.
Luke|19|4|And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
Luke|19|5|And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.
Luke|19|6|And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
Luke|19|7|And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.
Luke|19|8|And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.
Luke|19|9|And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
Luke|19|10|For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke|19|11|And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and {because} they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.
Luke|19|12|He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
Luke|19|13|And he called ten servants of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye {herewith} till I come.
Luke|19|14|But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us.
Luke|19|15|And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.
Luke|19|16|And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more.
Luke|19|17|And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.
Luke|19|18|And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds.
Luke|19|19|And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities.
Luke|19|20|And another came, saying, Lord, behold, {here is} thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin:
Luke|19|21|for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow.
Luke|19|22|He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;
Luke|19|23|then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?
Luke|19|24|And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.
Luke|19|25|And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
Luke|19|26|I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.
Luke|19|27|But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
Luke|19|28|And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke|19|29|And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
Luke|19|30|saying, Go your way into the village over against {you}; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.
Luke|19|31|And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke|19|32|And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.
Luke|19|33|And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
Luke|19|34|And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke|19|35|And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.
Luke|19|36|And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
Luke|19|37|And as he was now drawing nigh, {even} at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;
Luke|19|38|saying, Blessed {is} the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
Luke|19|39|And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.
Luke|19|40|And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
Luke|19|41|And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,
Luke|19|42|saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
Luke|19|43|For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
Luke|19|44|and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
Luke|19|45|And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,
Luke|19|46|saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.
Luke|19|47|And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:
Luke|19|48|and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.
Luke|20|1|And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;
Luke|20|2|and they spake, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
Luke|20|3|And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me:
Luke|20|4|The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
Luke|20|5|And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him?
Luke|20|6|But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
Luke|20|7|And they answered, that they knew not whence {it was}.
Luke|20|8|And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Luke|20|9|And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.
Luke|20|10|And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
Luke|20|11|And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
Luke|20|12|And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.
Luke|20|13|And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.
Luke|20|14|But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
Luke|20|15|And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
Luke|20|16|He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
Luke|20|17|But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written,             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner?
Luke|20|18|Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Luke|20|19|And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.
Luke|20|20|And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
Luke|20|21|And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person {of any}, but of a truth teachest the way of God:
Luke|20|22|Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Luke|20|23|But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,
Luke|20|24|Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.
Luke|20|25|And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.
Luke|20|26|And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
Luke|20|27|And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;
Luke|20|28|and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Luke|20|29|There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;
Luke|20|30|and the second:
Luke|20|31|and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
Luke|20|32|Afterward the woman also died.
Luke|20|33|In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
Luke|20|34|And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
Luke|20|35|but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke|20|36|for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
Luke|20|37|But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in {the place concerning} the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke|20|38|Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
Luke|20|39|And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
Luke|20|40|For they durst not any more ask him any question.
Luke|20|41|And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?
Luke|20|42|For David himself saith in the book of Psalms,             The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,
Luke|20|43|Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Luke|20|44|David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?
Luke|20|45|And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,
Luke|20|46|Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;
Luke|20|47|who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.
Luke|21|1|And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke|21|2|And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke|21|3|And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all:
Luke|21|4|for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.
Luke|21|5|And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said,
Luke|21|6|As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Luke|21|7|And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these things be? and what {shall be} the sign when these things are about to come to pass?
Luke|21|8|And he said, Take heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am {he}; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them.
Luke|21|9|And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.
Luke|21|10|Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
Luke|21|11|and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.
Luke|21|12|But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|13|It shall turn out unto you for a testimony.
Luke|21|14|Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer:
Luke|21|15|for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay.
Luke|21|16|But ye shall be delivered up even by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and {some} of you shall they cause to be put to death.
Luke|21|17|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|18|And not a hair of your head shall perish.
Luke|21|19|In your patience ye shall win your souls.
Luke|21|20|But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.
Luke|21|21|Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein.
Luke|21|22|For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
Luke|21|23|Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people.
Luke|21|24|And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
Luke|21|25|And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows;
Luke|21|26|men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
Luke|21|27|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke|21|28|But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.
Luke|21|29|And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees:
Luke|21|30|when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh.
Luke|21|31|Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.
Luke|21|32|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished.
Luke|21|33|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke|21|34|But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare:
Luke|21|35|for {so} shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.
Luke|21|36|But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
Luke|21|37|And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet.
Luke|21|38|And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
Luke|22|1|Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
Luke|22|2|And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.
Luke|22|3|And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
Luke|22|4|And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them.
Luke|22|5|And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
Luke|22|6|And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Luke|22|7|And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed.
Luke|22|8|And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat.
Luke|22|9|And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready?
Luke|22|10|And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.
Luke|22|11|And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Luke|22|12|And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke|22|13|And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Luke|22|14|And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.
Luke|22|15|And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
Luke|22|16|for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke|22|17|And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
Luke|22|18|for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
Luke|22|19|And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Luke|22|20|And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, {even} that which is poured out for you.
Luke|22|21|But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
Luke|22|22|For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!
Luke|22|23|And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
Luke|22|24|And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.
Luke|22|25|And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.
Luke|22|26|But ye {shall} not {be} so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
Luke|22|27|For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
Luke|22|28|But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;
Luke|22|29|and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,
