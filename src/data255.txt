Ezra|8|19|and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
Ezra|8|20|and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.
Ezra|8|21|Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
Ezra|8|22|For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
Ezra|8|23|So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
Ezra|8|24|Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
Ezra|8|25|and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:
Ezra|8|26|I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;
Ezra|8|27|and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.
Ezra|8|28|And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.
Ezra|8|29|Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ {houses} of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|8|30|So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
Ezra|8|31|Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth {day} of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.
Ezra|8|32|And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
Ezra|8|33|And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;
Ezra|8|34|the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra|8|35|The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|8|36|And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.
Ezra|9|1|Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, {doing} according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
Ezra|9|2|For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
Ezra|9|3|And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
Ezra|9|4|Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.
Ezra|9|5|And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;
Ezra|9|6|and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.
Ezra|9|7|Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
Ezra|9|8|And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
Ezra|9|9|For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
Ezra|9|10|And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
Ezra|9|11|which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:
Ezra|9|12|now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
Ezra|9|13|And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,
Ezra|9|14|shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
Ezra|9|15|O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this.
Ezra|10|1|Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
Ezra|10|2|And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
Ezra|10|3|Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
Ezra|10|4|Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
Ezra|10|5|Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.
Ezra|10|6|Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and {when} he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.
Ezra|10|7|And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
Ezra|10|8|and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
Ezra|10|9|Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth {day} of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
Ezra|10|10|And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.
Ezra|10|11|Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
Ezra|10|12|Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.
Ezra|10|13|But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
Ezra|10|14|Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
Ezra|10|15|Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this {matter}: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
Ezra|10|16|And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, {with} certain heads of fathers’ {houses}, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
Ezra|10|17|And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
Ezra|10|18|And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: {namely}, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
Ezra|10|19|And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, {they offered} a ram of the flock for their guilt.
Ezra|10|20|And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
Ezra|10|21|And of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
Ezra|10|22|And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
Ezra|10|23|And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
Ezra|10|24|And of the singers: Eliashib. And of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
Ezra|10|25|And of Israel: Of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
Ezra|10|26|And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.
Ezra|10|27|And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
Ezra|10|28|And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.
Ezra|10|29|And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, Jeremoth.
Ezra|10|30|And of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
Ezra|10|31|And {of} the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
Ezra|10|32|Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah.
Ezra|10|33|Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei.
Ezra|10|34|Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
Ezra|10|35|Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
Ezra|10|36|Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
Ezra|10|37|Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu,
Ezra|10|38|and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
Ezra|10|39|and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
Ezra|10|40|Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
Ezra|10|41|Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
Ezra|10|42|Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.
Ezra|10|43|Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.
Ezra|10|44|All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
Leviticus|1|1|And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus|1|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, {even} of the herd and of the flock.
Leviticus|1|3|If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|4|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Leviticus|1|5|And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|1|6|And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus|1|7|And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;
Leviticus|1|8|and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|9|but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|10|And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.
Leviticus|1|11|And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|1|12|And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|13|but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|14|And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.
Leviticus|1|15|And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;
Leviticus|1|16|and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:
Leviticus|1|17|and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, {but} shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|1|And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
Leviticus|2|2|and he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn {it as} the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah:
Leviticus|2|3|and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus|2|4|And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
Leviticus|2|5|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
Leviticus|2|6|Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.
