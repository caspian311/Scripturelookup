1 Kings|9|24|But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which {Solomon} had built for her: then did he build Millo.
1 Kings|9|25|And three times a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, {upon the altar} that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.
1 Kings|9|26|And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1 Kings|9|27|And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
1 Kings|9|28|And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
1 Kings|10|1|And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.
1 Kings|10|2|And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1 Kings|10|3|And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.
1 Kings|10|4|And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
1 Kings|10|5|and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
1 Kings|10|6|And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|7|Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
1 Kings|10|8|Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, {and} that hear thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|9|Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.
1 Kings|10|10|And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1 Kings|10|11|And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.
1 Kings|10|12|And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.
1 Kings|10|13|And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
1 Kings|10|14|Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
1 Kings|10|15|besides {that which} the traders {brought}, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.
1 Kings|10|16|And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred {shekels} of gold went to one buckler.
1 Kings|10|17|And {he made} three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1 Kings|10|18|Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
1 Kings|10|19|There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
1 Kings|10|20|And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1 Kings|10|21|And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|10|22|For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1 Kings|10|23|So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
1 Kings|10|24|And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1 Kings|10|25|And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1 Kings|10|26|And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1 Kings|10|27|And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
1 Kings|10|28|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
1 Kings|10|29|And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
1 Kings|11|1|Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
1 Kings|11|2|of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
1 Kings|11|3|And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
1 Kings|11|4|For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.
1 Kings|11|5|For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
1 Kings|11|6|And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|7|Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
1 Kings|11|8|And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1 Kings|11|9|And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,
1 Kings|11|10|and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.
1 Kings|11|11|Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
1 Kings|11|12|Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1 Kings|11|13|Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.
1 Kings|11|14|And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
1 Kings|11|15|For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom
1 Kings|11|16|(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
1 Kings|11|17|that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
1 Kings|11|18|And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
1 Kings|11|19|And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
1 Kings|11|20|And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
1 Kings|11|21|And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
1 Kings|11|22|Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.
1 Kings|11|23|And God raised up {another} adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
1 Kings|11|24|And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them {of Zobah}: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
1 Kings|11|25|And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad {did}: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
1 Kings|11|26|And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.
1 Kings|11|27|And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.
1 Kings|11|28|And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
1 Kings|11|29|And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now {Ahijah} had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
1 Kings|11|30|And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.
1 Kings|11|31|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee
1 Kings|11|32|(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);
1 Kings|11|33|because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and {to keep} my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|34|Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
1 Kings|11|35|but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
1 Kings|11|36|And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
1 Kings|11|37|And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
1 Kings|11|38|And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
1 Kings|11|39|And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1 Kings|11|40|Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1 Kings|11|41|Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1 Kings|11|42|And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings|11|43|And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|12|1|And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings|12|2|And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,
1 Kings|12|3|and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
1 Kings|12|4|Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1 Kings|12|5|And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
1 Kings|12|6|And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
1 Kings|12|7|And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
1 Kings|12|8|But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.
1 Kings|12|9|And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?
1 Kings|12|10|And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
1 Kings|12|11|And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings|12|12|So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1 Kings|12|13|And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
1 Kings|12|14|and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings|12|15|So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings|12|16|And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
1 Kings|12|17|But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1 Kings|12|18|Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings|12|19|So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1 Kings|12|20|And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1 Kings|12|21|And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1 Kings|12|22|But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1 Kings|12|23|Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
