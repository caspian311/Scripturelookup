2 Chronicles|2|10|And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2 Chronicles|2|11|Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.
2 Chronicles|2|12|Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|13|And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,
2 Chronicles|2|14|the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any device; that there may be {a place} appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.
2 Chronicles|2|15|Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
2 Chronicles|2|16|and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|2|17|And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
2 Chronicles|2|18|And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people at work.
2 Chronicles|3|1|Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where {Jehovah} appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 Chronicles|3|2|And he began to build in the second {day} of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles|3|3|Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|4|And the porch that was before {the house}, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
2 Chronicles|3|5|And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.
2 Chronicles|3|6|And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles|3|7|He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
2 Chronicles|3|8|And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2 Chronicles|3|9|And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|10|And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|11|And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one {cherub} was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was {likewise} five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|12|And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits {also}, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|13|The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
2 Chronicles|3|14|And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.
2 Chronicles|3|15|Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|16|And he made chains in the oracle, and put {them} on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
2 Chronicles|3|17|And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
2 Chronicles|4|1|Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
2 Chronicles|4|2|Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
2 Chronicles|4|3|And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
2 Chronicles|4|4|It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
2 Chronicles|4|5|And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.
2 Chronicles|4|6|He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2 Chronicles|4|7|And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
2 Chronicles|4|8|He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
2 Chronicles|4|9|Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
2 Chronicles|4|10|And he set the sea on the right side {of the house} eastward, toward the south.
2 Chronicles|4|11|And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:
2 Chronicles|4|12|the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
2 Chronicles|4|13|and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.
2 Chronicles|4|14|He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;
2 Chronicles|4|15|one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
2 Chronicles|4|16|The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.
2 Chronicles|4|17|In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles|4|18|Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2 Chronicles|4|19|And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;
2 Chronicles|4|20|and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
2 Chronicles|4|21|and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;
2 Chronicles|4|22|and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, {to wit}, of the temple, were of gold.
2 Chronicles|5|1|Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|5|2|Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ {houses} of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
2 Chronicles|5|3|nd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king at the feast, which was {in} the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|5|4|And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;
2 Chronicles|5|5|and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.
2 Chronicles|5|6|And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
2 Chronicles|5|7|And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
2 Chronicles|5|8|For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
2 Chronicles|5|9|And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.
2 Chronicles|5|10|There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put {there} at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|5|11|And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;
2 Chronicles|5|12|also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)
2 Chronicles|5|13|it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, {saying}, For he is good; for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|5|14|so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles|6|1|Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
2 Chronicles|6|2|But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.
2 Chronicles|6|3|And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
2 Chronicles|6|4|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,
2 Chronicles|6|5|Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
2 Chronicles|6|6|but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|7|Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|8|But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
2 Chronicles|6|9|nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
2 Chronicles|6|10|And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|11|And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|12|And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands
2 Chronicles|6|13|(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)
2 Chronicles|6|14|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;
2 Chronicles|6|15|who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
2 Chronicles|6|16|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.
2 Chronicles|6|17|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.
2 Chronicles|6|18|But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!
2 Chronicles|6|19|Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;
2 Chronicles|6|20|that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
2 Chronicles|6|21|And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive.
2 Chronicles|6|22|If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come {and} swear before thine altar in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|23|then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
2 Chronicles|6|24|And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|25|then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|26|When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:
2 Chronicles|6|27|then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
2 Chronicles|6|28|If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;
2 Chronicles|6|29|what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|30|then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)
2 Chronicles|6|31|that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|32|Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|33|then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
2 Chronicles|6|34|If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
2 Chronicles|6|35|then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2 Chronicles|6|36|If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;
2 Chronicles|6|37|yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
2 Chronicles|6|38|if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
