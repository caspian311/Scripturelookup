Luke|22|30|that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke|22|31|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:
Luke|22|32|but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.
Luke|22|33|And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.
Luke|22|34|And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
Luke|22|35|And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.
Luke|22|36|And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
Luke|22|37|For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.
Luke|22|38|And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
Luke|22|39|And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.
Luke|22|40|And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|41|And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,
Luke|22|42|saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
Luke|22|43|And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
Luke|22|44|And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
Luke|22|45|And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,
Luke|22|46|and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|47|While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
Luke|22|48|But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
Luke|22|49|And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
Luke|22|50|And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.
Luke|22|51|But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye {them} thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Luke|22|52|And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?
Luke|22|53|When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
Luke|22|54|And they seized him, and led him {away}, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.
Luke|22|55|And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.
Luke|22|56|And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light {of the fire}, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.
Luke|22|57|But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.
Luke|22|58|And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art {one} of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.
Luke|22|59|And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.
Luke|22|60|But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
Luke|22|61|And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.
Luke|22|62|And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke|22|63|And the men that held {Jesus} mocked him, and beat him.
Luke|22|64|And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?
Luke|22|65|And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.
Luke|22|66|And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,
Luke|22|67|If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
Luke|22|68|and if I ask {you}, ye will not answer.
Luke|22|69|But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Luke|22|70|And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
Luke|22|71|And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
Luke|23|1|And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.
Luke|23|2|And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.
Luke|23|3|And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.
Luke|23|4|And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.
Luke|23|5|But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.
Luke|23|6|But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
Luke|23|7|And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.
Luke|23|8|Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
Luke|23|9|And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke|23|10|And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Luke|23|11|And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.
Luke|23|12|And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
Luke|23|13|And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke|23|14|and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
Luke|23|15|no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.
Luke|23|16|I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
Luke|23|17|{Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.}
Luke|23|18|But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --
Luke|23|19|one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
Luke|23|20|And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;
Luke|23|21|but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
Luke|23|22|And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.
Luke|23|23|But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
Luke|23|24|And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.
Luke|23|25|And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
Luke|23|26|And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.
Luke|23|27|And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
Luke|23|28|But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
Luke|23|29|For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
Luke|23|30|Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke|23|31|For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
Luke|23|32|And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
Luke|23|33|And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
Luke|23|34|And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.
Luke|23|35|And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.
Luke|23|36|And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,
Luke|23|37|and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke|23|38|And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke|23|39|And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.
Luke|23|40|But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke|23|41|And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke|23|42|And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.
Luke|23|43|And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
Luke|23|44|And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
Luke|23|45|the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke|23|46|And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.
Luke|23|47|And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
Luke|23|48|And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.
Luke|23|49|And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
Luke|23|50|And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man
Luke|23|51|(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), {a man} of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:
Luke|23|52|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke|23|53|And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.
Luke|23|54|And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke|23|55|And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.
Luke|23|56|And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke|24|1|But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Luke|24|2|And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
Luke|24|3|And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke|24|4|And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:
Luke|24|5|and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
Luke|24|6|He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Luke|24|7|saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
Luke|24|8|And they remembered his words,
Luke|24|9|and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
Luke|24|10|Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the {mother} of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.
Luke|24|11|And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.
Luke|24|12|But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.
Luke|24|13|And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|14|And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.
Luke|24|15|And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
Luke|24|16|But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
Luke|24|17|And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke|24|18|And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?
Luke|24|19|And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
Luke|24|20|and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
Luke|24|21|But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.
Luke|24|22|Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;
Luke|24|23|and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Luke|24|24|And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
Luke|24|25|And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
Luke|24|26|Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?
Luke|24|27|And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
Luke|24|28|And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.
Luke|24|29|And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.
Luke|24|30|And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking {it} he gave to them.
Luke|24|31|And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
Luke|24|32|And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?
Luke|24|33|And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
Luke|24|34|saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
Luke|24|35|And they rehearsed the things {that happened} in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke|24|36|And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace {be} unto you.
Luke|24|37|But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.
Luke|24|38|And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?
Luke|24|39|See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.
Luke|24|40|And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke|24|41|And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?
Luke|24|42|And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.
Luke|24|43|And he took it, and ate before them.
Luke|24|44|And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.
Luke|24|45|Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;
Luke|24|46|and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;
Luke|24|47|and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|48|Ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke|24|49|And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.
Luke|24|50|And he led them out until {they were} over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
Luke|24|51|And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
Luke|24|52|And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
Luke|24|53|and were continually in the temple, blessing God.
Malachi|1|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.
Malachi|1|2|I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;
Malachi|1|3|but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and {gave} his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
Malachi|1|4|Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.
Malachi|1|5|And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
Malachi|1|6|A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
Malachi|1|7|Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.
Malachi|1|8|And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|9|And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|10|Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle {fire on} mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
Malachi|1|11|For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name {shall be} great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense {shall be} offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name {shall be} great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|12|But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.
Malachi|1|13|Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.
Malachi|1|14|But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.
Malachi|2|1|And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
Malachi|2|2|If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.
Malachi|2|3|Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it.
Malachi|2|4|And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|5|My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.
Malachi|2|6|The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.
Malachi|2|7|For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|8|But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|9|Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.
Malachi|2|10|Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
Malachi|2|11|Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.
Malachi|2|12|Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|13|And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.
Malachi|2|14|Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
Malachi|2|15|And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
Malachi|2|16|For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
Malachi|2|17|Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of justice?
Malachi|3|1|Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|2|But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap:
Malachi|3|3|and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.
Malachi|3|4|Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
Malachi|3|5|And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner {from his right}, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|6|For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
Malachi|3|7|From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?
Malachi|3|8|Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
Malachi|3|9|Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.
Malachi|3|10|Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough {to receive it}.
Malachi|3|11|And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|12|And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|13|Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?
Malachi|3|14|Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
Malachi|3|15|And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.
Malachi|3|16|Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.
Malachi|3|17|And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, {even} mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
Malachi|3|18|Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
Malachi|4|1|For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
Malachi|4|2|But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.
Malachi|4|3|And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|4|4|Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
Malachi|4|5|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.
Malachi|4|6|And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
Zechariah|1|1|In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
Zechariah|1|2|Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.
Zechariah|1|3|Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|1|4|Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|1|5|Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
Zechariah|1|6|But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
Zechariah|1|7|Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
Zechariah|1|8|I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
Zechariah|1|9|Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.
Zechariah|1|10|And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
Zechariah|1|11|And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
Zechariah|1|12|Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
Zechariah|1|13|And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me with good words, {even} comfortable words.
Zechariah|1|14|So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
Zechariah|1|15|And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
Zechariah|1|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|17|Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|18|And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.
Zechariah|1|19|And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|20|And Jehovah showed me four smiths.
Zechariah|1|21|Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
Zechariah|2|1|And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah|2|2|Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
Zechariah|2|3|And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
Zechariah|2|4|and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
Zechariah|2|5|For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
Zechariah|2|6|Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|2|7|Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
Zechariah|2|8|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
Zechariah|2|9|For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.
Zechariah|2|10|Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|2|11|And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee.
Zechariah|2|12|And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah|2|13|Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
Zechariah|3|1|And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
Zechariah|3|2|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
Zechariah|3|3|Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
Zechariah|3|4|And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.
Zechariah|3|5|And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.
Zechariah|3|6|And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,
Zechariah|3|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.
Zechariah|3|8|Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
Zechariah|3|9|For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
Zechariah|3|10|In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.
Zechariah|4|1|And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
Zechariah|4|2|And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
Zechariah|4|3|and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
Zechariah|4|4|And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
Zechariah|4|5|Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Zechariah|4|6|Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|4|7|Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel {thou shalt become} a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.
Zechariah|4|8|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|4|9|The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.
Zechariah|4|10|For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; {these are} the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Zechariah|4|11|Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
Zechariah|4|12|And I answered the second time, and said unto him, What are these two olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden {oil} out of themselves?
Zechariah|4|13|And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Zechariah|4|14|Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
Zechariah|5|1|Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.
Zechariah|5|2|And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
Zechariah|5|3|Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it.
Zechariah|5|4|I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
Zechariah|5|5|Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
Zechariah|5|6|And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land
Zechariah|5|7|(and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
Zechariah|5|8|And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
Zechariah|5|9|Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.
Zechariah|5|10|Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
Zechariah|5|11|And he said unto me, To build her a house in the land of Shinar: and when it is prepared, she shall be set there in her own place.
Zechariah|6|1|And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
Zechariah|6|2|In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
Zechariah|6|3|and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.
Zechariah|6|4|Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?
Zechariah|6|5|And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
Zechariah|6|6|{The chariot} wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.
Zechariah|6|7|And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
Zechariah|6|8|Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
Zechariah|6|9|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|6|10|Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;
Zechariah|6|11|yea, take {of them} silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;
Zechariah|6|12|and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;
Zechariah|6|13|even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
Zechariah|6|14|And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.
Zechariah|6|15|And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you. And {this} shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.
Zechariah|7|1|And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah in the fourth {day} of the ninth month, even in Chislev.
Zechariah|7|2|Now {they of} Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah,
Zechariah|7|3|{and} to speak unto the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
Zechariah|7|4|Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying,
Zechariah|7|5|Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh {month}, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
Zechariah|7|6|And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
Zechariah|7|7|{Should ye} not {hear} the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?
Zechariah|7|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,
Zechariah|7|9|Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;
Zechariah|7|10|and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.
Zechariah|7|11|But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.
Zechariah|7|12|Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|7|13|And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;
Zechariah|7|14|but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
Zechariah|8|1|And the word of Jehovah of hosts came {to me}, saying,
Zechariah|8|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
Zechariah|8|3|Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.
Zechariah|8|4|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
Zechariah|8|5|And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
Zechariah|8|6|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
Zechariah|8|8|and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
Zechariah|8|9|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.
Zechariah|8|10|For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
Zechariah|8|11|But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|12|For {there shall be} the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
Zechariah|8|13|And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, {but} let your hands be strong.
Zechariah|8|14|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;
Zechariah|8|15|so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
Zechariah|8|16|These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;
Zechariah|8|17|and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|18|And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|8|19|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth {month}, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.
Zechariah|8|20|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: {It shall} yet {come to pass}, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;
Zechariah|8|21|and the inhabitants of one {city} shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.
Zechariah|8|22|Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|23|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days {it shall come to pass}, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.
Zechariah|9|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus {shall be} its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah);
Zechariah|9|2|and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
Zechariah|9|3|And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
Zechariah|9|4|Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
Zechariah|9|5|Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
Zechariah|9|6|And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah|9|7|And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
Zechariah|9|8|And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
Zechariah|9|9|Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
Zechariah|9|10|And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah|9|11|As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.
Zechariah|9|12|Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.
Zechariah|9|13|For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
Zechariah|9|14|And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
Zechariah|9|15|Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.
Zechariah|9|16|And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for {they shall be as} the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.
Zechariah|9|17|For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
Zechariah|10|1|Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, {even of} Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
Zechariah|10|2|For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
Zechariah|10|3|Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.
Zechariah|10|4|From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
Zechariah|10|5|And they shall be as mighty men, treading down {their enemies} in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
Zechariah|10|6|And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.
Zechariah|10|7|And {they of} Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.
Zechariah|10|8|I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.
Zechariah|10|9|And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
Zechariah|10|10|I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and {place} shall not be found for them.
Zechariah|10|11|And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
Zechariah|10|12|And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|1|Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
Zechariah|11|2|Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.
Zechariah|11|3|A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.
Zechariah|11|4|Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
Zechariah|11|5|whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.
Zechariah|11|6|For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
Zechariah|11|7|So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
Zechariah|11|8|And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
Zechariah|11|9|Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.
Zechariah|11|10|And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
Zechariah|11|11|And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|12|And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty {pieces} of silver.
Zechariah|11|13|And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty {pieces} of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|14|Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah|11|15|And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah|11|16|For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat {sheep}, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.
Zechariah|11|17|Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
Zechariah|12|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. {Thus} saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:
Zechariah|12|2|behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|3|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
Zechariah|12|4|In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.
Zechariah|12|5|And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.
Zechariah|12|6|In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and {they of} Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|7|Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.
Zechariah|12|8|In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.
Zechariah|12|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|10|And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
Zechariah|12|11|In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
Zechariah|12|12|And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|13|the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|14|all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
Zechariah|13|1|In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
Zechariah|13|2|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
Zechariah|13|3|And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
Zechariah|13|4|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
Zechariah|13|5|but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
Zechariah|13|6|And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
Zechariah|13|7|Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
Zechariah|13|8|And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
Zechariah|13|9|And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.
Zechariah|14|1|Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
Zechariah|14|2|For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah|14|3|Then shall Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
Zechariah|14|4|And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, {and there shall be} a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
Zechariah|14|5|And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee.
Zechariah|14|6|And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves:
Zechariah|14|7|but it shall be one day which is known unto Jehovah; not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.
Zechariah|14|8|And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.
Zechariah|14|9|And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one.
Zechariah|14|10|All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto the king’s wine-presses.
Zechariah|14|11|And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
Zechariah|14|12|And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
Zechariah|14|13|And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
Zechariah|14|14|And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
Zechariah|14|15|And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague.
Zechariah|14|16|And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|17|And it shall be, that whoso of {all} the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.
Zechariah|14|18|And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, neither {shall it be} upon them; there shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|19|This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|20|In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
Zechariah|14|21|Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil therein: and in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.
Lamentations|1|1|How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!                   She is become as a widow, that was great among the nations!                   She that was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!
Lamentations|1|2|She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks;                   Among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her:                   All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.
Lamentations|1|3|Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude;                   She dwelleth among the nations, she findeth no rest:                   All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.
Lamentations|1|4|The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly;                   All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:                   Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.
Lamentations|1|5|Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper;                   For Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:                   Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.
Lamentations|1|6|And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:                   Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,                   And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
Lamentations|1|7|Jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old:                   When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help her,                   The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.
Lamentations|1|8|Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an unclean thing;                   All that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:                   Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
Lamentations|1|9|Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered not her latter end;                   Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she hath no comforter:                   Behold, O Jehovah, my affliction; for the enemy hath magnified himself.
Lamentations|1|10|The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things:                   For she hath seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,                   Concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thine assembly.
Lamentations|1|11|All her people sigh, they seek bread;                   They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul:                   See, O Jehovah, and behold; for I am become abject.
Lamentations|1|12|Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?                   Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is brought upon me,                   Wherewith Jehovah hath afflicted {me} in the day of his fierce anger.
Lamentations|1|13|From on high hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them;                   He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back:                   He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.
Lamentations|1|14|The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;                   They are knit together, they are come up upon my neck; he hath made my strength to fail:                   The Lord hath delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.
Lamentations|1|15|The Lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me;                   He hath called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:                   The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.
Lamentations|1|16|For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water;                   Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me:                   My children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.
Lamentations|1|17|Zion spreadeth forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;                   Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob, that they that are round about him should be his adversaries:                   Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.
Lamentations|1|18|Jehovah is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:                   Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow:                   My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
Lamentations|1|19|I called for my lovers, {but} they deceived me:                   My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city,                   While they sought them food to refresh their souls.
Lamentations|1|20|Behold, O Jehovah; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;                   My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:                   Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.
Lamentations|1|21|They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me;                   All mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it:                   Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast proclaimed, and they shall be like unto me.
Lamentations|1|22|Let all their wickedness come before thee;                   And do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions:                   For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.
Lamentations|2|1|How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!                   He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,                   And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
Lamentations|2|2|The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied:                   He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;                   He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.
Lamentations|2|3|He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel;                   He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:                   And he hath burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
Lamentations|2|4|He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary,                   And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye:                   In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire.
Lamentations|2|5|The Lord is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel;                   He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds;                   And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
Lamentations|2|6|And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly:                   Jehovah hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,                   And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
Lamentations|2|7|The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary;                   He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:                   They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of a solemn assembly.
Lamentations|2|8|Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;                   He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying;                   And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
Lamentations|2|9|Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars:                   Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;                   Yea, her prophets find no vision from Jehovah.
Lamentations|2|10|The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence;                   They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth:                   The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
Lamentations|2|11|Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled;                   My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,                   Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
Lamentations|2|12|They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine?                   When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,                   When their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
Lamentations|2|13|What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?                   What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?                   For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
Lamentations|2|14|Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions;                   And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity,                   But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.
Lamentations|2|15|All that pass by clap their hands at thee;                   They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, {saying},                   Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
Lamentations|2|16|All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee;                   They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;                   Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
Lamentations|2|17|Jehovah hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old;                   He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:                   And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.
Lamentations|2|18|Their heart cried unto the Lord:                   O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night;                   Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
Lamentations|2|19|Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;                   Pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord:                   Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
Lamentations|2|20|See, O Jehovah, and behold to whom thou hast done thus!                   Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands?                   Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
Lamentations|2|21|The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;                   My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:                   Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, {and} not pitied.
Lamentations|2|22|Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side;                   And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of Jehovah’s anger:                   Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
Lamentations|3|1|I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
Lamentations|3|2|He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
Lamentations|3|3|Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.
Lamentations|3|4|My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
Lamentations|3|5|He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
Lamentations|3|6|He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
Lamentations|3|7|He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.
Lamentations|3|8|Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.
Lamentations|3|9|He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.
Lamentations|3|10|He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
Lamentations|3|11|He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.
Lamentations|3|12|He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
Lamentations|3|13|He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.
Lamentations|3|14|I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.
Lamentations|3|15|He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.
Lamentations|3|16|He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.
Lamentations|3|17|And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.
Lamentations|3|18|And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.
Lamentations|3|19|Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
Lamentations|3|20|My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.
Lamentations|3|21|This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.
Lamentations|3|22|{It is of} Jehovah’s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
Lamentations|3|23|They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.
Lamentations|3|24|Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
Lamentations|3|25|Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
Lamentations|3|26|It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.
Lamentations|3|27|It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
Lamentations|3|28|Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.
Lamentations|3|29|Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
Lamentations|3|30|Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.
Lamentations|3|31|For the Lord will not cast off for ever.
Lamentations|3|32|For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
Lamentations|3|33|For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
Lamentations|3|34|To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
Lamentations|3|35|To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
Lamentations|3|36|To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
Lamentations|3|37|Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
Lamentations|3|38|Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?
Lamentations|3|39|Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
Lamentations|3|40|Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.
Lamentations|3|41|Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
Lamentations|3|42|We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.
Lamentations|3|43|Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
Lamentations|3|44|Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations|3|45|Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
Lamentations|3|46|All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
Lamentations|3|47|Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.
Lamentations|3|48|Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations|3|49|Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
Lamentations|3|50|Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.
Lamentations|3|51|Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations|3|52|They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.
Lamentations|3|53|They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.
Lamentations|3|54|Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
Lamentations|3|55|I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.
Lamentations|3|56|Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
Lamentations|3|57|Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.
Lamentations|3|58|O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
Lamentations|3|59|O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.
Lamentations|3|60|Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
Lamentations|3|61|Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,
Lamentations|3|62|The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
Lamentations|3|63|Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
Lamentations|3|64|Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
Lamentations|3|65|Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.
Lamentations|3|66|Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.
Lamentations|4|1|How is the gold become dim! {how} is the most pure gold changed!                   The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
Lamentations|4|2|The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,                   How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
Lamentations|4|3|Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones:                   The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
Lamentations|4|4|The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:                   The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
Lamentations|4|5|They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:                   They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
Lamentations|4|6|For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,                   That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.
Lamentations|4|7|Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;                   They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.
Lamentations|4|8|Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:                   Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
Lamentations|4|9|They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger;                   For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.
Lamentations|4|10|The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;                   They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations|4|11|Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger;                   And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.
Lamentations|4|12|The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world,                   That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
Lamentations|4|13|{It is} because of the sins of her prophets, {and} the iniquities of her priests,                   That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
Lamentations|4|14|They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood,                   So that men cannot touch their garments.
Lamentations|4|15|Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not!                   When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn {here}.
Lamentations|4|16|The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them:                   They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
Lamentations|4|17|Our eyes do yet fail {in looking} for our vain help:                   In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
Lamentations|4|18|They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets:                   Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
Lamentations|4|19|Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens:                   They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
Lamentations|4|20|The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits;                   Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
Lamentations|4|21|Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz:                   The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
Lamentations|4|22|The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity:                   He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.
Lamentations|5|1|Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us:                   Behold, and see our reproach.

Lamentations|5|5|Our pursuers are upon our necks:                   We are weary, and have no rest.
Lamentations|5|6|We have given the hand to the Egyptians,                   And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
Lamentations|5|7|Our fathers sinned, and are not;                   And we have borne their iniquities.

Lamentations|5|10|Our skin is black like an oven,                   Because of the burning heat of famine.
Lamentations|5|11|They ravished the women in Zion,                   The virgins in the cities of Judah.
Lamentations|5|12|Princes were hanged up by their hand:                   The faces of elders were not honored.
Lamentations|5|13|The young men bare the mill;                   And the children stumbled under the wood.
Lamentations|5|14|The elders have ceased from the gate,                   The young men from their music.
Lamentations|5|15|The joy of our heart is ceased;                   Our dance is turned into mourning.

Lamentations|5|17|For this our heart is faint;                   For these things our eyes are dim;
Lamentations|5|18|For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate:                   The foxes walk upon it.
Lamentations|5|19|Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever;                   Thy throne is from generation to generation.
Lamentations|5|20|Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,                           {And} forsake us so long time?
Lamentations|5|21|Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned;                   Renew our days as of old.
Lamentations|5|22|But thou hast utterly rejected us;                   Thou art very wroth against us.
Proverbs|1|1|The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs|1|2|To know wisdom and instruction;                   To discern the words of understanding;
Proverbs|1|3|To receive instruction in wise dealing,                   In righteousness and justice and equity;
Proverbs|1|4|To give prudence to the simple,                   To the young man knowledge and discretion:
Proverbs|1|5|That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;                   And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:
Proverbs|1|6|To understand a proverb, and a figure,                   The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Proverbs|1|7|The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge;                           {But} the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs|1|8|My son, hear the instruction of thy father,                   And forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs|1|9|For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,                   And chains about thy neck.
Proverbs|1|10|My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.
Proverbs|1|11|If they say, Come with us,                   Let us lay wait for blood;                   Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;
Proverbs|1|12|Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,                   And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
Proverbs|1|13|We shall find all precious substance;                   We shall fill our houses with spoil;
Proverbs|1|14|Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;                   We will all have one purse:
Proverbs|1|15|My son, walk not thou in the way with them;                   Refrain thy foot from their path:
Proverbs|1|16|For their feet run to evil,                   And they make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs|1|17|For in vain is the net spread                   In the sight of any bird:
Proverbs|1|18|And these lay wait for their own blood;                   They lurk privily for their own lives.
Proverbs|1|19|So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;                   It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Proverbs|1|20|Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;                   She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
Proverbs|1|21|She crieth in the chief place of concourse;                   At the entrance of the gates,                   In the city, she uttereth her words:
Proverbs|1|22|How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?                   And scoffers delight them in scoffing,                   And fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs|1|23|Turn you at my reproof:                   Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;                   I will make known my words unto you.
Proverbs|1|24|Because I have called, and ye have refused;                   I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;
Proverbs|1|25|But ye have set at nought all my counsel,                   And would none of my reproof:
Proverbs|1|26|I also will laugh in {the day of} your calamity;                   I will mock when your fear cometh;
Proverbs|1|27|When your fear cometh as a storm,                   And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;                   When distress and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs|1|28|Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer;                   They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:
Proverbs|1|29|For that they hated knowledge,                   And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:
Proverbs|1|30|They would none of my counsel;                   They despised all my reproof.
Proverbs|1|31|Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,                   And be filled with their own devices.
Proverbs|1|32|For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them,                   And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.
Proverbs|1|33|But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,                   And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
Proverbs|2|1|My son, if thou wilt receive my words,                   And lay up my commandments with thee;
Proverbs|2|2|So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom,                   And apply thy heart to understanding;
Proverbs|2|3|Yea, if thou cry after discernment,                   And lift up thy voice for understanding;
Proverbs|2|4|If thou seek her as silver,                   And search for her as for hid treasures:
Proverbs|2|5|Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah,                   And find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs|2|6|For Jehovah giveth wisdom;                   Out of his mouth {cometh} knowledge and understanding:
Proverbs|2|7|He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright;                           {He is} a shield to them that walk in integrity;
Proverbs|2|8|That he may guard the paths of justice,                   And preserve the way of his saints.
Proverbs|2|9|Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,                   And equity, {yea}, every good path.
Proverbs|2|10|For wisdom shall enter into thy heart,                   And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
Proverbs|2|11|Discretion shall watch over thee;                   Understanding shall keep thee:
Proverbs|2|12|To deliver thee from the way of evil,                   From the men that speak perverse things;
Proverbs|2|13|Who forsake the paths of uprightness,                   To walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs|2|14|Who rejoice to do evil,                   And delight in the perverseness of evil;
Proverbs|2|15|Who are crooked in their ways,                   And wayward in their paths:
Proverbs|2|16|To deliver thee from the strange woman,                   Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
Proverbs|2|17|That forsaketh the friend of her youth,                   And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
Proverbs|2|18|For her house inclineth unto death,                   And her paths unto the dead;
Proverbs|2|19|None that go unto her return again,                   Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
Proverbs|2|20|That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,                   And keep the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs|2|21|For the upright shall dwell in the land,                   And the perfect shall remain in it.
Proverbs|2|22|But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,                   And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
Proverbs|3|1|My son, forget not my law;                   But let thy heart keep my commandments:
Proverbs|3|2|For length of days, and years of life,                   And peace, will they add to thee.
Proverbs|3|3|Let not kindness and truth forsake thee:                   Bind them about thy neck;                   Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
Proverbs|3|4|So shalt thou find favor and good understanding                   In the sight of God and man.
Proverbs|3|5|Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart,                   And lean not upon thine own understanding:
Proverbs|3|6|In all thy ways acknowledge him,                   And he will direct thy paths.
Proverbs|3|7|Be not wise in thine own eyes;                   Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:
Proverbs|3|8|It will be health to thy navel,                   And marrow to thy bones.
Proverbs|3|9|Honor Jehovah with thy substance,                   And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:
Proverbs|3|10|So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,                   And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
Proverbs|3|11|My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah;                   Neither be weary of his reproof:
Proverbs|3|12|For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth;                   Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Proverbs|3|13|Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,                   And the man that getteth understanding.
Proverbs|3|14|For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,                   And the profit thereof than fine gold.
Proverbs|3|15|She is more precious than rubies:                   And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.
Proverbs|3|16|Length of days is in her right hand;                   In her left hand are riches and honor.
Proverbs|3|17|Her ways are ways of pleasantness,                   And all her paths are peace.
Proverbs|3|18|She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:                   And happy is every one that retaineth her.
Proverbs|3|19|Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth;                   By understanding he established the heavens.
Proverbs|3|20|By his knowledge the depths were broken up,                   And the skies drop down the dew.
Proverbs|3|21|My son, let them not depart from thine eyes;                   Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Proverbs|3|22|So shall they be life unto thy soul,                   And grace to thy neck.
Proverbs|3|23|Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely,                   And thy foot shall not stumble.
Proverbs|3|24|When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:                   Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Proverbs|3|25|Be not afraid of sudden fear,                   Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
Proverbs|3|26|For Jehovah will be thy confidence,                   And will keep thy foot from being taken.
Proverbs|3|27|Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,                   When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
Proverbs|3|28|Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again,                   And to-morrow I will give;                   When thou hast it by thee.
Proverbs|3|29|Devise not evil against thy neighbor,                   Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Proverbs|3|30|Strive not with a man without cause,                   If he have done thee no harm.
Proverbs|3|31|Envy thou not the man of violence,                   And choose none of his ways.

Proverbs|3|33|The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked;                   But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
Proverbs|3|34|Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers;                   But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Proverbs|3|35|The wise shall inherit glory;                   But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Proverbs|4|1|Hear, {my} sons, the instruction of a father,                   And attend to know understanding:
Proverbs|4|2|For I give you good doctrine;                   Forsake ye not my law.
Proverbs|4|3|For I was a son unto my father,                   Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Proverbs|4|4|And he taught me, and said unto me:                   Let thy heart retain my words;                   Keep my commandments, and live;
Proverbs|4|5|Get wisdom, get understanding;                   Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
Proverbs|4|6|Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee;                   Love her, and she will keep thee.

Proverbs|4|9|She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace;                   A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.

Proverbs|4|14|Enter not into the path of the wicked,                   And walk not in the way of evil men.
Proverbs|4|15|Avoid it, pass not by it;                   Turn from it, and pass on.
Proverbs|4|16|For they sleep not, except they do evil;                   And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Proverbs|4|17|For they eat the bread of wickedness,                   And drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs|4|18|But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light,                   That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Proverbs|4|19|The way of the wicked is as darkness:                   They know not at what they stumble.
Proverbs|4|20|My son, attend to my words;                   Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Proverbs|4|21|Let them not depart from thine eyes;                   Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
Proverbs|4|22|For they are life unto those that find them,                   And health to all their flesh.
Proverbs|4|23|Keep thy heart with all diligence;                   For out of it are the issues of life.
Proverbs|4|24|Put away from thee a wayward mouth,                   And perverse lips put far from thee.
Proverbs|4|25|Let thine eyes look right on,                   And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

Proverbs|5|1|My son, attend unto my wisdom;                   Incline thine ear to my understanding:
Proverbs|5|2|That thou mayest preserve discretion,                   And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Proverbs|5|3|For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,                   And her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs|5|4|But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,                   Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs|5|5|Her feet go down to death;                   Her steps take hold on Sheol;
Proverbs|5|6|So that she findeth not the level path of life:                   Her ways are unstable, {and} she knoweth {it} not.
Proverbs|5|7|Now therefore, {my} sons, hearken unto me,                   And depart not from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs|5|8|Remove thy way far from her,                   And come not nigh the door of her house;
Proverbs|5|9|Lest thou give thine honor unto others,                   And thy years unto the cruel;
Proverbs|5|10|Lest strangers be filled with thy strength,                   And thy labors {be} in the house of an alien,
Proverbs|5|11|And thou mourn at thy latter end,                   When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Proverbs|5|12|And say, How have I hated instruction,                   And my heart despised reproof;
Proverbs|5|13|Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,                   Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Proverbs|5|14|I was well-nigh in all evil                   In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
Proverbs|5|15|Drink waters out of thine own cistern,                   And running waters out of thine own well.
Proverbs|5|16|Should thy springs be dispersed abroad,                   And streams of water in the streets?
Proverbs|5|17|Let them be for thyself alone,                   And not for strangers with thee.
Proverbs|5|18|Let thy fountain be blessed;                   And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
Proverbs|5|19|{As} a loving hind and a pleasant doe,                   Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;                   And be thou ravished always with her love.
Proverbs|5|20|For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,                   And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Proverbs|5|21|For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;                   And he maketh level all his paths.
Proverbs|5|22|His own iniquities shall take the wicked,                   And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
Proverbs|5|23|He shall die for lack of instruction;                   And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Proverbs|6|1|My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor,                   If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;
Proverbs|6|2|Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,                   Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Proverbs|6|3|Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,                   Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor:                   Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;
Proverbs|6|4|Give not sleep to thine eyes,                   Nor slumber to thine eyelids;
Proverbs|6|5|Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand {of the hunter},                   And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

Proverbs|6|8|Provideth her bread in the summer,                   And gathereth her food in the harvest.
Proverbs|6|9|How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?                   When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Proverbs|6|10|{Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber,                   A little folding of the hands to sleep:

Proverbs|6|12|A worthless person, a man of iniquity,                   Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;

Proverbs|6|23|For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light;                   And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Proverbs|6|24|To keep thee from the evil woman,                   From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.
Proverbs|6|25|Lust not after her beauty in thy heart;                   Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

Proverbs|7|7|And I beheld among the simple ones,                   I discerned among the youths,                   A young man void of understanding,
Proverbs|7|8|Passing through the street near her corner;                   And he went the way to her house,
Proverbs|7|9|In the twilight, in the evening of the day,                   In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
Proverbs|7|10|And, behold, there met him a woman                   With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
Proverbs|7|11|She is clamorous and wilful;                   Her feet abide not in her house:
Proverbs|7|12|Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places,                   And lieth in wait at every corner.
Proverbs|7|13|So she caught him, and kissed him,                           {And} with an impudent face she said unto him:
Proverbs|7|14|Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me;                   This day have I paid my vows.
Proverbs|7|15|Therefore came I forth to meet thee,                   Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Proverbs|7|16|I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,                   With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
Proverbs|7|17|I have perfumed my bed                   With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs|7|18|Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;                   Let us solace ourselves with loves.
Proverbs|7|19|For the man is not at home;                   He is gone a long journey:
Proverbs|7|20|He hath taken a bag of money with him;                   He will come home at the full moon.
Proverbs|7|21|With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield;                   With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.
Proverbs|7|22|He goeth after her straightway,                   As an ox goeth to the slaughter,                   Or as {one in} fetters to the correction of the fool;
Proverbs|7|23|Till an arrow strike through his liver;                   As a bird hasteth to the snare,                   And knoweth not that it is for his life.

Proverbs|8|1|Doth not wisdom cry,                   And understanding put forth her voice?
Proverbs|8|2|On the top of high places by the way,                   Where the paths meet, she standeth;
Proverbs|8|3|Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,                   At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:

Judges|2|2|and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this?
Judges|2|3|Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be {as thorns} in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
Judges|2|4|And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
Judges|2|5|And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.
Judges|2|6|Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
Judges|2|7|And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.
Judges|2|8|And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
Judges|2|9|And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Judges|2|10|And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knew not Jehovah, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.
Judges|2|11|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;
Judges|2|12|and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.
Judges|2|13|And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges|2|14|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
Judges|2|15|Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed.
Judges|2|16|And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.
Judges|2|17|And yet they hearkened not unto their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; {but} they did not so.
Judges|2|18|And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
Judges|2|19|But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
Judges|2|20|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
Judges|2|21|I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
Judges|2|22|that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
Judges|2|23|So Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
Judges|3|1|Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, even as many {of Israel} as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
Judges|3|2|only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof:
Judges|3|3|{namely}, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.
Judges|3|4|And they were {left}, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.
Judges|3|5|And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
Judges|3|6|and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.
Judges|3|7|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.
Judges|3|8|Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges|3|9|And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
Judges|3|10|And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.
Judges|3|11|And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
Judges|3|12|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
Judges|3|13|And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.
Judges|3|14|And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
Judges|3|15|But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.
Judges|3|16|And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
Judges|3|17|And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges|3|18|And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.
Judges|3|19|But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
Judges|3|20|And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
Judges|3|21|And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
Judges|3|22|and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
Judges|3|23|Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.
Judges|3|24|Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
Judges|3|25|And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened {them}, and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
Judges|3|26|And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.
Judges|3|27|And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
Judges|3|28|And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.
Judges|3|29|And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.
Judges|3|30|So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
Judges|3|31|And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad: and he also saved Israel.
Judges|4|1|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.
Judges|4|2|And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
Judges|4|3|And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
Judges|4|4|Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
Judges|4|5|And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges|4|6|And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded, {saying}, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
Judges|4|7|And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
Judges|4|8|And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
Judges|4|9|And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges|4|10|And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
Judges|4|11|Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
Judges|4|12|And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
Judges|4|13|And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.
Judges|4|14|And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
Judges|4|15|And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
Judges|4|16|But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
Judges|4|17|Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges|4|18|And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
Judges|4|19|And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
Judges|4|20|And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
Judges|4|21|Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
Judges|4|22|And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.
Judges|4|23|So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
Judges|4|24|And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
Judges|5|1|Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
Judges|5|2|For that the leaders took the lead in Israel,                   For that the people offered themselves willingly,                   Bless ye Jehovah.
Judges|5|3|Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;                   I, {even} I, will sing unto Jehovah;                   I will sing praise to Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Judges|5|4|Jehovah, when thou wentest forth out of Seir,                   When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,                   The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,                   Yea, the clouds dropped water.
Judges|5|5|The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah,                   Even yon Sinai at the presence of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Judges|5|6|In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,                   In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,                   And the travellers walked through byways.
Judges|5|7|The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,                   Until that I Deborah arose,                   That I arose a mother in Israel.
Judges|5|8|They chose new gods;                   Then was war in the gates:                   Was there a shield or spear seen                   Among forty thousand in Israel?
Judges|5|9|My heart is toward the governors of Israel,                   That offered themselves willingly among the people:                   Bless ye Jehovah.
Judges|5|10|Tell {of it}, ye that ride on white asses,                   Ye that sit on rich carpets,                   And ye that walk by the way.
Judges|5|11|Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,                   There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah,                           {Even} the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.                   Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.
Judges|5|12|Awake, awake, Deborah;                   Awake, awake, utter a song:                   Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam.
Judges|5|13|Then came down a remnant of the nobles {and} the people;                   Jehovah came down for me against the mighty.
Judges|5|14|Out of Ephraim {came down} they whose root is in Amalek;                   After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;                   Out of Machir came down governors,                   And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.
Judges|5|15|And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;                   As was Issachar, so was Barak;                   Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.                   By the watercourses of Reuben                   There were great resolves of heart.
Judges|5|16|Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds,                   To hear the pipings for the flocks?                   At the watercourses of Reuben                   There were great searchings of heart.
Judges|5|17|Gilead abode beyond the Jordan:                   And Dan, why did he remain in ships?                   Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,                   And abode by his creeks.
Judges|5|18|Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,                   And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.
Judges|5|19|The kings came and fought;                   Then fought the kings of Canaan.                   In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo:                   They took no gain of money.
Judges|5|20|From heaven fought the stars,                   From their courses they fought against Sisera.
Judges|5|21|The river Kishon swept them away,                   That ancient river, the river Kishon.                   O my soul, march on with strength.
Judges|5|22|Then did the horsehoofs stamp                   By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.
Judges|5|23|Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of Jehovah.                   Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,                   Because they came not to the help of Jehovah,                   To the help of Jehovah against the mighty.
Judges|5|24|Blessed above women shall Jael be,                   The wife of Heber the Kenite;                   Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
Judges|5|25|He asked water, {and} she gave him milk;                   She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
Judges|5|26|She put her hand to the tent-pin,                   And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer;                   And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head;                   Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
Judges|5|27|At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;                   At her feet he bowed, he fell;                   Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
Judges|5|28|Through the window she looked forth, and cried,                   The mother of Sisera {cried} through the lattice,                   Why is his chariot so long in coming?                   Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
Judges|5|29|Her wise ladies answered her,                   Yea, she returned answer to herself,
Judges|5|30|Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?                   A damsel, two damsels to every man;                   To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,                   A spoil of dyed garments embroidered,                   Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
Judges|5|31|So let all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah:                   But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.            And the land had rest forty years.
Judges|6|1|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
Judges|6|2|And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
Judges|6|3|And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;
Judges|6|4|and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
Judges|6|5|For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
Judges|6|6|And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah.
Judges|6|7|And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah because of Midian,
Judges|6|8|that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
Judges|6|9|and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
Judges|6|10|and I said unto you, I am Jehovah your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice.
Judges|6|11|And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
Judges|6|12|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him, and said unto him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
Judges|6|13|And Gideon said unto him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
Judges|6|14|And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?
Judges|6|15|And he said unto him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
Judges|6|16|And Jehovah said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
Judges|6|17|And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.
Judges|6|18|Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
Judges|6|19|And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
Judges|6|20|And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
Judges|6|21|Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
Judges|6|22|And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face.
Judges|6|23|And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
Judges|6|24|Then Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges|6|25|And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Take thy father’s bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
Judges|6|26|and build an altar unto Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.
Judges|6|27|Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Jehovah had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
Judges|6|28|And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
Judges|6|29|And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
Judges|6|30|Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.
Judges|6|31|And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death whilst {it is yet} morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.
Judges|6|32|Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.
Judges|6|33|Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
Judges|6|34|But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
Judges|6|35|And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
Judges|6|36|And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,
Judges|6|37|behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.
Judges|6|38|And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
Judges|6|39|And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
Judges|6|40|And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
Judges|7|1|Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
Judges|7|2|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
Judges|7|3|Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
Judges|7|4|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
Judges|7|5|So he brought down the people unto the water: and Jehovah said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
Judges|7|6|And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
Judges|7|7|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.
Judges|7|8|So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man unto his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
Judges|7|9|And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
Judges|7|10|But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp:
Judges|7|11|and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.
Judges|7|12|And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.
Judges|7|13|And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
Judges|7|14|And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.
Judges|7|15|And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
Judges|7|16|And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
Judges|7|17|And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
Judges|7|18|When I blow the trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.
Judges|7|19|So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
Judges|7|20|And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.
Judges|7|21|And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put {them} to flight.
Judges|7|22|And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every man’s sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
Judges|7|23|And the men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
Judges|7|24|And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.
Judges|7|25|And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
Judges|8|1|And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply.
Judges|8|2|And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
Judges|8|3|God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
Judges|8|4|And Gideon came to the Jordan, {and} passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
Judges|8|5|And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
Judges|8|6|And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
Judges|8|7|And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
Judges|8|8|And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges|8|9|And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
Judges|8|10|Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
Judges|8|11|And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
Judges|8|12|And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
Judges|8|13|And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
Judges|8|14|And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
Judges|8|15|And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
Judges|8|16|And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
Judges|8|17|And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
Judges|8|18|Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
Judges|8|19|And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
Judges|8|20|And he said unto Jether his first-born, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
Judges|8|21|Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
Judges|8|22|Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.
Judges|8|23|And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.
Judges|8|24|And Gideon said unto them, I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
Judges|8|25|And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.
Judges|8|26|And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred {shekels} of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
Judges|8|27|And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
Judges|8|28|So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
Judges|8|29|And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges|8|30|And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.
Judges|8|31|And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
Judges|8|32|And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Judges|8|33|And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
Judges|8|34|And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
Judges|8|35|neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, {who is} Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel.
Judges|9|1|And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
Judges|9|2|Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
Judges|9|3|And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
Judges|9|4|And they gave him threescore and ten {pieces} of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.
Judges|9|5|And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
Judges|9|6|And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
Judges|9|7|And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
Judges|9|8|The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
Judges|9|9|But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|10|And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|11|But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|12|And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|13|And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|14|Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|15|And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
Judges|9|16|Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
Judges|9|17|(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
Judges|9|18|and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
Judges|9|19|if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
Judges|9|20|but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
Judges|9|21|And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
Judges|9|22|And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
Judges|9|23|And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
Judges|9|24|that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
Judges|9|25|And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
Judges|9|26|And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
Judges|9|27|And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod {the grapes}, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
Judges|9|28|And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?
Judges|9|29|And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
Judges|9|30|And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
Judges|9|31|And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city {to take part} against thee.
Judges|9|32|Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
Judges|9|33|and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
Judges|9|34|And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges|9|35|And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.
Judges|9|36|And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
Judges|9|37|And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
Judges|9|38|Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
Judges|9|39|And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
Judges|9|40|And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate.
Judges|9|41|And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
Judges|9|42|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
Judges|9|43|And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; And he rose up against them, and smote them.
Judges|9|44|And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
Judges|9|45|And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
Judges|9|46|And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
Judges|9|47|And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges|9|48|And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
Judges|9|49|And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
Judges|9|50|Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
Judges|9|51|But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower.
Judges|9|52|And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges|9|53|And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and brake his skull.
Judges|9|54|Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
Judges|9|55|And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
Judges|9|56|Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;
Judges|9|57|and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
Judges|10|1|And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.
Judges|10|2|And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
Judges|10|3|And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.
Judges|10|4|And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
Judges|10|5|And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
Judges|10|6|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.
Judges|10|7|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
Judges|10|8|And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years {oppressed they} all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
Judges|10|9|And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
Judges|10|10|And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.
Judges|10|11|And Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, {Did} not {I save you} from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
Judges|10|12|The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand.
Judges|10|13|Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.
Judges|10|14|Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
Judges|10|15|And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
Judges|10|16|And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
Judges|10|17|Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
Judges|10|18|And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges|11|1|Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
Judges|11|2|And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.
Judges|11|3|Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
Judges|11|4|And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
Judges|11|5|And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
Judges|11|6|and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|7|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
Judges|11|8|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges|11|9|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
Judges|11|10|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
Judges|11|11|Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
Judges|11|12|And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?
Judges|11|13|And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those {lands} again peaceably.
Judges|11|14|And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon;
Judges|11|15|and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
Judges|11|16|but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
Judges|11|17|then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
Judges|11|18|Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
Judges|11|19|And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
Judges|11|20|But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
Judges|11|21|And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
Judges|11|22|And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
Judges|11|23|So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?
Judges|11|24|Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
Judges|11|25|And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
Judges|11|26|While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?
Judges|11|27|I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|28|Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
Judges|11|29|Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|30|And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
Judges|11|31|then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
Judges|11|32|So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.
Judges|11|33|And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
Judges|11|34|And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
Judges|11|35|And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
Judges|11|36|And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|37|And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
Judges|11|38|And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
Judges|11|39|And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,
Judges|11|40|that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
Judges|12|1|And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
Judges|12|2|And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
Judges|12|3|And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
Judges|12|4|Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, {and} in the midst of Manasseh.
Judges|12|5|And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when {any of} the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
Judges|12|6|then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
Judges|12|7|And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in {one of} the cities of Gilead.
Judges|12|8|And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
Judges|12|9|And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges|12|10|And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
Judges|12|11|And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges|12|12|And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges|12|13|And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
Judges|12|14|And he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges|12|15|And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.
Judges|13|1|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
Judges|13|2|And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
Judges|13|3|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
Judges|13|4|Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
Judges|13|5|for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
Judges|13|6|Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
Judges|13|7|but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.
Judges|13|8|Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
Judges|13|9|And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges|13|10|And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the {other} day.
Judges|13|11|And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
Judges|13|12|And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and {how} shall we do unto him?
Judges|13|13|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
Judges|13|14|She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
Judges|13|15|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
Judges|13|16|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|17|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?
Judges|13|18|And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
Judges|13|19|So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and {the angel} did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges|13|20|For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges|13|21|But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|22|And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
Judges|13|23|But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
Judges|13|24|And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.
Judges|13|25|And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges|14|1|And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges|14|2|And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
Judges|14|3|Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
Judges|14|4|But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
Judges|14|5|Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
Judges|14|6|And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges|14|7|And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
Judges|14|8|And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
Judges|14|9|And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
Judges|14|10|And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges|14|11|And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges|14|12|And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;
Judges|14|13|but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
Judges|14|14|And he said unto them,             Out of the eater came forth food,                   And out of the strong came forth sweetness.            And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
Judges|14|15|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not {so}?
Judges|14|16|And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?
Judges|14|17|And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
Judges|14|18|And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them,             If ye had not plowed with my heifer,                   Ye had not found out my riddle.
Judges|14|19|And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes {of raiment} unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.
Judges|14|20|But Samson’s wife was {given} to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
Judges|15|1|But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
Judges|15|2|And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
Judges|15|3|And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
Judges|15|4|And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
Judges|15|5|And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.
Judges|15|6|Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
Judges|15|7|And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
Judges|15|8|And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges|15|9|Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
Judges|15|10|And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
Judges|15|11|Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
Judges|15|12|And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
Judges|15|13|And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
Judges|15|14|When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
Judges|15|15|And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.
Judges|15|16|And Samson said,             With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,                   With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.
Judges|15|17|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
Judges|15|18|And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.
Judges|15|19|But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.
Judges|15|20|And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges|16|1|And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her.
Judges|16|2|{And it was told} the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, {Let be} till morning light, then we will kill him.
Judges|16|3|And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
Judges|16|4|And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
Judges|16|5|And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred {pieces} of silver.
Judges|16|6|And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
Judges|16|7|And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|8|Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
Judges|16|9|Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
Judges|16|10|And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
Judges|16|11|And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|12|So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.
Judges|16|13|And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
Judges|16|14|And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
Judges|16|15|And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
Judges|16|16|And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death.
Judges|16|17|And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
Judges|16|18|And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.
Judges|16|19|And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
Judges|16|20|And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
Judges|16|21|And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
Judges|16|22|Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
Judges|16|23|And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
Judges|16|24|And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.
Judges|16|25|And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:
Judges|16|26|and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.
Judges|16|27|Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
Judges|16|28|And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
Judges|16|29|And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
Judges|16|30|And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life.
Judges|16|31|Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
Judges|17|1|And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges|17|2|And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred {pieces} of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah.
Judges|17|3|And he restored the eleven hundred {pieces} of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
Judges|17|4|And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred {pieces} of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|5|And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
Judges|17|6|In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Judges|17|7|And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
Judges|17|8|And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find {a place}, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
Judges|17|9|And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find {a place}.
Judges|17|10|And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten {pieces} of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
Judges|17|11|And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges|17|12|And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|13|Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
Judges|18|1|In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day {their} inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges|18|2|And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.
Judges|18|3|When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
Judges|18|4|And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.
Judges|18|5|And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
Judges|18|6|And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go.
Judges|18|7|Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put {them} to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
Judges|18|8|And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What {say} ye?
Judges|18|9|And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
Judges|18|10|When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
Judges|18|11|And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|12|And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.
Judges|18|13|And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
Judges|18|14|Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
Judges|18|15|And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
Judges|18|16|And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
Judges|18|17|And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|18|And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?
Judges|18|19|And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
Judges|18|20|And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
Judges|18|21|So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
Judges|18|22|When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
Judges|18|23|And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
Judges|18|24|And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?
Judges|18|25|And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
Judges|18|26|And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
Judges|18|27|And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
Judges|18|28|And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.
Judges|18|29|And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
Judges|18|30|And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges|18|31|So they set them up Micah’s graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
Judges|19|1|And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
Judges|19|2|And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.
Judges|19|3|And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
Judges|19|4|And his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
Judges|19|5|And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.
Judges|19|6|So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel’s father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
Judges|19|7|And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
Judges|19|8|And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel’s father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.
Judges|19|9|And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
Judges|19|10|But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.
Judges|19|11|When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
Judges|19|12|And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.
Judges|19|13|And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
Judges|19|14|So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
Judges|19|15|And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
Judges|19|16|And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
Judges|19|17|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
Judges|19|18|And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am {now} going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.
Judges|19|19|Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything.
Judges|19|20|And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
Judges|19|21|So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
Judges|19|22|As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
Judges|19|23|And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
Judges|19|24|Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly.
Judges|19|25|But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
Judges|19|26|Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.
Judges|19|27|And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
Judges|19|28|And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.
Judges|19|29|And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
Judges|19|30|And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.
Judges|20|1|Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.
Judges|20|2|And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
Judges|20|3|(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
Judges|20|4|And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
Judges|20|5|And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.
Judges|20|6|And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
Judges|20|7|Behold, ye children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.
Judges|20|8|And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house.
Judges|20|9|But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: {we will go up} against it by lot;
Judges|20|10|and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
Judges|20|11|So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
Judges|20|12|And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?
Judges|20|13|Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
Judges|20|14|And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
Judges|20|15|And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
Judges|20|16|Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
Judges|20|17|And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
Judges|20|18|And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah {shall go up} first.
Judges|20|19|And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
Judges|20|20|And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
Judges|20|21|And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.
Judges|20|22|And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
Judges|20|23|And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even; and they asked of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.
Judges|20|24|And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
Judges|20|25|And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
Judges|20|26|Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
Judges|20|27|And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
Judges|20|28|and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand.
Judges|20|29|And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.
Judges|20|30|And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
Judges|20|31|And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
Judges|20|32|And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.
Judges|20|33|And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
Judges|20|34|And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them.
Judges|20|35|And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.
Judges|20|36|So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.
Judges|20|37|And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
Judges|20|38|Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
Judges|20|39|And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
Judges|20|40|But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and, behold, the whole of the city went up {in smoke} to heaven.
Judges|20|41|And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.
Judges|20|42|Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof.
Judges|20|43|They inclosed the Benjamites round about, {and} chased them, {and} trod them down at {their} resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
Judges|20|44|And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these {were} men of valor.
Judges|20|45|And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.
Judges|20|46|So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these {were} men of valor.
Judges|20|47|But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
Judges|20|48|And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.
Judges|21|1|Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
Judges|21|2|And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
Judges|21|3|And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?
Judges|21|4|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
Judges|21|5|And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
Judges|21|6|And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
Judges|21|7|How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
Judges|21|8|And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
Judges|21|9|For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
Judges|21|10|And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
Judges|21|11|And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
Judges|21|12|And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
Judges|21|13|And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.
Judges|21|14|And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
Judges|21|15|And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Judges|21|16|Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
Judges|21|17|And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
Judges|21|18|Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
Judges|21|19|And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
Judges|21|20|And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
Judges|21|21|and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges|21|22|And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man {of them} his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now be guilty.
Judges|21|23|And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
Judges|21|24|And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
Judges|21|25|In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Revelation|1|1|The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, {even} the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified {it} by his angel unto his servant John;
Revelation|1|2|who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, {even} of all things that he saw.
Revelation|1|3|Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is at hand.
Revelation|1|4|John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne;
Revelation|1|5|and from Jesus Christ, {who is} the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;
Revelation|1|6|and he made us {to be} a kingdom, {to be} priests unto his God and Father; to him {be} the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Revelation|1|7|Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.
Revelation|1|8|I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
Revelation|1|9|I John, your brother and partaker with you in tribulation and kingdom and patience {which are} in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation|1|10|I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet
Revelation|1|11|saying, What thou seest, write in a book and send {it} to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
Revelation|1|12|And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;
Revelation|1|13|and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation|1|14|And his head and his hair were white as white wool, {white} as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
Revelation|1|15|and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.
Revelation|1|16|And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
Revelation|1|17|And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,
Revelation|1|18|and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Revelation|1|19|Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;
Revelation|1|20|the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.
Revelation|2|1|To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:
Revelation|2|2|I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false;
Revelation|2|3|and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name’s sake, and hast not grown weary.
Revelation|2|4|But I have {this} against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love.
Revelation|2|5|Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.
Revelation|2|6|But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Revelation|2|7|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.
Revelation|2|8|And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived {again}:
Revelation|2|9|I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they art not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation|2|10|Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
Revelation|2|11|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
Revelation|2|12|and to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:
Revelation|2|13|I know where thou dwellest, {even} where Satan’s throne is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth.
Revelation|2|14|But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
Revelation|2|15|So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.
Revelation|2|16|Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
Revelation|2|17|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
Revelation|2|18|And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass:
Revelation|2|19|I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.
Revelation|2|20|But I have {this} against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
Revelation|2|21|And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication.
Revelation|2|22|Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.
Revelation|2|23|And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.
Revelation|2|24|But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden.
Revelation|2|25|Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
Revelation|2|26|And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:
Revelation|2|27|and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:
Revelation|2|28|and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation|2|29|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|1|And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead.
Revelation|3|2|Be thou watchful, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine perfected before my God.
Revelation|3|3|Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear; and keep {it}, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
Revelation|3|4|But thou hast a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.
Revelation|3|5|He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
Revelation|3|6|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|7|And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth:
Revelation|3|8|I know thy works (behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name.
Revelation|3|9|Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
Revelation|3|10|Because thou didst keep the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that {hour} which is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Revelation|3|11|I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.
Revelation|3|12|He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and mine own new name.
Revelation|3|13|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|14|And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
Revelation|3|15|I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
Revelation|3|16|So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
Revelation|3|17|Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked:
Revelation|3|18|I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white garments, that thou mayest clothe thyself, and {that} the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see.
Revelation|3|19|As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
Revelation|3|20|Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
Revelation|3|21|He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.
Revelation|3|22|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|4|1|After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, {a voice} as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.
Revelation|4|2|Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;
Revelation|4|3|and he that sat {was} to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and {there was} a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.
Revelation|4|4|And round about the throne {were} four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones {I saw} four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.
Revelation|4|5|And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And {there was} seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
Revelation|4|6|and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
Revelation|4|7|And the first creature {was} like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature {was} like a flying eagle.
Revelation|4|8|and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying,      Holy, holy, holy, {is} the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.
Revelation|4|9|And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,
Revelation|4|10|the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Revelation|4|11|Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.
Revelation|5|1|And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.
Revelation|5|2|And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
Revelation|5|3|And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
Revelation|5|4|And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:
Revelation|5|5|and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
Revelation|5|6|And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
Revelation|5|7|And he came, and he taketh {it} out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
Revelation|5|8|And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation|5|9|And they sing a new song, saying,      Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood {men} of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
Revelation|5|10|and madest them {to be} unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth.
Revelation|5|11|And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
Revelation|5|12|saying with a great voice,      Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing.
Revelation|5|13|And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things are in them, heard I saying,      Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, {be} the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.
Revelation|5|14|And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
Revelation|6|1|And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come.
Revelation|6|2|And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.
Revelation|6|3|And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.
Revelation|6|4|And another {horse} came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
Revelation|6|5|And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand.
Revelation|6|6|And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not.
Revelation|6|7|And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.
Revelation|6|8|And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation|6|9|And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
Revelation|6|10|and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
Revelation|6|11|And there was given them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled {their course}.
Revelation|6|12|And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;
Revelation|6|13|and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.
Revelation|6|14|And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
Revelation|6|15|And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;
Revelation|6|16|and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
Revelation|6|17|for the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand?
Revelation|7|1|After his I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.
Revelation|7|2|And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
Revelation|7|3|saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
Revelation|7|4|And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:
Revelation|7|5|Of the tribe of Judah {were} sealed twelve thousand:                   Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|6|Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|7|Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|8|Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand;                   Of the tribe of Benjamin {were} sealed twelve thousand.
Revelation|7|9|After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of {all} tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;
Revelation|7|10|and they cry with a great voice, saying,      Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.
Revelation|7|11|And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and {about} the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
Revelation|7|12|saying,      Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, {be} unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
Revelation|7|13|And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they?
Revelation|7|14|And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation|7|15|Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.
Revelation|7|16|They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:
Revelation|7|17|for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.
Revelation|8|1|And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
Revelation|8|2|And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.
Revelation|8|3|And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
Revelation|8|4|And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.
Revelation|8|5|And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
Revelation|8|6|And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
Revelation|8|7|And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
Revelation|8|8|And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
Revelation|8|9|and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, {even} they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
Revelation|8|10|And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters;
Revelation|8|11|and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
Revelation|8|12|And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.
Revelation|8|13|And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.
Revelation|9|1|And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.
Revelation|9|2|And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
Revelation|9|3|And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
Revelation|9|4|And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation|9|5|And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.
Revelation|9|6|And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.
Revelation|9|7|And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men’s faces.
Revelation|9|8|And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as {teeth} of lions.
Revelation|9|9|And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.
Revelation|9|10|And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.
Revelation|9|11|They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek {tongue} he hath the name Apollyon.
Revelation|9|12|The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.
Revelation|9|13|And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Revelation|9|14|one saying to the sixth angel that had one trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.
Revelation|9|15|And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.
Revelation|9|16|And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.
Revelation|9|17|And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates {as} of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation|9|18|By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.
Revelation|9|19|For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.
Revelation|9|20|And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:
Revelation|9|21|and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
Revelation|10|1|And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;
Revelation|10|2|and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth;
Revelation|10|3|and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
Revelation|10|4|And when the seven thunders uttered {their voices}, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
Revelation|10|5|And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,
Revelation|10|6|and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be delay no longer:
Revelation|10|7|but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.
Revelation|10|8|And the voice which I heard from heaven, {I heard it} again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
Revelation|10|9|And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.
Revelation|10|10|And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.
Revelation|10|11|And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
Revelation|11|1|And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
Revelation|11|2|And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.
Revelation|11|3|And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
Revelation|11|4|These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation|11|5|And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.
Revelation|11|6|These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.
Revelation|11|7|And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.
Revelation|11|8|And their dead bodies {lie} in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation|11|9|And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do {men} look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
Revelation|11|10|And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.
Revelation|11|11|And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.
Revelation|11|12|And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
Revelation|11|13|And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation|11|14|The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.
Revelation|11|15|And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said,      The kingdom of the world is become {the kingdom} of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.
Revelation|11|16|And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,
Revelation|11|17|saying,      We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.
Revelation|11|18|And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and {the time} to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.
Revelation|11|19|And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.
Revelation|12|1|And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
Revelation|12|2|and she was the child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered.
Revelation|12|3|And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
Revelation|12|4|And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child.
Revelation|12|5|And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.
Revelation|12|6|And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
Revelation|12|7|And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels {going forth} to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;
Revelation|12|8|And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.
Revelation|12|9|And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
Revelation|12|10|And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying,      Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.
Revelation|12|11|And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.
Revelation|12|12|Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.
Revelation|12|13|And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man {child}.
Revelation|12|14|And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
Revelation|12|15|And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.
Revelation|12|16|And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
Revelation|12|17|And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:
Revelation|13|1|and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
Revelation|13|2|And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as {the feet} of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
Revelation|13|3|And {I saw} one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;
Revelation|13|4|and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him?
Revelation|13|5|and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.
Revelation|13|6|And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, {even} them that dwell in the heaven.
Revelation|13|7|And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
Revelation|13|8|And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, {every one} whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.
Revelation|13|9|If any man hath an ear, let him hear.
Revelation|13|10|If any man {is} for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
Revelation|13|11|And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
Revelation|13|12|And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.
Revelation|13|13|And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.
Revelation|13|14|And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.
Revelation|13|15|And it was given {unto him} to give breath to it, {even} to the image to the breast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
Revelation|13|16|And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;
Revelation|13|17|and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, {even} the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation|13|18|Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.
Revelation|14|1|And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
Revelation|14|2|And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard {was} as {the voice} of harpers harping with their harps:
Revelation|14|3|and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, {even} they that had been purchased out of the earth.
Revelation|14|4|These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These {are} they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, {to be} the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.
Revelation|14|5|And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.
Revelation|14|6|And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
Revelation|14|7|and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
Revelation|14|8|And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
Revelation|14|9|And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,
Revelation|14|10|he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
Revelation|14|11|and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.
Revelation|14|12|Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
Revelation|14|13|And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
Revelation|14|14|And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud {I saw} one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|15|And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
Revelation|14|16|And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
Revelation|14|17|Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|18|And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
Revelation|14|19|And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great {winepress}, of the wrath of God.
Revelation|14|20|And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
Revelation|15|1|And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, {which are} the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.
Revelation|15|2|And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.
Revelation|15|3|And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,      Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.
Revelation|15|4|Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.
Revelation|15|5|And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
Revelation|15|6|and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with {precious} stone, pure {and} bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.
Revelation|15|7|And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
Revelation|15|8|And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
Revelation|16|1|And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.
Revelation|16|2|And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.
Revelation|16|3|And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, {even} the things that were in the sea.
Revelation|16|4|And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.
Revelation|16|5|And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:
Revelation|16|6|for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.
Revelation|16|7|And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
Revelation|16|8|And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.
Revelation|16|9|And men were scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.
Revelation|16|10|And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
Revelation|16|11|and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.
Revelation|16|12|And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the {river} Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might by made ready for the kings that {come} from the sunrising.
Revelation|16|13|And I saw {coming} out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:
Revelation|16|14|for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|16|15|(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see his shame.)
Revelation|16|16|And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon.
Revelation|16|17|And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done:
Revelation|16|18|and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
Revelation|16|19|And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
Revelation|16|20|And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
Revelation|16|21|And great hail, {every stone} about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.
Revelation|17|1|And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;
Revelation|17|2|with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.
Revelation|17|3|And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation|17|4|And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,
Revelation|17|5|and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation|17|6|And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.
Revelation|17|7|And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
Revelation|17|8|The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, {they} whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.
Revelation|17|9|Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:
Revelation|17|10|and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.
Revelation|17|11|And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.
Revelation|17|12|And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
Revelation|17|13|These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.
Revelation|17|14|These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they {also shall overcome} that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.
Revelation|17|15|And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
Revelation|17|16|And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.
Revelation|17|17|For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.
Revelation|17|18|And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
Revelation|18|1|After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
Revelation|18|2|And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.
Revelation|18|3|For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness.
Revelation|18|4|And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:
Revelation|18|5|for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
Revelation|18|6|Render unto her even as she rendered, and double {unto her} the double according to her works: in the cup which she mingled, mingle unto her double.
Revelation|18|7|How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.
Revelation|18|8|Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.
Revelation|18|9|And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,
Revelation|18|10|standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
Revelation|18|11|And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more;
Revelation|18|12|merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
Revelation|18|13|and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and {merchandise} of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men.
Revelation|18|14|And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee, and {men} shall find them no more at all.
Revelation|18|15|The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
Revelation|18|16|saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl!
Revelation|18|17|for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off,
Revelation|18|18|and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What {city} is like the great city?
Revelation|18|19|And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
Revelation|18|20|Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.
Revelation|18|21|And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all.
Revelation|18|22|And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;
Revelation|18|23|and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.
Revelation|18|24|And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.
Revelation|19|1|After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,      Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God:
Revelation|19|2|for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
Revelation|19|3|And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.
Revelation|19|4|And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
Revelation|19|5|And a voice came forth from the throne, saying,      Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great.
Revelation|19|6|And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,      Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.
Revelation|19|7|Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
Revelation|19|8|And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright {and} pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
Revelation|19|9|And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God.
Revelation|19|10|And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
Revelation|19|11|And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
Revelation|19|12|And his eyes {are} a flame of fire, and upon his head {are} many diadems; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself.
Revelation|19|13|And he {is} arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
Revelation|19|14|And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white {and} pure.
Revelation|19|15|And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|19|16|And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation|19|17|And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven, Come {and} be gathered together unto the great supper of God;
Revelation|19|18|that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great.
Revelation|19|19|And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army.
Revelation|19|20|And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone:
Revelation|19|21|and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, {even the sword} which came forth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
Revelation|20|1|And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation|20|2|And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
Revelation|20|3|and cast him into the abyss, and shut {it}, and sealed {it} over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.
Revelation|20|4|And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and {I saw} the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Revelation|20|5|The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation|20|6|Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
Revelation|20|7|And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
Revelation|20|8|and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
Revelation|20|9|And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.
Revelation|20|10|And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Revelation|20|11|And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
Revelation|20|12|And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
Revelation|20|13|And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
Revelation|20|14|And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, {even} the lake of fire.
Revelation|20|15|And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
Revelation|21|1|And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.
Revelation|21|2|And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation|21|3|And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, {and be} their God:
Revelation|21|4|and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away.
Revelation|21|5|And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.
Revelation|21|6|And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
Revelation|21|7|He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
Revelation|21|8|But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part {shall be} in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
Revelation|21|9|And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|10|And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation|21|11|having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:
Revelation|21|12|having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are {the names} of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
Revelation|21|13|on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
Revelation|21|14|And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|15|And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
Revelation|21|16|And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.
Revelation|21|17|And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, {according to} the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
Revelation|21|18|And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.
Revelation|21|19|The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
Revelation|21|20|the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
Revelation|21|21|And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
Revelation|21|22|And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.
Revelation|21|23|And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof {is} the Lamb.
Revelation|21|24|And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
Revelation|21|25|And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):
Revelation|21|26|and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:
Revelation|21|27|and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
Revelation|22|1|And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,
Revelation|22|2|in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve {manner of} fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
Revelation|22|3|And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him;
Revelation|22|4|and they shall see his face; and his name {shall be} on their foreheads.
Revelation|22|5|And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
Revelation|22|6|And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
Revelation|22|7|And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
Revelation|22|8|And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
Revelation|22|9|And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.
Revelation|22|10|And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
Revelation|22|11|He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still.
Revelation|22|12|Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is.
Revelation|22|13|I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
Revelation|22|14|Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right {to come} to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.
Revelation|22|15|Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.
Revelation|22|16|I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.
Revelation|22|17|And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.
Revelation|22|18|I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:
Revelation|22|19|and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
Revelation|22|20|He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation|22|21|The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
Jude|1|1|Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude|1|2|Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.
Jude|1|3|Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.
Jude|1|4|For there are certain men crept in privily, {even} they who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude|1|5|Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
Jude|1|6|And angels that kept not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jude|1|7|Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
Jude|1|8|Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at dignities.
Jude|1|9|But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
Jude|1|10|But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in these things are they destroyed.
Jude|1|11|Woe unto them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
Jude|1|12|These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
Jude|1|13|Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved forever.
Jude|1|14|And to these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
Jude|1|15|to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Jude|1|16|These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling {words}), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.
Jude|1|17|But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Jude|1|18|That they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.
Jude|1|19|These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit.
Jude|1|20|But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude|1|21|keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude|1|22|And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;
Jude|1|23|and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jude|1|24|Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy,
Jude|1|25|to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, {be} glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen.
Haggai|1|1|In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
Haggai|1|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time {for us} to come, the time for Jehovah’s house to be built.
Haggai|1|3|Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|1|4|Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth waste?
Haggai|1|5|Now therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|6|Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages {to put it} into a bag with holes.
Haggai|1|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|8|Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|9|Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.
Haggai|1|10|Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.
Haggai|1|11|And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
Haggai|1|12|Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people did fear before Jehovah.
Haggai|1|13|Then spake Haggai Jehovah’s messenger in Jehovah’s message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|14|And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,
Haggai|1|15|in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth {month}, in the second year of Darius the king.
Haggai|2|1|In the seventh {month}, in the one and twentieth {day} of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|2|Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
Haggai|2|3|Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?
Haggai|2|4|Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts,
Haggai|2|5|{according to} the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you: fear ye not.
Haggai|2|6|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
Haggai|2|7|and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|8|The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|9|The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|10|In the four and twentieth {day} of the ninth {month}, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|11|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
Haggai|2|12|If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
Haggai|2|13|Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
Haggai|2|14|Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
Haggai|2|15|And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.
Haggai|2|16|Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty {measures}, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty {vessels}, there were but twenty.
Haggai|2|17|I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye {turned} not to me, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|2|18|Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth {month}, since the day that the foundation of Jehovah’s temple was laid, consider it.
Haggai|2|19|Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day will I bless {you}.
Haggai|2|20|And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth {day} of the month, saying,
Haggai|2|21|Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
Haggai|2|22|and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
Haggai|2|23|In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Obadiah|1|1|The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, {saying}, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
Obadiah|1|2|Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised.
Obadiah|1|3|The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
Obadiah|1|4|Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.
Obadiah|1|5|If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night (how art thou cut off!), would they not steal {only} till they had enough? if grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
Obadiah|1|6|How are {the things of} Esau searched! how are his hidden treasures sought out!
Obadiah|1|7|All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; {they that eat} thy bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding in him.
Obadiah|1|8|Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
Obadiah|1|9|And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
Obadiah|1|10|For the violence done to thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
Obadiah|1|11|In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
Obadiah|1|12|But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|13|Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay ye {hands} on their substance in the day of their calamity.
Obadiah|1|14|And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|15|For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
Obadiah|1|16|For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
Obadiah|1|17|But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
Obadiah|1|18|And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Obadiah|1|19|And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and they of the lowland the Philistines; and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin {shall possess} Gilead.
Obadiah|1|20|And the captives of this host of the children of Israel, that are {among} the Canaanites, {shall possess} even unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, that are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.
Obadiah|1|21|And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Jehovah’s.
Amos|1|1|The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
Amos|1|2|And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
Amos|1|3|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
Amos|1|4|but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Amos|1|5|And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.
Amos|1|6|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:
Amos|1|7|but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
Amos|1|8|And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|1|9|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:
Amos|1|10|but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
Amos|1|11|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:
Amos|1|12|but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
Amos|1|13|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.
Amos|1|14|But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
Amos|1|15|and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith Jehovah.
Amos|2|1|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
Amos|2|2|but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;
Amos|2|3|and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.
Amos|2|4|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk:
Amos|2|5|but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
Amos|2|6|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes-
Amos|2|7|they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the {same} maiden, to profane my holy name:
Amos|2|8|and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.
Amos|2|9|Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
Amos|2|10|Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
Amos|2|11|And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah.
Amos|2|12|But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
Amos|2|13|Behold, I will press {you} in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.
Amos|2|14|And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
Amos|2|15|neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver {himself}; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;
Amos|2|16|and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith Jehovah.
Amos|3|1|Hear this word that Jehovah hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Amos|3|2|You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.
Amos|3|3|Shall two walk together, except they have agreed?
Amos|3|4|Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
Amos|3|5|Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is {set} for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?
Amos|3|6|Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?
Amos|3|7|Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets.
Amos|3|8|The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who can but prophesy?
Amos|3|9|Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst thereof.
Amos|3|10|For they know not to do right, saith Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
Amos|3|11|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An adversary {there shall be}, even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.
Amos|3|12|Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.
Amos|3|13|Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.
Amos|3|14|For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
Amos|3|15|And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|1|Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords, Bring, and let us drink.
Amos|4|2|The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.
Amos|4|3|And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall cast {yourselves} into Harmon, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|4|Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, {and} multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, {and} your tithes every three days;
Amos|4|5|and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|4|6|And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|7|And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
Amos|4|8|So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|9|I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|10|I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|11|I have overthrown {cities} among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|12|Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; {and} because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
Amos|4|13|For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought; that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the Earth-jehovah, the God of hosts, is his name.
Amos|5|1|Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.
Amos|5|2|The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
Amos|5|3|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.
Amos|5|4|For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;
Amos|5|5|but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.
Amos|5|6|Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.
Amos|5|7|Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,
Amos|5|8|{seek him} that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);
Amos|5|9|that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.
Amos|5|10|They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
Amos|5|11|Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.
Amos|5|12|For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate {from their right}.
Amos|5|13|Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.
Amos|5|14|Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.
Amos|5|15|Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
Amos|5|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.
Amos|5|17|And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
Amos|5|18|Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.
Amos|5|19|As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
Amos|5|20|Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
Amos|5|21|I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
Amos|5|22|Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
Amos|5|23|Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
Amos|5|24|But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
Amos|5|25|Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
Amos|5|26|Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
Amos|5|27|Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.
Amos|6|1|Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!
Amos|6|2|Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?
Amos|6|3|-ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
Amos|6|4|that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
Amos|6|5|that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; that invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;
Amos|6|6|that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
Amos|6|7|Therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.
Amos|6|8|The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
Amos|6|9|And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
Amos|6|10|And when a man’s uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Jehovah.
Amos|6|11|For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and the great house shall be smitten with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
Amos|6|12|Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow {there} with oxen? that ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;
Amos|6|13|ye that rejoice in a thing of nought, that say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
Amos|6|14|For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of the Arabah.
Amos|7|1|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
Amos|7|2|And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
Amos|7|3|Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.
Amos|7|4|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.
Amos|7|5|Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
Amos|7|6|Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|7|7|Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
Amos|7|8|And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;
Amos|7|9|and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Amos|7|10|Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos|7|11|For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos|7|12|Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
Amos|7|13|but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.
Amos|7|14|Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:
Amos|7|15|and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
Amos|7|16|Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not {thy word} against the house of Isaac;
Amos|7|17|therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos|8|1|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
Amos|8|2|And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
Amos|8|3|And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.
Amos|8|4|Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,
Amos|8|5|saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
Amos|8|6|that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
Amos|8|7|Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Amos|8|8|Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
Amos|8|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
Amos|8|10|And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
Amos|8|11|Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.
Amos|8|12|And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it.
Amos|8|13|In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.
Amos|8|14|They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; they shall fall, and never rise up again.
Amos|9|1|I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.
Amos|9|2|Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
Amos|9|3|And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
Amos|9|4|And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
Amos|9|5|For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, {is} he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;
Amos|9|6|{it is} he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.
Amos|9|7|Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
Amos|9|8|Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.
Amos|9|9|For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as {grain} is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.
Amos|9|10|All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.
Amos|9|11|In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
Amos|9|12|that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this.
Amos|9|13|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
Amos|9|14|And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
Amos|9|15|And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God.
Joshua|1|1|Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,
Joshua|1|2|Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
Joshua|1|3|Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.
Joshua|1|4|From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
Joshua|1|5|There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Joshua|1|6|Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
Joshua|1|7|Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua|1|8|This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
Joshua|1|9|Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua|1|10|Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua|1|11|Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.
Joshua|1|12|And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
Joshua|1|13|Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.
Joshua|1|14|Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;
Joshua|1|15|until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as {he hath given} you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|1|16|And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.
Joshua|1|17|According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
Joshua|1|18|Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.
Joshua|2|1|And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.
Joshua|2|2|And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.
Joshua|2|3|And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.
Joshua|2|4|And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:
Joshua|2|5|and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
Joshua|2|6|But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
Joshua|2|7|And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
Joshua|2|8|And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
Joshua|2|9|and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
Joshua|2|10|For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
Joshua|2|11|And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
Joshua|2|12|Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token;
Joshua|2|13|and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
Joshua|2|14|And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
Joshua|2|15|Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
Joshua|2|16|And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
Joshua|2|17|And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|18|Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.
Joshua|2|19|And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
Joshua|2|20|But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|21|And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
Joshua|2|22|And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
Joshua|2|23|Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.
Joshua|2|24|And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.
Joshua|3|1|And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.
Joshua|3|2|And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua|3|3|and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
Joshua|3|4|Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
Joshua|3|5|And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.
Joshua|3|6|And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
Joshua|3|7|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
Joshua|3|8|And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
Joshua|3|9|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
Joshua|3|10|And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua|3|11|Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.
Joshua|3|12|Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
Joshua|3|13|And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.
Joshua|3|14|And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;
Joshua|3|15|and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
Joshua|3|16|that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
Joshua|3|17|And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.
Joshua|4|1|And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|4|2|Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Joshua|4|3|and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.
Joshua|4|4|Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
Joshua|4|5|and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua|4|6|that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
Joshua|4|7|then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
Joshua|4|8|And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
Joshua|4|9|And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
Joshua|4|10|For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
Joshua|4|11|And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
Joshua|4|12|And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
Joshua|4|13|about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
Joshua|4|14|On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
Joshua|4|15|And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|4|16|Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua|4|17|Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
Joshua|4|18|And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime.
Joshua|4|19|And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
Joshua|4|20|And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
Joshua|4|21|And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
Joshua|4|22|Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
Joshua|4|23|For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;
Joshua|4|24|that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye may fear Jehovah your God for ever.
Joshua|5|1|And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
Joshua|5|2|At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
Joshua|5|3|And Joshua made him knives of lint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
Joshua|5|4|And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.
Joshua|5|5|For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
Joshua|5|6|For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Joshua|5|7|And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
Joshua|5|8|And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
Joshua|5|9|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.
Joshua|5|10|And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
Joshua|5|11|And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.
Joshua|5|12|And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
Joshua|5|13|And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
Joshua|5|14|And he said, Nay; but {as} prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
Joshua|5|15|And the prince of Jehovah’s host said unto Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.
Joshua|6|1|Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
Joshua|6|2|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.
Joshua|6|3|And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
Joshua|6|4|And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
Joshua|6|5|And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.
Joshua|6|6|And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|7|And they said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|8|And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.
Joshua|6|9|And the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets, and the rearward went after the ark, {the priests} blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua|6|10|And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
Joshua|6|11|So he caused the ark of Jehovah to compass the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
Joshua|6|12|And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|13|And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah went on continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; and the rearward came after the ark of Jehovah, {the priests} blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua|6|14|And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.
Joshua|6|15|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.
Joshua|6|16|And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.
Joshua|6|17|And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
Joshua|6|18|But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
Joshua|6|19|But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|20|So the people shouted, and {the priests} blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
Joshua|6|21|And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
Joshua|6|22|And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
Joshua|6|23|And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.
Joshua|6|24|And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|25|But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua|6|26|And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
Joshua|6|27|So Jehovah was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
Joshua|7|1|But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the children of Israel.
Joshua|7|2|And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
Joshua|7|3|And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.
Joshua|7|4|So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua|7|5|And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men; and they chased them {from} before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
Joshua|7|6|And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
Joshua|7|7|And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!
Joshua|7|8|Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!
Joshua|7|9|For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do for thy great name?
Joshua|7|10|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?
Joshua|7|11|Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.
Joshua|7|12|Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua|7|13|Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua|7|14|In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.
Joshua|7|15|And it shall be, that he that is taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath; because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
Joshua|7|16|So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
Joshua|7|17|and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
Joshua|7|18|and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
Joshua|7|19|And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
Joshua|7|20|And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
Joshua|7|21|when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
Joshua|7|22|So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
Joshua|7|23|And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.
Joshua|7|24|And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.
Joshua|7|25|And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
Joshua|7|26|And they raised over him a great heap of stones, unto this day; and Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.
Joshua|8|1|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;
Joshua|8|2|And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: set thee an ambush for the city behind it.
Joshua|8|3|So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.
Joshua|8|4|And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
Joshua|8|5|and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;
Joshua|8|6|and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;
Joshua|8|7|and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua|8|8|And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.
Joshua|8|9|And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
Joshua|8|10|And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
Joshua|8|11|And all the people, {even} the {men of} war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua|8|12|And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
Joshua|8|13|So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
Joshua|8|14|And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua|8|15|And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua|8|16|And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua|8|17|And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
Joshua|8|18|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
Joshua|8|19|And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.
Joshua|8|20|And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
Joshua|8|21|And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|22|And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
Joshua|8|23|And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua|8|24|And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua|8|25|And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|26|For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua|8|27|Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
Joshua|8|28|So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.
Joshua|8|29|And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.
Joshua|8|30|Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
Joshua|8|31|as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
Joshua|8|32|And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua|8|33|And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
Joshua|8|34|And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
Joshua|8|35|There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.
Joshua|9|1|And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
Joshua|9|2|that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
Joshua|9|3|But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
Joshua|9|4|they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,
Joshua|9|5|and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.
Joshua|9|6|And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|7|And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?
Joshua|9|8|And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
Joshua|9|9|And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
Joshua|9|10|and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Joshua|9|11|And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|12|This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:
Joshua|9|13|and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
Joshua|9|14|And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.
Joshua|9|15|And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
Joshua|9|16|And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
Joshua|9|17|And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua|9|18|And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
Joshua|9|19|But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
Joshua|9|20|This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
Joshua|9|21|And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.
Joshua|9|22|And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
Joshua|9|23|Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
Joshua|9|24|And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
Joshua|9|25|And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
Joshua|9|26|And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
Joshua|9|27|And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.
Joshua|10|1|Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
Joshua|10|2|that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
Joshua|10|3|Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Joshua|10|4|Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
Joshua|10|5|Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
Joshua|10|6|And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.
Joshua|10|7|So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
Joshua|10|8|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
Joshua|10|9|Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; {for} he went up from Gilgal all the night.
Joshua|10|10|And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
Joshua|10|11|And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
Joshua|10|12|Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel,             Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;                   And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
Joshua|10|13|And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,                   Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.            Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
Joshua|10|14|And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.
Joshua|10|15|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua|10|16|And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|17|And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|18|And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:
Joshua|10|19|but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.
Joshua|10|20|And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
Joshua|10|21|that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
Joshua|10|22|Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.
Joshua|10|23|And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
Joshua|10|24|And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
Joshua|10|25|And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
Joshua|10|26|And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
Joshua|10|27|And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.
Joshua|10|28|And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua|10|29|And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
Joshua|10|30|and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua|10|31|And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|32|and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
Joshua|10|33|Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
Joshua|10|34|And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
Joshua|10|35|and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
Joshua|10|36|And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
Joshua|10|37|and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
Joshua|10|38|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|39|and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.
Joshua|10|40|So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.
Joshua|10|41|And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
Joshua|10|42|And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
Joshua|10|43|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua|11|1|And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua|11|2|and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
Joshua|11|3|to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua|11|4|And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
Joshua|11|5|And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
Joshua|11|6|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
