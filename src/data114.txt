Revelation|12|3|And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
Revelation|12|4|And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child.
Revelation|12|5|And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.
Revelation|12|6|And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
Revelation|12|7|And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels {going forth} to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;
Revelation|12|8|And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.
Revelation|12|9|And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
Revelation|12|10|And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying,      Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.
Revelation|12|11|And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.
Revelation|12|12|Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.
Revelation|12|13|And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man {child}.
Revelation|12|14|And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
Revelation|12|15|And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.
Revelation|12|16|And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
Revelation|12|17|And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:
Revelation|13|1|and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
Revelation|13|2|And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as {the feet} of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
Revelation|13|3|And {I saw} one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;
Revelation|13|4|and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him?
Revelation|13|5|and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.
Revelation|13|6|And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, {even} them that dwell in the heaven.
Revelation|13|7|And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
Revelation|13|8|And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, {every one} whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.
Revelation|13|9|If any man hath an ear, let him hear.
Revelation|13|10|If any man {is} for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
Revelation|13|11|And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
Revelation|13|12|And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.
Revelation|13|13|And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.
Revelation|13|14|And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.
Revelation|13|15|And it was given {unto him} to give breath to it, {even} to the image to the breast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
Revelation|13|16|And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;
Revelation|13|17|and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, {even} the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation|13|18|Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.
Revelation|14|1|And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
Revelation|14|2|And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard {was} as {the voice} of harpers harping with their harps:
Revelation|14|3|and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, {even} they that had been purchased out of the earth.
Revelation|14|4|These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These {are} they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, {to be} the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.
Revelation|14|5|And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.
Revelation|14|6|And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
Revelation|14|7|and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
Revelation|14|8|And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
Revelation|14|9|And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,
Revelation|14|10|he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
Revelation|14|11|and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.
Revelation|14|12|Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
Revelation|14|13|And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
Revelation|14|14|And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud {I saw} one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|15|And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
Revelation|14|16|And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
Revelation|14|17|Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|18|And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
Revelation|14|19|And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great {winepress}, of the wrath of God.
Revelation|14|20|And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
Revelation|15|1|And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, {which are} the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.
Revelation|15|2|And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.
Revelation|15|3|And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,      Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.
Revelation|15|4|Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.
Revelation|15|5|And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
Revelation|15|6|and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with {precious} stone, pure {and} bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.
Revelation|15|7|And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
Revelation|15|8|And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
Revelation|16|1|And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.
Revelation|16|2|And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.
Revelation|16|3|And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, {even} the things that were in the sea.
Revelation|16|4|And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.
Revelation|16|5|And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:
Revelation|16|6|for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.
Revelation|16|7|And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
Revelation|16|8|And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.
Revelation|16|9|And men were scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.
Revelation|16|10|And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
Revelation|16|11|and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.
Revelation|16|12|And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the {river} Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might by made ready for the kings that {come} from the sunrising.
Revelation|16|13|And I saw {coming} out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:
Revelation|16|14|for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|16|15|(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see his shame.)
Revelation|16|16|And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon.
Revelation|16|17|And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done:
Revelation|16|18|and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
Revelation|16|19|And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
Revelation|16|20|And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
Revelation|16|21|And great hail, {every stone} about the weight of a talent, cometh down out of heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof is exceeding great.
Revelation|17|1|And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;
Revelation|17|2|with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.
Revelation|17|3|And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation|17|4|And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,
Revelation|17|5|and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation|17|6|And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.
Revelation|17|7|And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
Revelation|17|8|The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, {they} whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.
Revelation|17|9|Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:
Revelation|17|10|and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.
Revelation|17|11|And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.
Revelation|17|12|And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
Revelation|17|13|These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.
Revelation|17|14|These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they {also shall overcome} that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.
Revelation|17|15|And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
Revelation|17|16|And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.
Revelation|17|17|For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.
Revelation|17|18|And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.
