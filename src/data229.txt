1 Corinthians|12|25|that there should be no schism in the body; but {that} the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians|12|26|And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or {one} member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
1 Corinthians|12|27|Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.
1 Corinthians|12|28|And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, {divers} kinds of tongues.
1 Corinthians|12|29|Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all {workers of} miracles?
1 Corinthians|12|30|have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians|12|31|But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.
1 Corinthians|13|1|If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians|13|2|And if I have {the gift of} prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|3|And if I bestow all my goods to feed {the poor}, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|4|Love suffereth long, {and} is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1 Corinthians|13|5|doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;
1 Corinthians|13|6|rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;
1 Corinthians|13|7|beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1 Corinthians|13|8|Love never faileth: but whether {there be} prophecies, they shall be done away; whether {there be} tongues, they shall cease; whether {there be} knowledge, it shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|9|For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
1 Corinthians|13|10|but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|11|When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.
1 Corinthians|13|12|For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.
1 Corinthians|13|13|But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
1 Corinthians|14|1|Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual {gifts}, but rather that ye may prophesy.
1 Corinthians|14|2|For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1 Corinthians|14|3|But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
1 Corinthians|14|4|He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians|14|5|Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|6|But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
1 Corinthians|14|7|Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1 Corinthians|14|8|For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
1 Corinthians|14|9|So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.
1 Corinthians|14|10|There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no {kind} is without signification.
1 Corinthians|14|11|If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.
1 Corinthians|14|12|So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual {gifts}, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.
1 Corinthians|14|13|Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians|14|14|For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians|14|15|What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1 Corinthians|14|16|Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?
1 Corinthians|14|17|For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1 Corinthians|14|18|I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:
1 Corinthians|14|19|howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians|14|20|Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.
1 Corinthians|14|21|In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|22|Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying {is for a sign}, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
1 Corinthians|14|23|If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?
1 Corinthians|14|24|But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;
1 Corinthians|14|25|the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
1 Corinthians|14|26|What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|27|If any man speaketh in a tongue, {let it be} by two, or at the most three, and {that} in turn; and let one interpret:
1 Corinthians|14|28|but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
1 Corinthians|14|29|And let the prophets speak {by} two or three, and let the others discern.
1 Corinthians|14|30|But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.
1 Corinthians|14|31|For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;
1 Corinthians|14|32|and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
1 Corinthians|14|33|for God is not {a God} of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
1 Corinthians|14|34|let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.
1 Corinthians|14|35|And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.
1 Corinthians|14|36|What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?
1 Corinthians|14|37|If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|38|But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1 Corinthians|14|39|Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
1 Corinthians|14|40|But let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians|15|1|Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,
1 Corinthians|15|2|by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.
1 Corinthians|15|3|For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|4|and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|5|and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;
1 Corinthians|15|6|then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;
1 Corinthians|15|7|then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;
1 Corinthians|15|8|and last of all, as to the {child} untimely born, he appeared to me also.
1 Corinthians|15|9|For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
1 Corinthians|15|10|But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1 Corinthians|15|11|Whether then {it be} I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1 Corinthians|15|12|Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians|15|13|But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|14|and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.
1 Corinthians|15|15|Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.
1 Corinthians|15|16|For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|17|and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
1 Corinthians|15|18|Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians|15|19|If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
1 Corinthians|15|20|But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.
1 Corinthians|15|21|For since by man {came} death, by man {came} also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians|15|22|For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians|15|23|But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.
1 Corinthians|15|24|Then {cometh} the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
1 Corinthians|15|25|For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians|15|26|The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians|15|27|For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.
1 Corinthians|15|28|And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians|15|29|Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
1 Corinthians|15|30|Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians|15|31|I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
1 Corinthians|15|32|If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
1 Corinthians|15|33|Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
1 Corinthians|15|34|Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak {this} to move you to shame.
1 Corinthians|15|35|But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?
1 Corinthians|15|36|Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:
1 Corinthians|15|37|and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;
1 Corinthians|15|38|but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
1 Corinthians|15|39|All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one {flesh} of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
1 Corinthians|15|40|There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the {glory} of the terrestrial is another.
