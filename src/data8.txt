Exodus|7|4|But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
Exodus|7|5|And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
Exodus|7|6|And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they.
Exodus|7|7|And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
Exodus|7|8|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Exodus|7|9|When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
Exodus|7|10|And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
Exodus|7|11|Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
Exodus|7|12|For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
Exodus|7|13|And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
Exodus|7|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go.
Exodus|7|15|Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
Exodus|7|16|And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.
Exodus|7|17|Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
Exodus|7|18|And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
Exodus|7|19|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.
Exodus|7|20|And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
Exodus|7|21|And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|7|22|And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
Exodus|7|23|And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.
Exodus|7|24|And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
Exodus|7|25|And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river.
Exodus|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|8|2|And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
Exodus|8|3|and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:
Exodus|8|4|and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
Exodus|8|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|6|And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|7|And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|8|Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.
Exodus|8|9|And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?
Exodus|8|10|And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God.
Exodus|8|11|And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
Exodus|8|12|And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.
Exodus|8|13|And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
Exodus|8|14|And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.
Exodus|8|15|But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken.
Exodus|8|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|17|And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|18|And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
Exodus|8|19|Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
Exodus|8|20|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|8|21|Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
Exodus|8|22|And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
Exodus|8|23|And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be.
Exodus|8|24|And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
Exodus|8|25|And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
Exodus|8|26|And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
Exodus|8|27|We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.
Exodus|8|28|And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
Exodus|8|29|And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
Exodus|8|30|And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
Exodus|8|31|And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
Exodus|8|32|And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus|9|1|Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|9|2|For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
Exodus|9|3|behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: {there shall be} a very grievous murrain.
Exodus|9|4|And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.
Exodus|9|5|And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.
Exodus|9|6|And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
Exodus|9|7|And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus|9|8|And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
Exodus|9|9|And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|10|And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
Exodus|9|11|And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
Exodus|9|12|And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.
Exodus|9|13|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|9|14|For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Exodus|9|15|For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:
Exodus|9|16|but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
Exodus|9|17|As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
Exodus|9|18|Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
Exodus|9|19|Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; {for} every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
Exodus|9|20|He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
Exodus|9|21|And he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.
Exodus|9|22|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|23|And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|24|So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus|9|25|And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
Exodus|9|26|Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
Exodus|9|27|And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
Exodus|9|28|Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of {these} mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
Exodus|9|29|And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah’s.
Exodus|9|30|But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.
Exodus|9|31|And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
Exodus|9|32|But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
Exodus|9|33|And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
Exodus|9|34|And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
Exodus|9|35|And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.
Exodus|10|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,
Exodus|10|2|and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
Exodus|10|3|And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|10|4|Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:
Exodus|10|5|and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
Exodus|10|6|and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
Exodus|10|7|And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
Exodus|10|8|And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?
Exodus|10|9|And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.
Exodus|10|10|And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
Exodus|10|11|Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
Exodus|10|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
Exodus|10|13|And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
Exodus|10|14|And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
Exodus|10|15|For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|10|16|Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
Exodus|10|17|Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
Exodus|10|18|And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
Exodus|10|19|And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.
Exodus|10|20|But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
Exodus|10|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
Exodus|10|22|And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;
Exodus|10|23|they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
Exodus|10|24|And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
Exodus|10|25|And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.
Exodus|10|26|Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.
Exodus|10|27|But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
Exodus|10|28|And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
Exodus|10|29|And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.
Exodus|11|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
Exodus|11|2|Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
Exodus|11|3|And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
Exodus|11|4|And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
Exodus|11|5|and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.
Exodus|11|6|And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.
Exodus|11|7|But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
Exodus|11|8|And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
Exodus|11|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|11|10|And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus|12|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
Exodus|12|2|This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus|12|3|Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth {day} of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household:
Exodus|12|4|and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.
Exodus|12|5|Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
Exodus|12|6|and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.
Exodus|12|7|And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.
Exodus|12|8|And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Exodus|12|9|Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.
Exodus|12|10|And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
Exodus|12|11|And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah’s passover.
Exodus|12|12|For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah.
Exodus|12|13|And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
Exodus|12|14|And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
Exodus|12|15|Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus|12|16|And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
Exodus|12|17|And ye shall observe the {feast of} unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever.
Exodus|12|18|In the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
Exodus|12|19|Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.
Exodus|12|20|Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
Exodus|12|21|Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.
Exodus|12|22|And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
Exodus|12|23|For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
Exodus|12|24|And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
Exodus|12|25|And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
Exodus|12|26|And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
Exodus|12|27|that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
Exodus|12|28|And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
Exodus|12|29|And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
Exodus|12|30|And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
Exodus|12|31|And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.
Exodus|12|32|Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
Exodus|12|33|And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.
Exodus|12|34|And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
Exodus|12|35|And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
Exodus|12|36|And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
Exodus|12|37|And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.
Exodus|12|38|And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
Exodus|12|39|And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
Exodus|12|40|Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus|12|41|And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.
Exodus|12|42|It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
Exodus|12|43|And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;
Exodus|12|44|but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
Exodus|12|45|A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
Exodus|12|46|In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
Exodus|12|47|All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Exodus|12|48|And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
Exodus|12|49|One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
Exodus|12|50|Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
Exodus|12|51|And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
Exodus|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|13|2|Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
Exodus|13|3|And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
Exodus|13|4|This day ye go forth in the month Abib.
Exodus|13|5|And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
Exodus|13|6|Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.
Exodus|13|7|Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.
Exodus|13|8|And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.
Exodus|13|9|And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.
Exodus|13|10|Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
Exodus|13|11|And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
Exodus|13|12|that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah’s.
Exodus|13|13|And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.
Exodus|13|14|And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
Exodus|13|15|and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.
Exodus|13|16|And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.
Exodus|13|17|And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
Exodus|13|18|but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|13|19|And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
Exodus|13|20|And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus|13|21|And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
Exodus|13|22|the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.
Exodus|14|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|14|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.
Exodus|14|3|And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
Exodus|14|4|And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.
Exodus|14|5|And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
Exodus|14|6|And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
Exodus|14|7|and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
Exodus|14|8|And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
Exodus|14|9|And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses {and} chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
Exodus|14|10|And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.
Exodus|14|11|And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
Exodus|14|12|Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
Exodus|14|13|And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
Exodus|14|14|Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
Exodus|14|15|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
Exodus|14|16|And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
Exodus|14|17|And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
Exodus|14|18|And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
Exodus|14|19|And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:
Exodus|14|20|and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.
Exodus|14|21|And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go {back} by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
Exodus|14|22|And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
Exodus|14|23|And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Exodus|14|24|And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.
Exodus|14|25|And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
Exodus|14|26|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
Exodus|14|27|And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
Exodus|14|28|And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.
Exodus|14|29|But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
Exodus|14|30|Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
Exodus|14|31|And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.
Exodus|15|1|Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying,             I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously:                   The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
Exodus|15|2|Jehovah is my strength and song,                   And he is become my salvation:                   This is my God, and I will praise him;                   My father’s God, and I will exalt him.
Exodus|15|3|Jehovah is a man of war:                   Jehovah is his name.
Exodus|15|4|Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea;                   And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
Exodus|15|5|The deeps cover them:                   They went down into the depths like a stone.
Exodus|15|6|Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power,                   Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy.
Exodus|15|7|And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.
Exodus|15|8|And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up,                   The floods stood upright as a heap;                   The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
Exodus|15|9|The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;                   My desire shall be satisfied upon them;                   I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
Exodus|15|10|Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:                   They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus|15|11|Who is like unto thee, O Jehovah, among the gods?                   Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,                   Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
Exodus|15|12|Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,                   The earth swallowed them.
Exodus|15|13|Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed:                   Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
Exodus|15|14|The peoples have heard, they tremble:                   Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus|15|15|Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed;                   The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them:                   All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
Exodus|15|16|Terror and dread falleth upon them;                   By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone;                   Till thy people pass over, O Jehovah,                   Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.
Exodus|15|17|Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,                   The place, O Jehovah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in,                   The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
Exodus|15|18|Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.
Exodus|15|19|For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
Exodus|15|20|And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
Exodus|15|21|And Miriam answered them,             Sing ye to Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously;                   The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
Exodus|15|22|And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
Exodus|15|23|And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
Exodus|15|24|And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
Exodus|15|25|An he cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;
Exodus|15|26|and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah that healeth thee.
Exodus|15|27|And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
Exodus|16|1|And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|16|2|And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:
Exodus|16|3|and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
Exodus|16|4|Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
Exodus|16|5|And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
Exodus|16|6|And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;
Exodus|16|7|and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
Exodus|16|8|And Moses said, {This shall be}, when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.
Exodus|16|9|And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings.
Exodus|16|10|And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
Exodus|16|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|16|12|I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
Exodus|16|13|And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
Exodus|16|14|And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground.
Exodus|16|15|And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.
Exodus|16|16|This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.
Exodus|16|17|And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
Exodus|16|18|And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
Exodus|16|19|And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
Exodus|16|20|Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.
Exodus|16|21|And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
Exodus|16|22|And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
Exodus|16|23|And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
Exodus|16|24|And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.
Exodus|16|25|And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.
Exodus|16|26|Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
Exodus|16|27|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.
Exodus|16|28|And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
Exodus|16|29|See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
Exodus|16|30|So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus|16|31|And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers {made} with honey.
Exodus|16|32|And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
Exodus|16|33|And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.
Exodus|16|34|As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
Exodus|16|35|And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
Exodus|16|36|Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus|17|1|And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus|17|2|Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?
Exodus|17|3|And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
Exodus|17|4|And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
Exodus|17|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
Exodus|17|6|Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|17|7|And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?
Exodus|17|8|Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus|17|9|And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
Exodus|17|10|So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus|17|11|And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus|17|12|But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus|17|13|And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus|17|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
Exodus|17|15|And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;
Exodus|17|16|And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Exodus|18|1|Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus|18|2|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
Exodus|18|3|and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:
Exodus|18|4|and the name of the other was Eliezer; for {he said}, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Exodus|18|5|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:
Exodus|18|6|and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
Exodus|18|7|And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
Exodus|18|8|And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.
Exodus|18|9|And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|10|And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|11|Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
Exodus|18|12|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
Exodus|18|13|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.
Exodus|18|14|And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?
Exodus|18|15|And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
Exodus|18|16|when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
Exodus|18|17|And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
Exodus|18|18|Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
Exodus|18|19|Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:
Exodus|18|20|and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
Exodus|18|21|Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
Exodus|18|22|and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear {the burden} with thee.
Exodus|18|23|If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
Exodus|18|24|So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
Exodus|18|25|And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
Exodus|18|26|And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
Exodus|18|27|And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus|19|1|In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus|19|2|And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
Exodus|19|3|And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
Exodus|19|4|Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.
Exodus|19|5|Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:
Exodus|19|6|and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
Exodus|19|7|And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.
Exodus|19|8|And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|10|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,
Exodus|19|11|and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
Exodus|19|12|And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
Exodus|19|13|no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
Exodus|19|14|And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
Exodus|19|15|And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
Exodus|19|16|And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
Exodus|19|17|And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
Exodus|19|18|And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
Exodus|19|19|And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
Exodus|19|20|And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
Exodus|19|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
Exodus|19|22|And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|23|And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
Exodus|19|24|And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|25|So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
Exodus|20|1|And God spake all these words, saying,
Exodus|20|2|I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Exodus|20|3|Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Exodus|20|4|Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness {of any thing} that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
Exodus|20|5|Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
Exodus|20|6|and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus|20|7|Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Exodus|20|8|Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus|20|9|Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
Exodus|20|10|but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
Exodus|20|11|for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
Exodus|20|12|Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Exodus|20|13|Thou shalt not kill.
Exodus|20|14|Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Exodus|20|15|Thou shalt not steal.
Exodus|20|16|Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Exodus|20|17|Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.
Exodus|20|18|And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
Exodus|20|19|And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
Exodus|20|20|And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
Exodus|20|21|And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus|20|22|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
Exodus|20|23|Ye shall not make {other gods} with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
Exodus|20|24|An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
Exodus|20|25|And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
Exodus|20|26|Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.
Exodus|21|1|Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.
Exodus|21|2|If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
Exodus|21|3|If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus|21|4|If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
Exodus|21|5|But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
Exodus|21|6|then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
Exodus|21|7|And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.
Exodus|21|8|If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
Exodus|21|9|And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
Exodus|21|10|If he take him another {wife}; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
Exodus|21|11|And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
Exodus|21|12|He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|21|13|And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver {him} into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
Exodus|21|14|And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
Exodus|21|15|And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
Exodus|21|16|And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|21|17|And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|21|18|And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;
Exodus|21|19|if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
Exodus|21|20|And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.
Exodus|21|21|Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
Exodus|21|22|And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
Exodus|21|23|But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
Exodus|21|24|eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus|21|25|burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
Exodus|21|26|And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.
Exodus|21|27|And if he smite out his man-servant’s tooth, or his maid-servant’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
Exodus|21|28|And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
Exodus|21|29|But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus|21|30|If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
Exodus|21|31|Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
Exodus|21|32|If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
Exodus|21|33|And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
Exodus|21|34|the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead {beast} shall be his.
Exodus|21|35|And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide.
Exodus|21|36|Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead {beast} shall be his own.
Exodus|22|1|If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
Exodus|22|2|If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
Exodus|22|3|If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
Exodus|22|4|If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.
Exodus|22|5|If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
Exodus|22|6|If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
Exodus|22|7|If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.
Exodus|22|8|If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, {to see} whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods.
Exodus|22|9|For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, {or} for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor.
Exodus|22|10|If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
Exodus|22|11|the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
Exodus|22|12|But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
Exodus|22|13|If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he shall not make good that which was torn.
Exodus|22|14|And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.
Exodus|22|15|If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.
Exodus|22|16|And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
Exodus|22|17|If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
Exodus|22|18|Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
Exodus|22|19|Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|22|20|He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.
Exodus|22|21|And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|22|22|Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
Exodus|22|23|If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
Exodus|22|24|and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
Exodus|22|25|If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.
Exodus|22|26|If thou at all take thy neighbor’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:
Exodus|22|27|for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
Exodus|22|28|Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
Exodus|22|29|Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
Exodus|22|30|Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, {and} with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
Exodus|22|31|And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
Exodus|23|1|Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
Exodus|23|2|Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest {justice}:
Exodus|23|3|neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause.
Exodus|23|4|If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
Exodus|23|5|If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release {it} with him.
Exodus|23|6|Thou shalt not wrest the justice {due} to thy poor in his cause.
Exodus|23|7|Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
Exodus|23|8|And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
Exodus|23|9|And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|23|10|And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:
Exodus|23|11|but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, {and} with thy oliveyard.
Exodus|23|12|Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.
Exodus|23|13|And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
Exodus|23|14|Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
Exodus|23|15|The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:
Exodus|23|16|and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.
Exodus|23|17|Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.
Exodus|23|18|Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
Exodus|23|19|The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
Exodus|23|20|Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
Exodus|23|21|Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him.
Exodus|23|22|But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
Exodus|23|23|For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.
Exodus|23|24|Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.
Exodus|23|25|And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
Exodus|23|26|There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
Exodus|23|27|I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
Exodus|23|28|And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
Exodus|23|29|I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
Exodus|23|30|By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
Exodus|23|31|And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
Exodus|23|32|Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
Exodus|23|33|They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
Exodus|24|1|And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:
Exodus|24|2|and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.
Exodus|24|3|And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.
Exodus|24|4|And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus|24|5|And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah.
Exodus|24|6|And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
Exodus|24|7|And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.
Exodus|24|8|And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words.
Exodus|24|9|Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|24|10|And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
Exodus|24|11|And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.
Exodus|24|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.
Exodus|24|13|And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
Exodus|24|14|And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.
Exodus|24|15|And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.
Exodus|24|16|And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
Exodus|24|17|And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
Exodus|24|18|And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
Exodus|25|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|25|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering.
Exodus|25|3|And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,
Exodus|25|4|and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ {hair},
Exodus|25|5|and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,
Exodus|25|6|oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
Exodus|25|7|onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
Exodus|25|8|And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
Exodus|25|9|According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.
Exodus|25|10|And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
Exodus|25|11|And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.
Exodus|25|12|And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
Exodus|25|13|And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
Exodus|25|14|And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark.
Exodus|25|15|The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.
Exodus|25|16|And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
Exodus|25|17|And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half {shall be} the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
Exodus|25|18|And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat.
Exodus|25|19|And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.
Exodus|25|20|And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.
Exodus|25|21|And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
Exodus|25|22|And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
Exodus|25|23|And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits {shall be} the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
Exodus|25|24|And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.
Exodus|25|25|And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about; and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
Exodus|25|26|And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.
Exodus|25|27|Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table.
Exodus|25|28|And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.
Exodus|25|29|And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out: of pure gold shalt thou make them.
Exodus|25|30|And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me alway.
Exodus|25|31|And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.
Exodus|25|32|And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
Exodus|25|33|three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick:
Exodus|25|34|and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;
Exodus|25|35|and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
Exodus|25|36|Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.
Exodus|25|37|And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven: and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it.
Exodus|25|38|And the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.
Exodus|25|39|Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels.
Exodus|25|40|And see that thou make them after their pattern, which hath been showed thee in the mount.
Exodus|26|1|Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shalt thou make them.
Exodus|26|2|The length of each curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains shall have one measure.
Exodus|26|3|Five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and {the other} five curtains shall be coupled one to another.
Exodus|26|4|And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is outmost in the second coupling.
Exodus|26|5|Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the second coupling; the loops shall be opposite one to another.
Exodus|26|6|And thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps: and the tabernacle shall be one {whole}.
Exodus|26|7|And thou shalt make curtains of goats’ {hair} for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make them.
Exodus|26|8|The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: the eleven curtains shall have one measure.
Exodus|26|9|And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double over the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent.
Exodus|26|10|And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain which is {outmost in} the second coupling.
Exodus|26|11|And thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.
Exodus|26|12|And the overhanging part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
Exodus|26|13|And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.
Exodus|26|14|And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
Exodus|26|15|And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up.
Exodus|26|16|Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.
Exodus|26|17|Two tenons shall there be in each board, joined one to another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus|26|18|And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward.
Exodus|26|19|And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
Exodus|26|20|And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards,
Exodus|26|21|and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

Exodus|32|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Exodus|32|10|now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
Exodus|32|11|And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Exodus|32|12|Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
Exodus|32|13|Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
Exodus|32|14|And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people.
Exodus|32|15|And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
Exodus|32|16|And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
Exodus|32|17|And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
Exodus|32|18|And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
Exodus|32|19|And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
Exodus|32|20|And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
Exodus|32|21|And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?
Exodus|32|22|And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are {set} on evil.
Exodus|32|23|For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Exodus|32|24|And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
Exodus|32|25|And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)
Exodus|32|26|then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovah’s side, {let him come} unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
Exodus|32|27|And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
Exodus|32|28|And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
Exodus|32|29|And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
Exodus|32|30|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.
Exodus|32|31|And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
Exodus|32|32|Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
Exodus|32|33|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
Exodus|32|34|And now go, lead the people unto {the place} of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
Exodus|32|35|And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
Exodus|33|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
Exodus|33|2|and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Exodus|33|3|unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.
Exodus|33|4|And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
Exodus|33|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
Exodus|33|6|And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
Exodus|33|7|Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.
Exodus|33|8|And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.
Exodus|33|9|And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and {Jehovah} spake with Moses.
Exodus|33|10|And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.
Exodus|33|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
Exodus|33|12|And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.
Exodus|33|13|Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
Exodus|33|14|And he said, My presence shall go {with thee}, and I will give thee rest.
Exodus|33|15|And he said unto him, If thy presence go not {with me}, carry us not up hence.
Exodus|33|16|For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?
Exodus|33|17|And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.
Exodus|33|18|And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.
Exodus|33|19|And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
Exodus|33|20|And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live.
Exodus|33|21|and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:
Exodus|33|22|and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:
Exodus|33|23|and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen.
Exodus|34|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.
Exodus|34|2|And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
Exodus|34|3|And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
Exodus|34|4|And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.
Exodus|34|5|And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
Exodus|34|6|And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,
Exodus|34|7|keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear {the guilty}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Exodus|34|8|And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
Exodus|34|9|And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
Exodus|34|10|And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.
Exodus|34|11|Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus|34|12|Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
Exodus|34|13|but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;
Exodus|34|14|for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
Exodus|34|15|lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;
Exodus|34|16|and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.
Exodus|34|17|Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
Exodus|34|18|The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
Exodus|34|19|All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.
Exodus|34|20|And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
Exodus|34|21|Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
Exodus|34|22|And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, {even} of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
Exodus|34|23|Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Exodus|34|24|For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.
Exodus|34|25|Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
Exodus|34|26|The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
Exodus|34|27|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
Exodus|34|28|And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
Exodus|34|29|And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
Exodus|34|30|And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
Exodus|34|31|And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.
Exodus|34|32|And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
Exodus|34|33|And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
Exodus|34|34|But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
Exodus|34|35|And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
Exodus|35|1|And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them.
Exodus|35|2|Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.
Exodus|35|3|Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
Exodus|35|4|And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,
Exodus|35|5|Take ye from among you an offering unto Jehovah; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Jehovah’s offering: gold, and silver, and brass,
Exodus|35|6|and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ {hair},
Exodus|35|7|and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,
Exodus|35|8|and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
Exodus|35|9|and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
Exodus|35|10|And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:
Exodus|35|11|the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
Exodus|35|12|the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen;
Exodus|35|13|the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread;
Exodus|35|14|the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light;
Exodus|35|15|and the altar of incense, and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;
Exodus|35|16|the altar of burnt-offering, with its grating of brass, it staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;
Exodus|35|17|the hangings of the court, the pillars thereof, and their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
Exodus|35|18|the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords;
Exodus|35|19|the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.
Exodus|35|20|And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
Exodus|35|21|And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, {and} brought Jehovah’s offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.
Exodus|35|22|And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, {and} brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah.
Exodus|35|23|And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ {hair}, and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them.
Exodus|35|24|Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah’s offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
Exodus|35|25|And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.
Exodus|35|26|And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ {hair}.
Exodus|35|27|And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
Exodus|35|28|and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
Exodus|35|29|The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto Jehovah; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.
Exodus|35|30|And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
Exodus|35|31|And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
Exodus|35|32|and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
Exodus|35|33|and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.
Exodus|35|34|And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
Exodus|35|35|Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works.
Exodus|36|1|And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath commanded.
Exodus|36|2|And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
Exodus|36|3|and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning.
Exodus|36|4|And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.
Exodus|36|5|And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.
Exodus|36|6|And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
Exodus|36|7|For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
Exodus|36|8|And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, {Bezalel} made them.
Exodus|36|9|The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure.
Exodus|36|10|And he coupled five curtains one to another: and {the other} five curtains he coupled one to another.
Exodus|36|11|And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.
Exodus|36|12|Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another.
Exodus|36|13|And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.
Exodus|36|14|And he made curtains of goats’ {hair} for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
Exodus|36|15|The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure.
Exodus|36|16|And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
Exodus|36|17|And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was {outmost in} the second coupling.
Exodus|36|18|And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
Exodus|36|19|And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
Exodus|36|20|And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up.
Exodus|36|21|Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.
Exodus|36|22|Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus|36|23|And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.
Exodus|36|24|And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
Exodus|36|25|And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,
Exodus|36|26|and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
Exodus|36|27|And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
Exodus|36|28|And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.
Exodus|36|29|And they were double beneath; and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners.
Exodus|36|30|And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
Exodus|36|31|And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
Exodus|36|32|and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.
Exodus|36|33|And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.
Exodus|36|34|And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
Exodus|36|35|And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, made he it.
Exodus|36|36|And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver.
Exodus|36|37|And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer;
Exodus|36|38|and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass.
Exodus|37|1|And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
Exodus|37|2|and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.
Exodus|37|3|And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
Exodus|37|4|And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus|37|5|And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
Exodus|37|6|And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half {was} the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
Exodus|37|7|And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;
Exodus|37|8|one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof.
Exodus|37|9|And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.
Exodus|37|10|And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits {was} the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:
Exodus|37|11|and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.
Exodus|37|12|And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
Exodus|37|13|And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.
Exodus|37|14|Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.
Exodus|37|15|And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.
Exodus|37|16|And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.
Exodus|37|17|And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, it knops, and its flowers, were of one piece with it:
Exodus|37|18|and there were six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
Exodus|37|19|three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
Exodus|37|20|And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;
Exodus|37|21|and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.
Exodus|37|22|Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.
Exodus|37|23|And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold.
Exodus|37|24|Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.
Exodus|37|25|And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood: a cubit was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, foursquare; and two cubits was the height thereof; the horns thereof were of one piece with it.
Exodus|37|26|And he overlaid it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: and he made unto it a crown of gold round about.
Exodus|37|27|And he made for it two golden rings under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it, for places for staves wherewith to bear it.
Exodus|37|28|And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus|37|29|And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of the perfumer.
Exodus|38|1|And he made the altar of burnt-offering of acacia wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof, foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.
Exodus|38|2|And he made the horns thereof upon the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of one piece with it: and he overlaid it with brass.
Exodus|38|3|And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, the flesh-hooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.
Exodus|38|4|And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, under the ledge round it beneath, reaching halfway up.
Exodus|38|5|And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass, to be places for the staves.
Exodus|38|6|And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass.
Exodus|38|7|And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, wherewith to bear it; he made it hollow with planks.
Exodus|38|8|And he made the laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the ministering women that ministered at the door of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|38|9|And he made the court: for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits;
Exodus|38|10|their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
Exodus|38|11|And for the north side a hundred cubits, their pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.
Exodus|38|12|And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.
Exodus|38|13|And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.
Exodus|38|14|The hangings for the one side {of the gate} were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three;
Exodus|38|15|and so for the other side: on this hand and that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
Exodus|38|16|All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.
Exodus|38|17|And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
Exodus|38|18|And the screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
Exodus|38|19|And their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their fillets, of silver.
Exodus|38|20|And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.
Exodus|38|21|This is the sum of {the things for} the tabernacle, even the tabernacle of the testimony, as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
Exodus|38|22|And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|38|23|And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skilful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in fine linen.
Exodus|38|24|All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Exodus|38|25|And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
Exodus|38|26|a beka a head, {that is}, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that passed over to them that were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.
Exodus|38|27|And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
Exodus|38|28|And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five {shekels} he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them.
Exodus|38|29|And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
Exodus|38|30|And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
Exodus|38|31|and the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the gate of the court, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
Exodus|39|1|And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|2|And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
Exodus|39|3|And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman.
Exodus|39|4|They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together.
Exodus|39|5|And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece {and} like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|6|And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.
Exodus|39|7|And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|8|And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
Exodus|39|9|It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double.
Exodus|39|10|And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;
Exodus|39|11|and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
Exodus|39|12|and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
Exodus|39|13|and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings.
Exodus|39|14|And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.
Exodus|39|15|And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.
Exodus|39|16|And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
Exodus|39|17|And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.
Exodus|39|18|And the {other} two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.
Exodus|39|19|And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.
Exodus|39|20|And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.
Exodus|39|21|And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|22|And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
Exodus|39|23|And the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.
Exodus|39|24|And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, {and} twined {linen}.
Exodus|39|25|And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;
Exodus|39|26|a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|27|And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
Exodus|39|28|and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,
Exodus|39|29|and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|30|And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.
Exodus|39|31|And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|32|Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.
Exodus|39|33|And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;
Exodus|39|34|and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;
Exodus|39|35|the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;
Exodus|39|36|the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;
Exodus|39|37|the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;
Exodus|39|38|and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;
Exodus|39|39|the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;
Exodus|39|40|the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
Exodus|39|41|the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.
Exodus|39|42|According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.
Exodus|39|43|And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
Exodus|40|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|40|2|On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|40|3|And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.
Exodus|40|4|And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
Exodus|40|5|And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|6|And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|40|7|And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
Exodus|40|8|And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
Exodus|40|9|And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.
Exodus|40|10|And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.
Exodus|40|11|And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.
Exodus|40|12|And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.
Exodus|40|13|And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
Exodus|40|14|And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;
Exodus|40|15|and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
Exodus|40|16|Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
Exodus|40|17|And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
Exodus|40|18|And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.
Exodus|40|19|And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|20|And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
Exodus|40|21|and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|22|And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
Exodus|40|23|And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|24|And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
Exodus|40|25|And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|26|And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:
Exodus|40|27|and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|28|And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|29|And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|30|And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.
Exodus|40|31|And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;
Exodus|40|32|when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|33|And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
Exodus|40|34|Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|35|And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|36|And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:
Exodus|40|37|but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
Exodus|40|38|For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
2 Peter|1|1|Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and {the} Saviour Jesus Christ:
2 Peter|1|2|Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
2 Peter|1|3|seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;
2 Peter|1|4|whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust.
2 Peter|1|5|Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in {your} virtue knowledge;
2 Peter|1|6|and in {your} knowledge self-control; and in {your} self-control patience; and in {your} patience godliness;
2 Peter|1|7|and in {your} godliness brotherly kindness; and in {your} brotherly kindness love.
2 Peter|1|8|For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|9|For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
2 Peter|1|10|Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:
2 Peter|1|11|for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|12|Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with {you}.
2 Peter|1|13|And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
2 Peter|1|14|knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.
2 Peter|1|15|Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
2 Peter|1|16|For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2 Peter|1|17|For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:
2 Peter|1|18|and this voice we {ourselves} heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
2 Peter|1|19|And we have the word of prophecy {made} more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:
2 Peter|1|20|knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
2 Peter|1|21|For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
2 Peter|2|1|But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter|2|2|And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.
2 Peter|2|3|And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
2 Peter|2|4|For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
2 Peter|2|5|and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2 Peter|2|6|and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;
2 Peter|2|7|and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked
2 Peter|2|8|(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed {his} righteous soul from day to day with {their} lawless deeds):
2 Peter|2|9|the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;
2 Peter|2|10|but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:
2 Peter|2|11|whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter|2|12|But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,
2 Peter|2|13|suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; {men} that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you;
2 Peter|2|14|having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;
2 Peter|2|15|forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the {son} of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;
2 Peter|2|16|but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter|2|17|These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.
2 Peter|2|18|For, uttering great swelling {words} of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;
2 Peter|2|19|promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.
2 Peter|2|20|For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.
2 Peter|2|21|For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
2 Peter|2|22|It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
2 Peter|3|1|This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance;
2 Peter|3|2|that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:
2 Peter|3|3|knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,
2 Peter|3|4|and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
2 Peter|3|5|For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;
2 Peter|3|6|by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
2 Peter|3|7|but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
2 Peter|3|8|But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter|3|9|The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2 Peter|3|10|But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
2 Peter|3|11|Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in {all} holy living and godliness,
2 Peter|3|12|looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
2 Peter|3|13|But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
2 Peter|3|14|Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.
2 Peter|3|15|And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;
2 Peter|3|16|as also in all {his} epistles, speaking in them of these things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as {they do} also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2 Peter|3|17|Ye therefore, beloved, knowing {these things} beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.
2 Peter|3|18|But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him {be} the glory both now and for ever. Amen.
2 Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy|1|2|to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy|1|3|I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day
2 Timothy|1|4|longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
2 Timothy|1|5|having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
2 Timothy|1|6|For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy|1|7|For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
2 Timothy|1|8|Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;
2 Timothy|1|9|who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
2 Timothy|1|10|but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
2 Timothy|1|11|whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
2 Timothy|1|12|For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2 Timothy|1|13|Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|1|14|That good thing which was committed unto {thee} guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy|1|15|This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy|1|16|The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
2 Timothy|1|17|but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
2 Timothy|1|18|(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2 Timothy|2|1|Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|2|2|And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy|2|3|Suffer hardship with {me}, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|2|4|No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of {this} life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
2 Timothy|2|5|And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.
2 Timothy|2|6|The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
2 Timothy|2|7|Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy|2|8|Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
2 Timothy|2|9|wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
2 Timothy|2|10|Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2 Timothy|2|11|Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
2 Timothy|2|12|if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
2 Timothy|2|13|if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy|2|14|Of these things put them in remembrance, charging {them} in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
2 Timothy|2|15|Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
2 Timothy|2|16|But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
2 Timothy|2|17|and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;
2 Timothy|2|18|men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
2 Timothy|2|19|Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
2 Timothy|2|20|Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
2 Timothy|2|21|If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.
2 Timothy|2|22|after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy|2|23|But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
2 Timothy|2|24|And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
2 Timothy|2|25|in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,
2 Timothy|2|26|and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.
2 Timothy|3|1|But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
2 Timothy|3|2|For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2 Timothy|3|3|without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
2 Timothy|3|4|traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
2 Timothy|3|5|holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.
2 Timothy|3|6|For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
2 Timothy|3|7|ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy|3|8|And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
2 Timothy|3|9|But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
2 Timothy|3|10|But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
2 Timothy|3|11|persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy|3|12|Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
2 Timothy|3|13|But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
2 Timothy|3|14|But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
2 Timothy|3|15|And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|3|16|Every scripture inspired of God {is} also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.
2 Timothy|3|17|That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
2 Timothy|4|1|I charge {thee} in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
2 Timothy|4|2|preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
2 Timothy|4|3|For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;
2 Timothy|4|4|and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.
2 Timothy|4|5|But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.
2 Timothy|4|6|For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
2 Timothy|4|7|I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
2 Timothy|4|8|henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
2 Timothy|4|9|Give diligence to come shortly unto me:
2 Timothy|4|10|for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy|4|11|Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
2 Timothy|4|12|But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy|4|13|The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
2 Timothy|4|14|Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:
2 Timothy|4|15|of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
2 Timothy|4|16|At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
2 Timothy|4|17|But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2 Timothy|4|18|The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom {be} the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy|4|19|Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy|4|20|Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
2 Timothy|4|21|Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2 Timothy|4|22|The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Ephesians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|1|3|Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly {places} in Christ:
Ephesians|1|4|even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:
Ephesians|1|5|having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Ephesians|1|6|to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:
Ephesians|1|7|in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
Ephesians|1|8|which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
Ephesians|1|9|making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
Ephesians|1|10|unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, {I say,}
Ephesians|1|11|in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;
Ephesians|1|12|to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
Ephesians|1|13|in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,-- in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians|1|14|which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of {God’s} own possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Ephesians|1|15|For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which {ye show} toward all the saints,
Ephesians|1|16|cease not to give thanks for you, making mention {of you} in my prayers;
Ephesians|1|17|that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
Ephesians|1|18|having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians|1|19|and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
Ephesians|1|20|which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly {places},
Ephesians|1|21|far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
Ephesians|1|22|and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,
Ephesians|1|23|which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
Ephesians|2|1|And you {did he make alive,} when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,
Ephesians|2|2|wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;
Ephesians|2|3|among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--
Ephesians|2|4|but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Ephesians|2|5|even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),
Ephesians|2|6|and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly {places}, in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|7|that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|8|for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God;
Ephesians|2|9|not of works, that no man should glory.
Ephesians|2|10|For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.
Ephesians|2|11|Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;
Ephesians|2|12|that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians|2|13|But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.
Ephesians|2|14|For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,
Ephesians|2|15|having abolished in the flesh the enmity, {even} the law of commandments {contained} in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, {so} making peace;
Ephesians|2|16|and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
Ephesians|2|17|and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:
Ephesians|2|18|for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians|2|19|So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
Ephesians|2|20|being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;
Ephesians|2|21|in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;
Ephesians|2|22|in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians|3|1|For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,--
Ephesians|3|2|if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;
Ephesians|3|3|how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,
Ephesians|3|4|whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
Ephesians|3|5|which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
Ephesians|3|6|{to wit}, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
Ephesians|3|7|whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
Ephesians|3|8|Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
Ephesians|3|9|and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;
Ephesians|3|10|to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly {places} might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
Ephesians|3|11|according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians|3|12|in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
Ephesians|3|13|Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
Ephesians|3|14|For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
Ephesians|3|15|from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians|3|16|that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
Ephesians|3|17|that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians|3|18|may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
Ephesians|3|19|and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
Ephesians|3|20|Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Ephesians|3|21|unto him {be} the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians|4|1|I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
Ephesians|4|2|with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Ephesians|4|3|giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians|4|4|{There is} one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians|4|5|one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians|4|6|one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
Ephesians|4|7|But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians|4|8|Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.
Ephesians|4|9|(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians|4|10|He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
Ephesians|4|11|And he gave some {to be} apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
Ephesians|4|12|for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:
Ephesians|4|13|till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
Ephesians|4|14|that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
Ephesians|4|15|but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, {even} Christ;
Ephesians|4|16|from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in {due} measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.
Ephesians|4|17|This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,
Ephesians|4|18|being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;
Ephesians|4|19|who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
Ephesians|4|20|But ye did not so learn Christ;
Ephesians|4|21|if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
Ephesians|4|22|that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
Ephesians|4|23|and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
Ephesians|4|24|and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
Ephesians|4|25|Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
Ephesians|4|26|Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
Ephesians|4|27|neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians|4|28|Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.
Ephesians|4|29|Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.
Ephesians|4|30|And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.
Ephesians|4|31|Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:
Ephesians|4|32|and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.
Ephesians|5|1|Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
Ephesians|5|2|and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.
Ephesians|5|3|But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;
Ephesians|5|4|nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians|5|5|For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians|5|6|Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians|5|7|Be not ye therefore partakers with them;
Ephesians|5|8|For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light
Ephesians|5|9|(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Ephesians|5|10|proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;
Ephesians|5|11|and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
Ephesians|5|12|for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.
Ephesians|5|13|But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.
Ephesians|5|14|Wherefore {he} saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.
Ephesians|5|15|Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
Ephesians|5|16|redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians|5|17|Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians|5|18|And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;
Ephesians|5|19|speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
Ephesians|5|20|giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
Ephesians|5|21|subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians|5|22|Wives, {be in subjection} unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
Ephesians|5|23|For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, {being} himself the saviour of the body.
Ephesians|5|24|But as the church is subject to Christ, so {let} the wives also {be} to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians|5|25|Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;
Ephesians|5|26|that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
Ephesians|5|27|that he might present the church to himself a glorious {church}, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Ephesians|5|28|Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:
Ephesians|5|29|for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;
Ephesians|5|30|because we are members of his body.
Ephesians|5|31|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.
Ephesians|5|32|This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.
Ephesians|5|33|Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and {let} the wife {see} that she fear her husband.
Ephesians|6|1|Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Ephesians|6|2|Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),
Ephesians|6|3|that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
Ephesians|6|4|And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians|6|5|Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
Ephesians|6|6|not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Ephesians|6|7|with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men:
Ephesians|6|8|knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether {he be} bond or free.
Ephesians|6|9|And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
Ephesians|6|10|Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
Ephesians|6|11|Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Ephesians|6|12|For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual {hosts} of wickedness in the heavenly {places}.
Ephesians|6|13|Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
Ephesians|6|14|Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
Ephesians|6|15|and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians|6|16|withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil {one}.
Ephesians|6|17|And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians|6|18|with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,
Ephesians|6|19|And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians|6|20|for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians|6|21|But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
Ephesians|6|22|whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians|6|23|Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|6|24|Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with {a love} incorruptible.
Galatians|1|1|Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
Galatians|1|2|and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
Galatians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians|1|4|who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
Galatians|1|5|to whom {be} the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians|1|6|I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;
Galatians|1|7|which is not another {gospel} only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians|1|8|But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|9|As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|10|For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.
Galatians|1|11|For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.
Galatians|1|12|For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but {it came to me} through revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians|1|13|For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:
Galatians|1|14|and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians|1|15|But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, {even} from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,
Galatians|1|16|to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Galatians|1|17|neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.
Galatians|1|18|Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.
Galatians|1|19|But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
Galatians|1|20|Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
Galatians|1|21|Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians|1|22|And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
Galatians|1|23|but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;
Galatians|1|24|and they glorified God in me.
Galatians|2|1|Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
Galatians|2|2|And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.
Galatians|2|3|But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
Galatians|2|4|and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Galatians|2|5|to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Galatians|2|6|But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:
Galatians|2|7|but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with {the gospel} of the circumcision
Galatians|2|8|(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);
Galatians|2|9|and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;
Galatians|2|10|only {they would} that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.
Galatians|2|11|But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians|2|12|For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.
Galatians|2|13|And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians|2|14|But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before {them} all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
Galatians|2|15|We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
Galatians|2|16|yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Galatians|2|17|But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.
Galatians|2|18|For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.
Galatians|2|19|For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.
Galatians|2|20|I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me: and that {life} which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, {the faith} which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.
Galatians|2|21|I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.
Galatians|3|1|O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?
Galatians|3|2|This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|3|Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?
Galatians|3|4|Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.
Galatians|3|5|He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, {doeth he it} by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|6|Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Galatians|3|7|Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.
Galatians|3|8|And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, {saying,} In thee shall all the nations be blessed.
Galatians|3|9|So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
Galatians|3|10|For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.
Galatians|3|11|Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;
Galatians|3|12|and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.
Galatians|3|13|Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
Galatians|3|14|that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians|3|15|Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.
Galatians|3|16|Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Galatians|3|17|Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.
Galatians|3|18|For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.
Galatians|3|19|What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; {and it was} ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
Galatians|3|20|Now a mediator is not {a mediator} of one; but God is one.
Galatians|3|21|Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.
Galatians|3|22|But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Galatians|3|23|But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Galatians|3|24|So that the law is become our tutor {to bring us} unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians|3|25|But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Galatians|3|26|For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|27|For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.
Galatians|3|28|There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one {man} in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|29|And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.
Galatians|4|1|But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;
Galatians|4|2|but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.
Galatians|4|3|So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:
Galatians|4|4|but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
Galatians|4|5|that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Galatians|4|6|And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Galatians|4|7|So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
Galatians|4|8|Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:
Galatians|4|9|but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?
Galatians|4|10|Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.
Galatians|4|11|I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.
Galatians|4|12|I beseech you, brethren, become as I {am}, for I also {am become} as ye {are}. Ye did me no wrong:
Galatians|4|13|but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:
Galatians|4|14|and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, {even} as Christ Jesus.
Galatians|4|15|Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
Galatians|4|16|So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?
Galatians|4|17|They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.
Galatians|4|18|But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians|4|19|My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you--
Galatians|4|20|but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.
Galatians|4|21|Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Galatians|4|22|For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.
Galatians|4|23|Howbeit the {son} by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the {son} by the freewoman {is born} through promise.
Galatians|4|24|Which things contain an allegory: for these {women} are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.
Galatians|4|25|Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.
Galatians|4|26|But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.
Galatians|4|27|For it is written,             Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;                   Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:                   For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.
Galatians|4|28|Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
Galatians|4|29|But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him {that was born} after the Spirit, so also it is now.
Galatians|4|30|Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians|4|31|Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.
Galatians|5|1|For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
Galatians|5|2|Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
Galatians|5|3|Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Galatians|5|4|Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
Galatians|5|5|For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
Galatians|5|6|For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
Galatians|5|7|Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?
Galatians|5|8|This persuasion {came} not of him that calleth you.
Galatians|5|9|A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Galatians|5|10|I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
Galatians|5|11|But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.
Galatians|5|12|I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
Galatians|5|13|For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only {use} not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.
Galatians|5|14|For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, {even} in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Galatians|5|15|But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Galatians|5|16|But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Galatians|5|17|For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.
Galatians|5|18|But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Galatians|5|19|Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are {these}: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Galatians|5|20|idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,
Galatians|5|21|envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians|5|22|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians|5|23|meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
Galatians|5|24|And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
Galatians|5|25|If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
Galatians|5|26|Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
Galatians|6|1|Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Galatians|6|2|Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Galatians|6|3|For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Galatians|6|4|But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.
Galatians|6|5|For each man shall bear his own burden.
Galatians|6|6|But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Galatians|6|7|Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Galatians|6|8|For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians|6|9|And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians|6|10|So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.
Galatians|6|11|See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.
Galatians|6|12|As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians|6|13|For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Galatians|6|14|But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Galatians|6|15|For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Galatians|6|16|And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace {be} upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Galatians|6|17|Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.
Galatians|6|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
1 Corinthians|1|1|Paul, called {to be} an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
1 Corinthians|1|2|unto the church of God which is at Corinth, {even} them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called {to be} saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their {Lord} and ours:
1 Corinthians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|4|I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
1 Corinthians|1|5|that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;
1 Corinthians|1|6|even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians|1|7|so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
1 Corinthians|1|8|who shall also confirm you unto the end, {that ye be} unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|9|God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians|1|10|Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and {that} there be no divisions among you; but {that} ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
1 Corinthians|1|11|For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them {that are of the household} of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1 Corinthians|1|12|Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|13|Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians|1|14|I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;
1 Corinthians|1|15|lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.
1 Corinthians|1|16|And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1 Corinthians|1|17|For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.
1 Corinthians|1|18|For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians|1|19|For it is written,             I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,                   And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.
1 Corinthians|1|20|Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1 Corinthians|1|21|For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.
1 Corinthians|1|22|Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:
1 Corinthians|1|23|but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;
1 Corinthians|1|24|but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
1 Corinthians|1|25|Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians|1|26|For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, {are called}:
1 Corinthians|1|27|but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
1 Corinthians|1|28|and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, {yea} and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:
1 Corinthians|1|29|that no flesh should glory before God.
1 Corinthians|1|30|But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
1 Corinthians|1|31|that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|2|1|And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
1 Corinthians|2|2|For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
1 Corinthians|2|3|And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
1 Corinthians|2|4|And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
1 Corinthians|2|5|that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1 Corinthians|2|6|We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:
1 Corinthians|2|7|but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, {even} the {wisdom} that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:
1 Corinthians|2|8|which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:
1 Corinthians|2|9|but as it is written,             Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not,                   And {which} entered not into the heart of man,                   Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.
1 Corinthians|2|10|But unto us God revealed {them} through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
1 Corinthians|2|11|For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians|2|12|But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.
1 Corinthians|2|13|Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual {words}.
1 Corinthians|2|14|Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.
1 Corinthians|2|15|But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.
1 Corinthians|2|16|For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|1|And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|2|I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able {to bear it}: nay, not even now are ye able;
1 Corinthians|3|3|for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?
1 Corinthians|3|4|For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
1 Corinthians|3|5|What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
1 Corinthians|3|6|I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|7|So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|8|Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
1 Corinthians|3|9|For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.
1 Corinthians|3|10|According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
1 Corinthians|3|11|For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|12|But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
1 Corinthians|3|13|each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.
1 Corinthians|3|14|If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
1 Corinthians|3|15|If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
1 Corinthians|3|16|Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and {that} the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1 Corinthians|3|17|If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
1 Corinthians|3|18|Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
1 Corinthians|3|19|For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:
1 Corinthians|3|20|and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.
1 Corinthians|3|21|Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|22|whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|23|and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
1 Corinthians|4|1|Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1 Corinthians|4|2|Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1 Corinthians|4|3|But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
1 Corinthians|4|4|For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
1 Corinthians|4|5|Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.
1 Corinthians|4|6|Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not {to go} beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.
1 Corinthians|4|7|For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?
1 Corinthians|4|8|Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1 Corinthians|4|9|For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.
1 Corinthians|4|10|We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.
1 Corinthians|4|11|Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;
1 Corinthians|4|12|and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;
1 Corinthians|4|13|being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.
1 Corinthians|4|14|I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
1 Corinthians|4|15|For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet {have ye} not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.
1 Corinthians|4|16|I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
1 Corinthians|4|17|For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.
1 Corinthians|4|18|Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
1 Corinthians|4|19|But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.
1 Corinthians|4|20|For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1 Corinthians|4|21|What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
1 Corinthians|5|1|It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one {of you} hath his father’s wife.
1 Corinthians|5|2|And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1 Corinthians|5|3|For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,
1 Corinthians|5|4|in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
1 Corinthians|5|5|to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1 Corinthians|5|6|Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians|5|7|Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, {even} Christ:
1 Corinthians|5|8|wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians|5|9|I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;
1 Corinthians|5|10|not at all {meaning} with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:
1 Corinthians|5|11|but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.
1 Corinthians|5|12|For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians|5|13|But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
1 Corinthians|6|1|Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
1 Corinthians|6|2|Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1 Corinthians|6|3|Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians|6|4|If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?
1 Corinthians|6|5|I say {this} to move you to shame. What, cannot there be {found} among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,
1 Corinthians|6|6|but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
1 Corinthians|6|7|Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?
1 Corinthians|6|8|Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that {your} brethren.
1 Corinthians|6|9|Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,
1 Corinthians|6|10|nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians|6|11|And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians|6|12|All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1 Corinthians|6|13|Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
1 Corinthians|6|14|and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.
1 Corinthians|6|15|Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.
1 Corinthians|6|16|Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.
1 Corinthians|6|17|But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians|6|18|Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1 Corinthians|6|19|Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;
1 Corinthians|6|20|for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.
1 Corinthians|7|1|Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians|7|2|But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
1 Corinthians|7|3|Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians|7|4|The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.
1 Corinthians|7|5|Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.
1 Corinthians|7|6|But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
1 Corinthians|7|7|Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1 Corinthians|7|8|But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1 Corinthians|7|9|But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1 Corinthians|7|10|But unto the married I give charge, {yea} not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband
1 Corinthians|7|11|(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.
1 Corinthians|7|12|But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
1 Corinthians|7|13|And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|14|For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1 Corinthians|7|15|Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such {cases}: but God hath called us in peace.
1 Corinthians|7|16|For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1 Corinthians|7|17|Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.
1 Corinthians|7|18|Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians|7|19|Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1 Corinthians|7|20|Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians|7|21|Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use {it} rather.
1 Corinthians|7|22|For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.
1 Corinthians|7|23|Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.
1 Corinthians|7|24|Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
1 Corinthians|7|25|Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.
1 Corinthians|7|26|I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, {namely,} that it is good for a man to be as he is.
1 Corinthians|7|27|Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians|7|28|But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.
1 Corinthians|7|29|But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;
1 Corinthians|7|30|and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;
1 Corinthians|7|31|and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
1 Corinthians|7|32|But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
1 Corinthians|7|33|but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
1 Corinthians|7|34|and is divided. {So} also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|35|And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1 Corinthians|7|36|But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin {daughter}, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.
1 Corinthians|7|37|But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin {daughter}, shall do well.
1 Corinthians|7|38|So then both he that giveth his own virgin {daughter} in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.
1 Corinthians|7|39|A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|7|40|But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians|8|1|Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
1 Corinthians|8|2|If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;
1 Corinthians|8|3|but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.
1 Corinthians|8|4|Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is {anything} in the world, and that there is no God but one.
1 Corinthians|8|5|For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
1 Corinthians|8|6|yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
1 Corinthians|8|7|Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as {of} a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians|8|8|But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
1 Corinthians|8|9|But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.
1 Corinthians|8|10|For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
1 Corinthians|8|11|For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
1 Corinthians|8|12|And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians|8|13|Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.
1 Corinthians|9|1|Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians|9|2|If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|9|3|My defence to them that examine me is this.
1 Corinthians|9|4|Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians|9|5|Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
1 Corinthians|9|6|Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?
1 Corinthians|9|7|What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians|9|8|Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?
1 Corinthians|9|9|For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,
1 Corinthians|9|10|or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, {to thresh} in hope of partaking.
1 Corinthians|9|11|If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?
1 Corinthians|9|12|If others partake of {this} right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians|9|13|Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat {of} the things of the temple, {and} they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|9|14|Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|15|But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for {it were} good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.
1 Corinthians|9|16|For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|17|For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.
1 Corinthians|9|18|What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|19|For though I was free from all {men,} I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
1 Corinthians|9|20|And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
1 Corinthians|9|21|to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.
1 Corinthians|9|22|To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
1 Corinthians|9|23|And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.
1 Corinthians|9|24|Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.
1 Corinthians|9|25|And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they {do it} to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians|9|26|I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:
1 Corinthians|9|27|but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
1 Corinthians|10|1|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|2|and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|3|and did all eat the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians|10|4|and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians|10|5|Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians|10|6|Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1 Corinthians|10|7|Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
1 Corinthians|10|8|Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1 Corinthians|10|9|Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.
1 Corinthians|10|10|Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
1 Corinthians|10|11|Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
1 Corinthians|10|12|Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians|10|13|There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.
1 Corinthians|10|14|Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians|10|15|I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians|10|16|The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians|10|17|seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.
1 Corinthians|10|18|Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|10|19|What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
1 Corinthians|10|20|But {I say}, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.
1 Corinthians|10|21|Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
1 Corinthians|10|22|Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians|10|23|All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.
1 Corinthians|10|24|Let no man seek his own, but {each} his neighbor’s {good}.
1 Corinthians|10|25|Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake,
1 Corinthians|10|26|for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
1 Corinthians|10|27|If one of them that believe not biddeth you {to a feast}, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
1 Corinthians|10|28|But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:
1 Corinthians|10|29|conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
1 Corinthians|10|30|If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians|10|31|Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
1 Corinthians|10|32|Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:
1 Corinthians|10|33|even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the {profit} of the many, that they may be saved.
1 Corinthians|11|1|Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1 Corinthians|11|2|Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
1 Corinthians|11|3|But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
1 Corinthians|11|4|Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
1 Corinthians|11|5|But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians|11|6|For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
1 Corinthians|11|7|For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1 Corinthians|11|8|For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:
1 Corinthians|11|9|for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:
1 Corinthians|11|10|for this cause ought the woman to have {a sign of} authority on her head, because of the angels.
1 Corinthians|11|11|Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|12|For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.
1 Corinthians|11|13|Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?
1 Corinthians|11|14|Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
1 Corinthians|11|15|But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
1 Corinthians|11|16|But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1 Corinthians|11|17|But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.
1 Corinthians|11|18|For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.
1 Corinthians|11|19|For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
1 Corinthians|11|20|When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:
1 Corinthians|11|21|for in your eating each one taketh before {other} his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1 Corinthians|11|22|What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.
1 Corinthians|11|23|For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;
1 Corinthians|11|24|and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|25|In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink {it}, in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|26|For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.
1 Corinthians|11|27|Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|28|But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
1 Corinthians|11|29|For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.
1 Corinthians|11|30|For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
1 Corinthians|11|31|But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.
1 Corinthians|11|32|But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
1 Corinthians|11|33|Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.
1 Corinthians|11|34|If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.
1 Corinthians|12|1|Now concerning spiritual {gifts}, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
1 Corinthians|12|2|Ye know that when ye were Gentiles {ye were} led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.
1 Corinthians|12|3|Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|4|Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|5|And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
1 Corinthians|12|6|And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.
1 Corinthians|12|7|But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
1 Corinthians|12|8|For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:
1 Corinthians|12|9|to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;
1 Corinthians|12|10|and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another {divers} kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:
1 Corinthians|12|11|but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
1 Corinthians|12|12|For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
1 Corinthians|12|13|For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|14|For the body is not one member, but many.
1 Corinthians|12|15|If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|16|And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|17|If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
1 Corinthians|12|18|But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
1 Corinthians|12|19|And if they were all one member, where were the body?
1 Corinthians|12|20|But now they are many members, but one body.
1 Corinthians|12|21|And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians|12|22|Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:
1 Corinthians|12|23|and those {parts} of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely {parts} have more abundant comeliness;
1 Corinthians|12|24|whereas our comely {parts} have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that {part} which lacked;
1 Corinthians|12|25|that there should be no schism in the body; but {that} the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians|12|26|And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or {one} member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
1 Corinthians|12|27|Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.
1 Corinthians|12|28|And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, {divers} kinds of tongues.
1 Corinthians|12|29|Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all {workers of} miracles?
1 Corinthians|12|30|have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians|12|31|But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.
1 Corinthians|13|1|If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians|13|2|And if I have {the gift of} prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|3|And if I bestow all my goods to feed {the poor}, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|4|Love suffereth long, {and} is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1 Corinthians|13|5|doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;
1 Corinthians|13|6|rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;
1 Corinthians|13|7|beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1 Corinthians|13|8|Love never faileth: but whether {there be} prophecies, they shall be done away; whether {there be} tongues, they shall cease; whether {there be} knowledge, it shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|9|For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
1 Corinthians|13|10|but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|11|When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.
1 Corinthians|13|12|For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.
1 Corinthians|13|13|But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
1 Corinthians|14|1|Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual {gifts}, but rather that ye may prophesy.
1 Corinthians|14|2|For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1 Corinthians|14|3|But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
1 Corinthians|14|4|He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians|14|5|Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|6|But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
1 Corinthians|14|7|Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1 Corinthians|14|8|For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
1 Corinthians|14|9|So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.
1 Corinthians|14|10|There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no {kind} is without signification.
1 Corinthians|14|11|If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.
1 Corinthians|14|12|So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual {gifts}, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.
1 Corinthians|14|13|Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians|14|14|For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians|14|15|What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1 Corinthians|14|16|Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?
1 Corinthians|14|17|For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1 Corinthians|14|18|I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:
1 Corinthians|14|19|howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians|14|20|Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.
1 Corinthians|14|21|In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|22|Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying {is for a sign}, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
1 Corinthians|14|23|If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?
1 Corinthians|14|24|But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;
1 Corinthians|14|25|the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
1 Corinthians|14|26|What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|27|If any man speaketh in a tongue, {let it be} by two, or at the most three, and {that} in turn; and let one interpret:
1 Corinthians|14|28|but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
1 Corinthians|14|29|And let the prophets speak {by} two or three, and let the others discern.
1 Corinthians|14|30|But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.
1 Corinthians|14|31|For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;
1 Corinthians|14|32|and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
1 Corinthians|14|33|for God is not {a God} of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
1 Corinthians|14|34|let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.
1 Corinthians|14|35|And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.
1 Corinthians|14|36|What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?
1 Corinthians|14|37|If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|38|But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1 Corinthians|14|39|Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
1 Corinthians|14|40|But let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians|15|1|Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,
1 Corinthians|15|2|by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.
1 Corinthians|15|3|For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|4|and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|5|and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;
1 Corinthians|15|6|then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;
1 Corinthians|15|7|then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;
1 Corinthians|15|8|and last of all, as to the {child} untimely born, he appeared to me also.
1 Corinthians|15|9|For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
1 Corinthians|15|10|But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1 Corinthians|15|11|Whether then {it be} I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1 Corinthians|15|12|Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians|15|13|But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|14|and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.
1 Corinthians|15|15|Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.
1 Corinthians|15|16|For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|17|and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
1 Corinthians|15|18|Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians|15|19|If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
1 Corinthians|15|20|But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.
1 Corinthians|15|21|For since by man {came} death, by man {came} also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians|15|22|For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians|15|23|But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.
1 Corinthians|15|24|Then {cometh} the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
1 Corinthians|15|25|For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians|15|26|The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians|15|27|For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.
1 Corinthians|15|28|And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians|15|29|Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
1 Corinthians|15|30|Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians|15|31|I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
1 Corinthians|15|32|If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
1 Corinthians|15|33|Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
1 Corinthians|15|34|Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak {this} to move you to shame.
1 Corinthians|15|35|But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?
1 Corinthians|15|36|Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:
1 Corinthians|15|37|and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;
1 Corinthians|15|38|but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
1 Corinthians|15|39|All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one {flesh} of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
1 Corinthians|15|40|There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the {glory} of the terrestrial is another.
1 Corinthians|15|41|There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
1 Corinthians|15|42|So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians|15|43|it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians|15|44|it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual {body}.
1 Corinthians|15|45|So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam {became} a life-giving spirit.
1 Corinthians|15|46|Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians|15|47|The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.
1 Corinthians|15|48|As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|49|And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|50|Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians|15|51|Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians|15|52|in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians|15|53|For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1 Corinthians|15|54|But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians|15|55|O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?
1 Corinthians|15|56|The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:
1 Corinthians|15|57|but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|15|58|Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|16|1|Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
1 Corinthians|16|2|Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
1 Corinthians|16|3|And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:
1 Corinthians|16|4|and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.
1 Corinthians|16|5|But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;
1 Corinthians|16|6|but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.
1 Corinthians|16|7|For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1 Corinthians|16|8|But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;
1 Corinthians|16|9|for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians|16|10|Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:
1 Corinthians|16|11|let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.
1 Corinthians|16|12|But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all {his} will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.
1 Corinthians|16|13|Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1 Corinthians|16|14|Let all that ye do be done in love.
1 Corinthians|16|15|Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),
1 Corinthians|16|16|that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.
1 Corinthians|16|17|And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.
1 Corinthians|16|18|For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.
1 Corinthians|16|19|The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1 Corinthians|16|20|All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians|16|21|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians|16|22|If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.
1 Corinthians|16|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians|16|24|My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Acts|1|1|The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
Acts|1|2|until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
Acts|1|3|To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:
Acts|1|4|and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, {said he}, ye heard from me:
Acts|1|5|For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
Acts|1|6|They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
Acts|1|7|And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority.
Acts|1|8|But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Acts|1|9|And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
Acts|1|10|And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
Acts|1|11|who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
Acts|1|12|Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey off.
Acts|1|13|And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James {the son} of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas {the son} of James.
Acts|1|14|These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
Acts|1|15|And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons {gathered} together, about a hundred and twenty),
Acts|1|16|Brethren, it was needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
Acts|1|17|For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.
Acts|1|18|(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
Acts|1|19|And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)
Acts|1|20|For it is written in the book of Psalms,             Let his habitation be made desolate,                   And let no man dwell therein:            and,             His office let another take.
Acts|1|21|Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
Acts|1|22|beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.
Acts|1|23|And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Acts|1|24|And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,
Acts|1|25|to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.
Acts|1|26|And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
Acts|2|1|And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.
Acts|2|2|And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Acts|2|3|And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.
Acts|2|4|And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Acts|2|5|Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
Acts|2|6|And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.
Acts|2|7|And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
Acts|2|8|And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
Acts|2|9|Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
Acts|2|10|in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts|2|11|Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.
Acts|2|12|And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
Acts|2|13|But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.
Acts|2|14|But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, {saying}, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.
Acts|2|15|For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is {but} the third hour of the day.
Acts|2|16|but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:
Acts|2|17|And it shall be in the last days, saith God,                   I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh:                   And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,                   And your young men shall see visions,                   And your old men shall dream dreams:
Acts|2|18|Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days                   Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
Acts|2|19|And I will show wonders in the heaven above,                   And signs on the earth beneath;                   Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:
Acts|2|20|The sun shall be turned into darkness,                   And the moon into blood,                   Before the day of the Lord come,                   That great and notable {day}.
Acts|2|21|And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Acts|2|22|Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;
Acts|2|23|him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:
Acts|2|24|whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
Acts|2|25|For David saith concerning him,             I beheld the Lord always before my face;                   For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
Acts|2|26|Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;                   Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:
Acts|2|27|Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades,                   Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.
Acts|2|28|Thou madest known unto me the ways of life;                   Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.
Acts|2|29|Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.
Acts|2|30|Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set {one} upon his throne;
Acts|2|31|he foreseeing {this} spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts|2|32|This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.
Acts|2|33|Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.
Acts|2|34|For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself,             The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Acts|2|35|Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Acts|2|36|Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
Acts|2|37|Now when they heard {this,} they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
Acts|2|38|And Peter {said} unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|2|39|For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, {even} as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.
Acts|2|40|And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
Acts|2|41|They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added {unto them} in that day about three thousand souls.
Acts|2|42|And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
Acts|2|43|And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
Acts|2|44|And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
Acts|2|45|and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.
Acts|2|46|And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
Acts|2|47|praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.
Acts|3|1|Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, {being} the ninth {hour}.
Acts|3|2|And a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
Acts|3|3|who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.
Acts|3|4|And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.
Acts|3|5|And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts|3|6|But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.
Acts|3|7|And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength.
Acts|3|8|And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
Acts|3|9|And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Acts|3|10|and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
Acts|3|11|And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
Acts|3|12|And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?
Acts|3|13|The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.
Acts|3|14|But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you,
Acts|3|15|and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
Acts|3|16|And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
Acts|3|17|And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
Acts|3|18|But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
Acts|3|19|Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;
Acts|3|20|and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, {even} Jesus:
Acts|3|21|whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old.
Acts|3|22|Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me. To him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.
Acts|3|23|And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Acts|3|24|Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
Acts|3|25|Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Acts|3|26|Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
Acts|4|1|And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
Acts|4|2|being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts|4|3|And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.
Acts|4|4|But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
Acts|4|5|And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
Acts|4|6|and Annas the high priest {was there}, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
Acts|4|7|And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?
Acts|4|8|Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,
Acts|4|9|if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;
Acts|4|10|be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, {even} in him doth this man stand here before you whole.
Acts|4|11|He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.
Acts|4|12|And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.
Acts|4|13|Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
Acts|4|14|And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
Acts|4|15|But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
Acts|4|16|saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
Acts|4|17|But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
Acts|4|18|And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Acts|4|19|But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:
Acts|4|20|for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.
Acts|4|21|And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.
Acts|4|22|For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.
Acts|4|23|And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.
Acts|4|24|And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:
Acts|4|25|who by the Holy Spirit, {by} the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say,             Why did the Gentiles rage,                   And the peoples imagine vain things?
Acts|4|26|The kings of the earth set themselves in array,                   And the rulers were gathered together,                   Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:
Acts|4|27|for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,
Acts|4|28|to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.
Acts|4|29|And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,
Acts|4|30|while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.
Acts|4|31|And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
Acts|4|32|And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one {of them} said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
Acts|4|33|And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Acts|4|34|For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
Acts|4|35|and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.
Acts|4|36|And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,
Acts|4|37|having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts|5|1|But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
Acts|5|2|and kept back {part} of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts|5|3|But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back {part} of the price of the land?
Acts|5|4|While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto God.
Acts|5|5|And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it.
Acts|5|6|And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.
Acts|5|7|And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
Acts|5|8|And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much.
Acts|5|9|But Peter {said} unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
Acts|5|10|And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
Acts|5|11|And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.
Acts|5|12|And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
Acts|5|13|But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them;
Acts|5|14|and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;
Acts|5|15|insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.
Acts|5|16|And there also came together the multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
Acts|5|17|But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
Acts|5|18|and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.
Acts|5|19|But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,
Acts|5|20|Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.
Acts|5|21|And when they heard {this}, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.
Acts|5|22|But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told,
Acts|5|23|saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
Acts|5|24|Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.
Acts|5|25|And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.
Acts|5|26|Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, {but} without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
Acts|5|27|And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
Acts|5|28|saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
Acts|5|29|But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.
Acts|5|30|The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.
Acts|5|31|Him did God exalt with his right hand {to be} a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
Acts|5|32|And we are witnesses of these things; and {so is} the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
Acts|5|33|But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and minded to slay them.
Acts|5|34|But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.
Acts|5|35|And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.
Acts|5|36|For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.
Acts|5|37|After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away {some of the} people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.
Acts|5|38|And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:
Acts|5|39|but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.
Acts|5|40|And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
Acts|5|41|They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.
Acts|5|42|And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus {as} the Christ.
Acts|6|1|Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Acts|6|2|And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.
Acts|6|3|Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
Acts|6|4|But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.
Acts|6|5|And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;
Acts|6|6|whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.
Acts|6|7|And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
Acts|6|8|And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.
Acts|6|9|But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called {the synagogue} of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
Acts|6|10|And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.
Acts|6|11|Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and {against} God.
Acts|6|12|And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,
Acts|6|13|and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:
Acts|6|14|for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.
Acts|6|15|And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
Acts|7|1|And the high priest said, Are these things so?
Acts|7|2|And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
Acts|7|3|and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
Acts|7|4|Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, {God} removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:
Acts|7|5|and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when {as yet} he had no child.
Acts|7|6|And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.
Acts|7|7|And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
Acts|7|8|And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so {Abraham} begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac {begat} Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
Acts|7|9|And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,
Acts|7|10|and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Acts|7|11|Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
Acts|7|12|But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.
Acts|7|13|And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.
Acts|7|14|And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
Acts|7|15|And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;
Acts|7|16|and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts|7|17|But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Acts|7|18|till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Acts|7|19|The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.
Acts|7|20|At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house.
Acts|7|21|and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
Acts|7|22|And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
Acts|7|23|But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
Acts|7|24|And seeing one {of them} suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:
Acts|7|25|and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.
Acts|7|26|And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
Acts|7|27|But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts|7|28|Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
Acts|7|29|And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
Acts|7|30|And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
Acts|7|31|And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,
Acts|7|32|I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
Acts|7|33|And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Acts|7|34|I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
Acts|7|35|This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent {to be} both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
Acts|7|36|This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
Acts|7|37|This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.
Acts|7|38|This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us:
Acts|7|39|to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,
Acts|7|40|saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Acts|7|41|And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
Acts|7|42|But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,             Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices                   Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
Acts|7|43|And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,                   And the star of the god Rephan,                   The figures which ye made to worship them:                   And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Acts|7|44|Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.
Acts|7|45|Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
Acts|7|46|who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts|7|47|But Solomon built him a house.
Acts|7|48|Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in {houses} made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Acts|7|49|The heaven is my throne,                   And the earth the footstool of my feet:                   What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord:                   Or what is the place of my rest?
Acts|7|50|Did not my hand make all these things?
Acts|7|51|Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.
Acts|7|52|Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers;
Acts|7|53|ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
Acts|7|54|Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
Acts|7|55|But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
Acts|7|56|and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.
Acts|7|57|But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;
Acts|7|58|and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts|7|59|And they stoned Stephen, calling upon {the Lord}, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Acts|7|60|And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Acts|8|1|And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts|8|2|And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
Acts|8|3|But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.
Acts|8|4|They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.
Acts|8|5|And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.
Acts|8|6|And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.
Acts|8|7|For {from} many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.
Acts|8|8|And there was much joy in that city.
Acts|8|9|But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
Acts|8|10|to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.
Acts|8|11|And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
Acts|8|12|But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Acts|8|13|And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.
Acts|8|14|Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
Acts|8|15|who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:
Acts|8|16|for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|8|17|Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|18|Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
Acts|8|19|saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|20|But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.
Acts|8|21|Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.
Acts|8|22|Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.
Acts|8|23|For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.
Acts|8|24|And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.
Acts|8|25|They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts|8|26|But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.
Acts|8|27|And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;
Acts|8|28|and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
Acts|8|29|And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
Acts|8|30|And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
Acts|8|31|And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts|8|32|Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this,             He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;                   And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb,                   So he openeth not his mouth:
Acts|8|33|In his humiliation his judgment was taken away:                   His generation who shall declare?                   For his life is taken from the earth.
Acts|8|34|And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?
Acts|8|35|And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.
Acts|8|36|And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, {here is} water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
Acts|8|37|{And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.}
Acts|8|38|And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
Acts|8|39|And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
Acts|8|40|But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
Acts|9|1|But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
Acts|9|2|and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts|9|3|And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven:
Acts|9|4|and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts|9|5|And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he {said}, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:
Acts|9|6|but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Acts|9|7|And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.
Acts|9|8|And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
Acts|9|9|And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
Acts|9|10|Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I {am here}, Lord.
Acts|9|11|And the Lord {said} unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth;
Acts|9|12|and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.
Acts|9|13|But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem:
Acts|9|14|and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
Acts|9|15|But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel:
Acts|9|16|for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
Acts|9|17|And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, {even} Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Acts|9|18|And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;
Acts|9|19|and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.
Acts|9|20|And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
Acts|9|21|And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.
Acts|9|22|But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
Acts|9|23|And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:
Acts|9|24|but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him:
Acts|9|25|but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
Acts|9|26|And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
Acts|9|27|But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts|9|28|And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,
Acts|9|29|preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.
Acts|9|30|And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Acts|9|31|So the church throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.
Acts|9|32|And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
Acts|9|33|And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.
Acts|9|34|And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise and make thy bed. And straightway he arose.
Acts|9|35|And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
Acts|9|36|Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
Acts|9|37|And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
Acts|9|38|And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.
Acts|9|39|And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
Acts|9|40|But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Acts|9|41|And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
Acts|9|42|And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.
Acts|9|43|And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
Acts|10|1|Now {there was} a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called the Italian {band},
Acts|10|2|a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.
Acts|10|3|He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
Acts|10|4|And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.
Acts|10|5|And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
Acts|10|6|he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.
Acts|10|7|And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
Acts|10|8|and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts|10|9|Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:
Acts|10|10|and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;
Acts|10|11|and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth:
Acts|10|12|wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.
Acts|10|13|And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
Acts|10|14|But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.
Acts|10|15|And a voice {came} unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.
Acts|10|16|And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.
Acts|10|17|Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate,
Acts|10|18|and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.
Acts|10|19|And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
Acts|10|20|But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them.
Acts|10|21|And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
Acts|10|22|And they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and one that feareth God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned {of God} by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.
Acts|10|23|So he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts|10|24|And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.
Acts|10|25|And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
Acts|10|26|But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
Acts|10|27|And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together:
Acts|10|28|and he said unto them, Ye yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or come unto one of another nation; and {yet} unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean:
Acts|10|29|wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me.
Acts|10|30|And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,
Acts|10|31|and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
Acts|10|32|Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.
Acts|10|33|Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord.
Acts|10|34|And Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
Acts|10|35|but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.
Acts|10|36|The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all.) --
Acts|10|37|that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
Acts|10|38|{even} Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
Acts|10|39|And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.
Acts|10|40|Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,
Acts|10|41|not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, {even} to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
Acts|10|42|And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God {to be} the Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts|10|43|To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.
Acts|10|44|While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.
Acts|10|45|And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|10|46|For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
Acts|10|47|Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
Acts|10|48|And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
Acts|11|1|Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts|11|2|And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
Acts|11|3|saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
Acts|11|4|But Peter began, and expounded {the matter} unto them in order, saying,
Acts|11|5|I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:
Acts|11|6|upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.
Acts|11|7|And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
Acts|11|8|But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.
Acts|11|9|But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.
Acts|11|10|And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
Acts|11|11|And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me.
Acts|11|12|And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man’s house:
Acts|11|13|and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Acts|11|14|who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.
Acts|11|15|And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
Acts|11|16|And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Acts|11|17|If then God gave unto them the like gift as {he did} also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?
Acts|11|18|And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.
Acts|11|19|They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.
Acts|11|20|But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
Acts|11|21|And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.
Acts|11|22|And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:
Acts|11|23|who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord:
Acts|11|24|for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
Acts|11|25|And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;
Acts|11|26|and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people, and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
Acts|11|27|Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
Acts|11|28|And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.
Acts|11|29|And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea:
Acts|11|30|which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
Acts|12|1|Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.
Acts|12|2|And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
Acts|12|3|And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. And {those} were the days of unleavened bread.
Acts|12|4|And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
Acts|12|5|Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.
Acts|12|6|And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.
Acts|12|7|And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
Acts|12|8|And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
Acts|12|9|And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.
Acts|12|10|And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.
Acts|12|11|And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
Acts|12|12|And when he had considered {the thing}, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.
Acts|12|13|And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.
Acts|12|14|And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.
Acts|12|15|And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.
Acts|12|16|But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.
Acts|12|17|But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.
Acts|12|18|Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
Acts|12|19|And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.
Acts|12|20|Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king’s country.
Acts|12|21|And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.
Acts|12|22|And the people shouted, {saying}, The voice of a god, and not of a man.
Acts|12|23|And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
Acts|12|24|But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Acts|12|25|And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministration, taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
Acts|13|1|Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was {there}, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
Acts|13|2|And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
Acts|13|3|Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
Acts|13|4|So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
Acts|13|5|And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.
Acts|13|6|And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;
Acts|13|7|who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|8|But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
Acts|13|9|But Saul, who is also {called} Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,
Acts|13|10|and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
Acts|13|11|And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Acts|13|12|Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
Acts|13|13|Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts|13|14|But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
Acts|13|15|And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
Acts|13|16|And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:
Acts|13|17|The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.
Acts|13|18|And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.
Acts|13|19|And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave {them} their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:
Acts|13|20|and after these things he gave {them} judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts|13|21|And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
Acts|13|22|And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall do all My will.
Acts|13|23|Of this man’s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;
Acts|13|24|when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts|13|25|And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not {he}. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
Acts|13|26|Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.
Acts|13|27|For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled {them} by condemning {him}.
Acts|13|28|And though they found no cause of death {in him}, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.
Acts|13|29|And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
Acts|13|30|But God raised him from the dead:
Acts|13|31|and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.
Acts|13|32|And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,
Acts|13|33|that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
Acts|13|34|And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure {blessings} of David.
Acts|13|35|Because he saith also in another {psalm}, Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption.
Acts|13|36|For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
Acts|13|37|but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.
Acts|13|38|Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:
Acts|13|39|and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Acts|13|40|Beware therefore, lest that come upon {you} which is spoken in the prophets:
Acts|13|41|Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish;                   For I work a work in your days,                   A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.
Acts|13|42|And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.
Acts|13|43|Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
Acts|13|44|And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|45|But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
Acts|13|46|And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
Acts|13|47|For so hath the Lord commanded us, {saying},             I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles,                   That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Acts|13|48|And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
Acts|13|49|And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.
Acts|13|50|But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.
Acts|13|51|But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
Acts|13|52|And the disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.
Acts|14|1|And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
Acts|14|2|But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.
Acts|14|3|Long time therefore they tarried {there} speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Acts|14|4|But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
Acts|14|5|And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,
Acts|14|6|they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:
Acts|14|7|and there they preached the gospel.
Acts|14|8|And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.
Acts|14|9|The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,
Acts|14|10|said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.
Acts|14|11|And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
Acts|14|12|And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
Acts|14|13|And the priest of Jupiter whose {temple} was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.
Acts|14|14|But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out
Acts|14|15|and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:
Acts|14|16|who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways.
Acts|14|17|And yet He left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
Acts|14|18|And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.
Acts|14|19|But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
Acts|14|20|But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts|14|21|And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
Acts|14|22|confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
Acts|14|23|And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
Acts|14|24|And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
Acts|14|25|And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;
Acts|14|26|and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
Acts|14|27|And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles.
Acts|14|28|And they tarried no little time with the disciples.
Acts|15|1|And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, {saying}, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
Acts|15|2|And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, {the brethren} appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
Acts|15|3|They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
Acts|15|4|And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.
Acts|15|5|But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.
Acts|15|6|And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.
Acts|15|7|And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
Acts|15|8|And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;
Acts|15|9|and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
Acts|15|10|Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Acts|15|11|But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.
Acts|15|12|And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.
Acts|15|13|And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:
Acts|15|14|Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
Acts|15|15|And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
Acts|15|16|After these things I will return,                   And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen;                   And I will build again the ruins thereof,                   And I will set it up:
Acts|15|17|That the residue of men may seek after the Lord,                   And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,
Acts|15|18|Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.
Acts|15|19|Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;
Acts|15|20|but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
Acts|15|21|For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.
Acts|15|22|Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; {namely}, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
Acts|15|23|and they wrote {thus} by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
Acts|15|24|Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;
Acts|15|25|it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts|15|26|men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|15|27|We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.
Acts|15|28|For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
Acts|15|29|that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.
Acts|15|30|So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.
Acts|15|31|And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.
Acts|15|32|And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
Acts|15|33|And after they had spent some time {there}, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.
Acts|15|34|{But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.}
Acts|15|35|But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Acts|15|36|And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, {and see} how they fare.
Acts|15|37|And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.
Acts|15|38|But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
Acts|15|39|And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;
Acts|15|40|but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
Acts|15|41|And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Acts|16|1|And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|2|The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts|16|3|Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|4|And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.
Acts|16|5|So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Acts|16|6|And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
Acts|16|7|and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;
Acts|16|8|and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts|16|9|And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Acts|16|10|And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts|16|11|Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
Acts|16|12|and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a {Roman} colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.
Acts|16|13|And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.
Acts|16|14|And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts|16|15|And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide {there}. And she constrained us.
Acts|16|16|And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
Acts|16|17|The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.
Acts|16|18|And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
Acts|16|19|But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,
Acts|16|20|and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Acts|16|21|and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.
Acts|16|22|And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.
Acts|16|23|And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Acts|16|24|who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Acts|16|25|But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
Acts|16|26|and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
Acts|16|27|And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts|16|28|But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Acts|16|29|And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,
Acts|16|30|and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts|16|31|And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
Acts|16|32|And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.
Acts|16|33|And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.
Acts|16|34|And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.
Acts|16|35|But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
Acts|16|36|And the jailor reported the words to Paul, {saying}, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.
Acts|16|37|But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.
Acts|16|38|And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;
Acts|16|39|and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.
Acts|16|40|And they went out of the prison, and entered into {the house} of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Acts|17|1|Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Acts|17|2|and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts|17|3|opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, {said he,} I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.
Acts|17|4|And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Acts|17|5|But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.
Acts|17|6|And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Acts|17|7|whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, {one} Jesus.
Acts|17|8|And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Acts|17|9|And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Acts|17|10|And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts|17|11|Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
Acts|17|12|Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.
Acts|17|13|But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.
Acts|17|14|And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.
Acts|17|15|But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
Acts|17|16|Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.
Acts|17|17|So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.
Acts|17|18|And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts|17|19|And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?
Acts|17|20|For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Acts|17|21|(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
Acts|17|22|And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.
Acts|17|23|For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.
Acts|17|24|The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Acts|17|25|neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Acts|17|26|and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined {their} appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;
Acts|17|27|that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:
Acts|17|28|for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Acts|17|29|Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.
Acts|17|30|The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:
Acts|17|31|inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Acts|17|32|Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.
Acts|17|33|Thus Paul went out from among them.
Acts|17|34|But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
Acts|18|1|After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
Acts|18|2|And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;
Acts|18|3|and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers.
Acts|18|4|And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
Acts|18|5|But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|18|6|And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood {be} upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
Acts|18|7|And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Acts|18|8|And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
Acts|18|9|And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:
Acts|18|10|for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.
Acts|18|11|And he dwelt {there} a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Acts|18|12|But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,
Acts|18|13|saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts|18|14|But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
Acts|18|15|but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.
Acts|18|16|And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
Acts|18|17|And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
Acts|18|18|And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.
Acts|18|19|And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts|18|20|And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;
Acts|18|21|but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.
Acts|18|22|And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.
Acts|18|23|And having spent some time {there}, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.
Acts|18|24|Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.
Acts|18|25|This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:
Acts|18|26|and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.
Acts|18|27|And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;
Acts|18|28|for he powerfully confuted the Jews, {and that} publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|19|1|And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:
Acts|19|2|and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they {said} unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was {given}.
Acts|19|3|And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.
Acts|19|4|And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
Acts|19|5|And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|19|6|And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
Acts|19|7|And they were in all about twelve men.
Acts|19|8|And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading {as to} the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts|19|9|But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
Acts|19|10|And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts|19|11|And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Acts|19|12|insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.
Acts|19|13|But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
Acts|19|14|And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.
Acts|19|15|And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?
Acts|19|16|And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts|19|17|And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts|19|18|Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
Acts|19|19|And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts|19|20|So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.
Acts|19|21|Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Acts|19|22|And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
Acts|19|23|And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
Acts|19|24|For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;
Acts|19|25|whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.
Acts|19|26|And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:
Acts|19|27|and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
Acts|19|28|And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.
Acts|19|29|And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.
Acts|19|30|And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
Acts|19|31|And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.
Acts|19|32|Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
Acts|19|33|And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.
Acts|19|34|But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts|19|35|And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the {image} which fell down from Jupiter?
Acts|19|36|Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
Acts|19|37|For ye have brought {hither} these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts|19|38|If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.
Acts|19|39|But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
Acts|19|40|For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day’s riot, there being no cause {for it}: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.
Acts|19|41|And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Acts|20|1|And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
Acts|20|2|And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
Acts|20|3|And when he had spent three months {there,} and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
Acts|20|4|And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, {the son} of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts|20|5|But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts|20|6|And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.
Acts|20|7|And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.
Acts|20|8|And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
Acts|20|9|And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Acts|20|10|And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.
Acts|20|11|And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
Acts|20|12|And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.
Acts|20|13|But we going before to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.
Acts|20|14|And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
Acts|20|15|And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.
Acts|20|16|For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
Acts|20|17|And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.
Acts|20|18|And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,
Acts|20|19|serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;
Acts|20|20|how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house,
Acts|20|21|testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|20|22|And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
Acts|20|23|save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
Acts|20|24|But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts|20|25|And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
Acts|20|26|Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
Acts|20|27|For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.
Acts|20|28|Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.
Acts|20|29|I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock;
Acts|20|30|and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts|20|31|Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.
Acts|20|32|And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build {you} up, and to give {you} the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
Acts|20|33|I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Acts|20|34|Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
Acts|20|35|In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Acts|20|36|And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
Acts|20|37|And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,
Acts|20|38|sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.
Acts|21|1|And when it came to pass that were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Acts|21|2|and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
Acts|21|3|And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Acts|21|4|And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts|21|5|And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;
Acts|21|6|and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.
Acts|21|7|And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Acts|21|8|And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.
Acts|21|9|Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.
Acts|21|10|And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Acts|21|11|And coming to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts|21|12|And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|13|Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|21|14|And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Acts|21|15|And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|16|And there went with us also {certain} of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing {with them} one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Acts|21|17|And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Acts|21|18|And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Acts|21|19|And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.
Acts|21|20|And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:
Acts|21|21|and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
Acts|21|22|What is it therefore? They will certainly hear that thou art come.
Acts|21|23|Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;
Acts|21|24|these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.
Acts|21|25|But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.
Acts|21|26|Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
Acts|21|27|And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,
Acts|21|28|crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.
Acts|21|29|For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
Acts|21|30|And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.
Acts|21|31|And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
Acts|21|32|And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.
Acts|21|33|Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.
Acts|21|34|And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.
Acts|21|35|And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;
Acts|21|36|for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.
Acts|21|37|And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?
Acts|21|38|Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?
Acts|21|39|But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.
Acts|21|40|And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,
Acts|22|1|Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.
Acts|22|2|And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,
Acts|22|3|I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day:
Acts|22|4|and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Acts|22|5|As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.
Acts|22|6|And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
Acts|22|7|And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts|22|8|And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Acts|22|9|And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Acts|22|10|And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Acts|22|11|And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus.
Acts|22|12|And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,
Acts|22|13|came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.
Acts|22|14|And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.
Acts|22|15|For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Acts|22|16|And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.
Acts|22|17|And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,
Acts|22|18|and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me.
Acts|22|19|And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
Acts|22|20|and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.
Acts|22|21|And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.
Acts|22|22|And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
Acts|22|23|And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,
Acts|22|24|the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.
Acts|22|25|And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Acts|22|26|And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.
Acts|22|27|And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.
Acts|22|28|And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am {a Roman} born.
Acts|22|29|They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Acts|22|30|But on the morrow, desiring to know the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
Acts|23|1|And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.
Acts|23|2|And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Acts|23|3|Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
Acts|23|4|And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Acts|23|5|And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.
Acts|23|6|But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
Acts|23|7|And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.
Acts|23|8|For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
Acts|23|9|And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?
Acts|23|10|And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.
Acts|23|11|And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
Acts|23|12|And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Acts|23|13|And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.
Acts|23|14|And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
Acts|23|15|Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.
Acts|23|16|But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.
Acts|23|17|And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.
Acts|23|18|So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.
Acts|23|19|And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?
Acts|23|20|And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.
Acts|23|21|Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.
Acts|23|22|So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.
Acts|23|23|And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:
Acts|23|24|and {he bade them} provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
Acts|23|25|And he wrote a letter after this form:
Acts|23|26|Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.
Acts|23|27|This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
Acts|23|28|And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:
Acts|23|29|whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts|23|30|And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.
Acts|23|31|So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts|23|32|But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
Acts|23|33|and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Acts|23|34|And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,
Acts|23|35|I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.
Acts|24|1|And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and {with} an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
Acts|24|2|And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,
Acts|24|3|we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts|24|4|But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.
Acts|24|5|For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
Acts|24|6|who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: {and we would have judged him according to our law.}
Acts|24|7|{But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,}
Acts|24|8|{commanding his accusers to come before thee.} from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.
Acts|24|9|And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.
Acts|24|10|And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:
Acts|24|11|Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:
Acts|24|12|and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
Acts|24|13|Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.
Acts|24|14|But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
Acts|24|15|having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.
Acts|24|16|Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.
Acts|24|17|Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:
Acts|24|18|amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but {there were} certain Jews from Asia--
Acts|24|19|who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.
Acts|24|20|Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,
Acts|24|21|except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.
Acts|24|22|But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.
Acts|24|23|And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.
Acts|24|24|But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
Acts|24|25|And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.
Acts|24|26|He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
Acts|24|27|But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
Acts|25|1|Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Acts|25|2|And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,
Acts|25|3|asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.
Acts|25|4|Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart {thither} shortly.
Acts|25|5|Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.
Acts|25|6|And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
Acts|25|7|And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;
Acts|25|8|while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.
Acts|25|9|But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
Acts|25|10|But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar’s judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.
Acts|25|11|If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is {true} whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
Acts|25|12|Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.
Acts|25|13|Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus.
Acts|25|14|And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
Acts|25|15|about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed {me}, asking for sentence against him.
Acts|25|16|To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
Acts|25|17|When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.
Acts|25|18|Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;
Acts|25|19|but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Acts|25|20|And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.
Acts|25|21|But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar.
Acts|25|22|And Agrippa {said} unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.
Acts|25|23|So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.
Acts|25|24|And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts|25|25|But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.
Acts|25|26|Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.
Acts|25|27|For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.
Acts|26|1|And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:
Acts|26|2|I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:
Acts|26|3|especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Acts|26|4|My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
Acts|26|5|having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
Acts|26|6|And now I stand {here} to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;
Acts|26|7|unto which {promise} our twelve tribes, earnestly serving {God} night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!
Acts|26|8|Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?
Acts|26|9|I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts|26|10|And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
Acts|26|11|And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.
Acts|26|12|Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
Acts|26|13|at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.
Acts|26|14|And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.
Acts|26|15|And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
Acts|26|16|But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;
Acts|26|17|delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,
Acts|26|18|to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.
Acts|26|19|Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
Acts|26|20|but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
Acts|26|21|For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.
Acts|26|22|Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;
Acts|26|23|how that the Christ must suffer, {and} how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.
Acts|26|24|And as he thus made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.
Acts|26|25|But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.
Acts|26|26|For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.
Acts|26|27|King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
Acts|26|28|And Agrippa {said} unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.
Acts|26|29|And Paul {said}, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.
Acts|26|30|And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
Acts|26|31|and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts|26|32|And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
Acts|27|1|And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.
Acts|27|2|And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Acts|27|3|And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.
Acts|27|4|And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
Acts|27|5|And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, {a city} of Lycia.
Acts|27|6|And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.
Acts|27|7|And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;
Acts|27|8|and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
Acts|27|9|And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,
Acts|27|10|and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.
Acts|27|11|But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts|27|12|And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter {there; which is} a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.
Acts|27|13|And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.
Acts|27|14|But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:
Acts|27|15|and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way {to it,} and were driven.
Acts|27|16|And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:
Acts|27|17|and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.
Acts|27|18|And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the {the freight} overboard;
Acts|27|19|and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
Acts|27|20|And when neither sun nor stars shone upon {us} for many days, and no small tempest lay on {us,} all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.
Acts|27|21|And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
Acts|27|22|And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but {only} of the ship.
Acts|27|23|For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,
Acts|27|24|saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.
Acts|27|25|Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.
Acts|27|26|But we must be cast upon a certain island.
Acts|27|27|But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the {sea of} Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:
Acts|27|28|and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.
Acts|27|29|And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.
Acts|27|30|And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,
Acts|27|31|Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Acts|27|32|Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
Acts|27|33|And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
Acts|27|34|Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.
Acts|27|35|And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.
Acts|27|36|Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.
Acts|27|37|And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Acts|27|38|And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts|27|39|And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.
Acts|27|40|And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
Acts|27|41|But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence {of the waves}.
Acts|27|42|And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any {of them} should swim out, and escape.
Acts|27|43|But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;
Acts|27|44|and the rest, some on planks, and some on {other} things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.
Acts|28|1|And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.
Acts|28|2|And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Acts|28|3|But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Acts|28|4|And when the barbarians saw the {venomous} creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.
Acts|28|5|Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.
Acts|28|6|But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
Acts|28|7|Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.
Acts|28|8|And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.
Acts|28|9|And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:
Acts|28|10|who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.
Acts|28|11|And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.
Acts|28|12|And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
Acts|28|13|And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;
Acts|28|14|where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.
Acts|28|15|And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
Acts|28|16|And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
Acts|28|17|And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
Acts|28|18|who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.
Acts|28|19|But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.
Acts|28|20|For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with {me}: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Acts|28|21|And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.
Acts|28|22|But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.
Acts|28|23|And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded {the matter,} testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.
Acts|28|24|And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
Acts|28|25|And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,
Acts|28|26|saying,             Go thou unto this people, and say,                   By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;                   And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
Acts|28|27|For this people’s heart is waxed gross,                   And their ears are dull of hearing,                   And their eyes they have closed;                   Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes,                   And hear with their ears,                   And understand with their heart,                   And should turn again,                   And I should heal them.
Acts|28|28|Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.
Acts|28|29|{And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.}
Acts|28|30|And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,
Acts|28|31|preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.
Micah|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Micah|1|2|Hear, ye peoples, all of you: hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
Micah|1|3|For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
Micah|1|4|And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.
Micah|1|5|For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
Micah|1|6|Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, {and} as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.
Micah|1|7|And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.
Micah|1|8|For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.
Micah|1|9|For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
Micah|1|10|Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.
Micah|1|11|Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.
Micah|1|12|For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah|1|13|Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
Micah|1|14|Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
Micah|1|15|I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.
Micah|1|16|Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
Micah|2|1|Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
Micah|2|2|And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
Micah|2|3|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
Micah|2|4|In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, {and} say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove {it} from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.
Micah|2|5|Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.
Micah|2|6|Prophesy ye not, {thus} they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.
Micah|2|7|Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
Micah|2|8|But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely {as men} averse from war.
Micah|2|9|The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.
Micah|2|10|Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.
Micah|2|11|If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, {saying}, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
Micah|2|12|I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of {the multitude of} men.
Micah|2|13|The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.
Micah|3|1|And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
Micah|3|2|ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Micah|3|3|who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
Micah|3|4|Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.
Micah|3|5|Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
Micah|3|6|Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
Micah|3|7|And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.
Micah|3|8|But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Micah|3|9|Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.
Micah|3|10|They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Micah|3|11|The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
Micah|3|12|Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
Micah|4|1|But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.
Micah|4|2|And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;
Micah|4|3|and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Micah|4|4|But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.
Micah|4|5|For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.
Micah|4|6|In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;
Micah|4|7|and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.
Micah|4|8|And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Micah|4|9|Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?
Micah|4|10|Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
