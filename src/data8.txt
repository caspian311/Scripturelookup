Matthew|18|9|And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
Matthew|18|10|See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|11|{For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.}
Matthew|18|12|How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray?
Matthew|18|13|And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray.
Matthew|18|14|Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
Matthew|18|15|And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
Matthew|18|16|But if he hear {thee} not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established.
Matthew|18|17|And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican.
Matthew|18|18|Verily I say unto you, what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|18|19|Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|20|For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
Matthew|18|21|Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?
Matthew|18|22|Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.
Matthew|18|23|Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants.
Matthew|18|24|And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
Matthew|18|25|But forasmuch as he had not {wherewith} to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
Matthew|18|26|The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew|18|27|And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
Matthew|18|28|But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold on him, and took {him} by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.
Matthew|18|29|So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
Matthew|18|30|And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due.
Matthew|18|31|So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
Matthew|18|32|Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me:
Matthew|18|33|shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?
Matthew|18|34|And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.
Matthew|18|35|So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
Matthew|19|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
Matthew|19|2|and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
Matthew|19|3|And there came unto him Pharisees, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful {for a man} to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew|19|4|And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made {them} from the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew|19|5|and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?
Matthew|19|6|So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Matthew|19|7|They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put {her} away?
Matthew|19|8|He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.
Matthew|19|9|And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.
Matthew|19|10|The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
Matthew|19|11|But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.
Matthew|19|12|For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
Matthew|19|13|Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew|19|14|But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|15|And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
Matthew|19|16|And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew|19|17|And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew|19|18|He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Matthew|19|19|Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|19|20|The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?
Matthew|19|21|Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Matthew|19|22|But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.
Matthew|19|23|And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|24|And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew|19|25|And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?
Matthew|19|26|And Jesus looking upon {them} said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
Matthew|19|27|Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?
Matthew|19|28|And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew|19|29|And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
Matthew|19|30|But many shall be last {that are} first; and first {that are} last.
Matthew|20|1|For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|2|And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|3|And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;
Matthew|20|4|and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Matthew|20|5|Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
Matthew|20|6|And about the eleventh {hour} he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Matthew|20|7|They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
Matthew|20|8|And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Matthew|20|9|And when they came that {were hired} about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|10|And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|11|And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,
Matthew|20|12|saying, These last have spent {but} one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
Matthew|20|13|But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?
Matthew|20|14|Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Matthew|20|15|Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Matthew|20|16|So the last shall be first, and the first last.
Matthew|20|17|And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,
Matthew|20|18|Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,
Matthew|20|19|and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.
Matthew|20|20|Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping {him}, and asking a certain thing of him.
Matthew|20|21|And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.
Matthew|20|22|But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.
Matthew|20|23|He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on {my} left hand, is not mine to give; but {it is for them} for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.
Matthew|20|24|And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.
Matthew|20|25|But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Matthew|20|26|Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;
Matthew|20|27|and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:
Matthew|20|28|even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Matthew|20|29|And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Matthew|20|30|And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|31|And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|32|And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?
Matthew|20|33|They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew|20|34|And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.
Matthew|21|1|And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
Matthew|21|2|saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose {them}, and bring {them} unto me.
Matthew|21|3|And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Matthew|21|4|Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
Matthew|21|5|Tell ye the daughter of Zion,                   Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,                   Meek, and riding upon an ass,                   And upon a colt the foal of an ass.
Matthew|21|6|And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,
Matthew|21|7|and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.
Matthew|21|8|And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.
Matthew|21|9|And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
