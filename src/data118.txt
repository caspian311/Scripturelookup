Amos|7|9|and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Amos|7|10|Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos|7|11|For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos|7|12|Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
Amos|7|13|but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.
Amos|7|14|Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:
Amos|7|15|and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
Amos|7|16|Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not {thy word} against the house of Isaac;
Amos|7|17|therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos|8|1|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
Amos|8|2|And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
Amos|8|3|And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.
Amos|8|4|Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,
Amos|8|5|saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
Amos|8|6|that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
Amos|8|7|Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Amos|8|8|Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
Amos|8|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
Amos|8|10|And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
Amos|8|11|Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.
Amos|8|12|And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it.
Amos|8|13|In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.
Amos|8|14|They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; they shall fall, and never rise up again.
Amos|9|1|I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.
Amos|9|2|Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
Amos|9|3|And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
Amos|9|4|And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
Amos|9|5|For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, {is} he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;
Amos|9|6|{it is} he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.
Amos|9|7|Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
Amos|9|8|Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.
Amos|9|9|For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as {grain} is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.
Amos|9|10|All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.
Amos|9|11|In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
Amos|9|12|that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this.
Amos|9|13|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
Amos|9|14|And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
Amos|9|15|And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God.
Joshua|1|1|Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,
Joshua|1|2|Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
Joshua|1|3|Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.
Joshua|1|4|From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
Joshua|1|5|There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Joshua|1|6|Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
Joshua|1|7|Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua|1|8|This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
Joshua|1|9|Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua|1|10|Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua|1|11|Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.
Joshua|1|12|And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
Joshua|1|13|Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.
Joshua|1|14|Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;
Joshua|1|15|until Jehovah have given your brethren rest, as {he hath given} you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|1|16|And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.
Joshua|1|17|According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
Joshua|1|18|Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.
Joshua|2|1|And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.
Joshua|2|2|And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.
Joshua|2|3|And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.
Joshua|2|4|And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:
Joshua|2|5|and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
Joshua|2|6|But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
Joshua|2|7|And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they that pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
Joshua|2|8|And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
Joshua|2|9|and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
Joshua|2|10|For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
Joshua|2|11|And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
Joshua|2|12|Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token;
Joshua|2|13|and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
Joshua|2|14|And the men said unto her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business; and it shall be, when Jehovah giveth us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
Joshua|2|15|Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
Joshua|2|16|And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
Joshua|2|17|And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|18|Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.
Joshua|2|19|And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
Joshua|2|20|But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|21|And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
Joshua|2|22|And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
Joshua|2|23|Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.
Joshua|2|24|And they said unto Joshua, Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land do melt away before us.
Joshua|3|1|And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.
Joshua|3|2|And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua|3|3|and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
Joshua|3|4|Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
Joshua|3|5|And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.
Joshua|3|6|And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
Joshua|3|7|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
Joshua|3|8|And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
Joshua|3|9|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
Joshua|3|10|And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua|3|11|Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.
Joshua|3|12|Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
Joshua|3|13|And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in one heap.
Joshua|3|14|And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;
Joshua|3|15|and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
Joshua|3|16|that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
Joshua|3|17|And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.
Joshua|4|1|And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|4|2|Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Joshua|4|3|and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.
