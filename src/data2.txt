1 Chronicles|15|9|of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore;
1 Chronicles|15|10|of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
1 Chronicles|15|11|And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
1 Chronicles|15|12|and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto {the place} that I have prepared for it.
1 Chronicles|15|13|For because ye {bare it} not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.
1 Chronicles|15|14|So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles|15|15|And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|15|16|And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.
1 Chronicles|15|17|So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
1 Chronicles|15|18|and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.
1 Chronicles|15|19|So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, {were appointed} with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;
1 Chronicles|15|20|and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth;
1 Chronicles|15|21|and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.
1 Chronicles|15|22|And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.
1 Chronicles|15|23|And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1 Chronicles|15|24|And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1 Chronicles|15|25|So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
1 Chronicles|15|26|And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.
1 Chronicles|15|27|And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song {with} the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.
1 Chronicles|15|28|Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.
1 Chronicles|15|29|And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
1 Chronicles|16|1|And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
1 Chronicles|16|2|And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|16|3|And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion {of flesh}, and a cake of raisins.
1 Chronicles|16|4|And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:
1 Chronicles|16|5|Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
1 Chronicles|16|6|and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Chronicles|16|7|Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
1 Chronicles|16|8|O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name;                   Make known his doings among the peoples.
1 Chronicles|16|9|Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;                   Talk ye of all his marvellous works.
1 Chronicles|16|10|Glory ye in his holy name;                   Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|16|11|Seek ye Jehovah and his strength;                   Seek his face evermore.
1 Chronicles|16|12|Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,                   His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
1 Chronicles|16|13|O ye seed of Israel his servant,                   Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1 Chronicles|16|14|He is Jehovah our God;                   His judgments are in all the earth.
1 Chronicles|16|15|Remember his covenant for ever,                   The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
1 Chronicles|16|16|{The covenant} which he made with Abraham,                   And his oath unto Isaac,
1 Chronicles|16|17|And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute,                   To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
1 Chronicles|16|18|Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,                   The lot of your inheritance;
1 Chronicles|16|19|When ye were but a few men in number,                   Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;
1 Chronicles|16|20|And they went about from nation to nation,                   And from one kingdom to another people.
1 Chronicles|16|21|He suffered no man to do them wrong;                   Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1 Chronicles|16|22|{Saying}, Touch not mine anointed ones,                   And do my prophets no harm.
1 Chronicles|16|23|Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth;                   Show forth his salvation from day to day.
1 Chronicles|16|24|Declare his glory among the nations,                   His marvellous works among all the peoples.
1 Chronicles|16|25|For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised:                   He also is to be feared above all gods.
1 Chronicles|16|26|For all the gods of the peoples are idols:                   But Jehovah made the heavens.
1 Chronicles|16|27|Honor and majesty are before him:                   Strength and gladness are in his place.
1 Chronicles|16|28|Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples,                   Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;
1 Chronicles|16|29|Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name:                   Bring an offering, and come before him:                   Worship Jehovah in holy array.
1 Chronicles|16|30|Tremble before him, all the earth:                   The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
1 Chronicles|16|31|Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;                   And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.
1 Chronicles|16|32|Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;                   Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
1 Chronicles|16|33|Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah;                   For he cometh to judge the earth.
1 Chronicles|16|34|O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;                   For his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever.
1 Chronicles|16|35|And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation,                   And gather us together and deliver us from the nations,                   To give thanks unto thy holy name,                   And to triumph in thy praise.
1 Chronicles|16|36|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,                   From everlasting even to everlasting.            And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|16|37|So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;
1 Chronicles|16|38|and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;
1 Chronicles|16|39|and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,
1 Chronicles|16|40|to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;
1 Chronicles|16|41|and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever;
1 Chronicles|16|42|and with them Heman and Jeduthun {with} trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and {with} instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
1 Chronicles|16|43|And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
1 Chronicles|17|1|And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah {dwelleth} under curtains.
1 Chronicles|17|2|And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.
1 Chronicles|17|3|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1 Chronicles|17|4|Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
1 Chronicles|17|5|for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from {one} tabernacle {to another}.
1 Chronicles|17|6|In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
1 Chronicles|17|7|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:
1 Chronicles|17|8|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
1 Chronicles|17|9|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
1 Chronicles|17|10|and {as} from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.
1 Chronicles|17|11|And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1 Chronicles|17|12|He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|13|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
1 Chronicles|17|14|but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|15|According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1 Chronicles|17|16|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
1 Chronicles|17|17|And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
1 Chronicles|17|18|What can David {say} yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
1 Chronicles|17|19|O Jehovah, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all {these} great things.
1 Chronicles|17|20|O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
1 Chronicles|17|21|And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?
1 Chronicles|17|22|For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
1 Chronicles|17|23|And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
1 Chronicles|17|24|And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.
1 Chronicles|17|25|For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found {in his heart} to pray before thee.
1 Chronicles|17|26|And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
1 Chronicles|17|27|and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.
1 Chronicles|18|1|And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles|18|2|And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
1 Chronicles|18|3|And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
1 Chronicles|18|4|And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
1 Chronicles|18|5|And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1 Chronicles|18|6|Then David put {garrisons} in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
1 Chronicles|18|7|And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|18|8|And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1 Chronicles|18|9|And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
1 Chronicles|18|10|he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and {he had with him} all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
1 Chronicles|18|11|These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
1 Chronicles|18|12|Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
1 Chronicles|18|13|And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
1 Chronicles|18|14|And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
1 Chronicles|18|15|And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
1 Chronicles|18|16|and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1 Chronicles|18|17|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
1 Chronicles|19|1|And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles|19|2|And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1 Chronicles|19|3|But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
1 Chronicles|19|4|So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
1 Chronicles|19|5|Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
1 Chronicles|19|6|And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
1 Chronicles|19|7|So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
1 Chronicles|19|8|And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1 Chronicles|19|9|And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
1 Chronicles|19|10|Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles|19|11|And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1 Chronicles|19|12|And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
1 Chronicles|19|13|Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
1 Chronicles|19|14|So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles|19|15|And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|19|16|And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
1 Chronicles|19|17|And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1 Chronicles|19|18|And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians {the men of} seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
1 Chronicles|19|19|And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1 Chronicles|20|1|And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out {to battle}, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.
1 Chronicles|20|2|And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
1 Chronicles|20|3|And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut {them} with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|20|4|And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
1 Chronicles|20|5|And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
1 Chronicles|20|6|And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six {on each hand}, and six {on each foot}; and he also was born unto the giant.
1 Chronicles|20|7|And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.
1 Chronicles|20|8|These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1 Chronicles|21|1|And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles|21|2|And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.
1 Chronicles|21|3|And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?
1 Chronicles|21|4|Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|21|5|And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
1 Chronicles|21|6|But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1 Chronicles|21|7|And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
1 Chronicles|21|8|And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1 Chronicles|21|9|And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,
1 Chronicles|21|10|Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
1 Chronicles|21|11|So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:
1 Chronicles|21|12|either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
1 Chronicles|21|13|And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
1 Chronicles|21|14|So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
1 Chronicles|21|15|And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles|21|16|And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
1 Chronicles|21|17|And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.
1 Chronicles|21|18|Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles|21|19|And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|21|20|And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1 Chronicles|21|21|And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1 Chronicles|21|22|Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
1 Chronicles|21|23|And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give {thee} the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.
1 Chronicles|21|24|And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.
1 Chronicles|21|25|So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1 Chronicles|21|26|And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
1 Chronicles|21|27|And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
1 Chronicles|21|28|At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
1 Chronicles|21|29|For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles|21|30|But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|22|1|Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.
1 Chronicles|22|2|And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1 Chronicles|22|3|And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;
1 Chronicles|22|4|and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.
1 Chronicles|22|5|And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
1 Chronicles|22|6|Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles|22|7|And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.
1 Chronicles|22|8|But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
1 Chronicles|22|9|Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days:
1 Chronicles|22|10|he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1 Chronicles|22|11|Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.
1 Chronicles|22|12|Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.
1 Chronicles|22|13|Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.
1 Chronicles|22|14|Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
1 Chronicles|22|15|Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:
1 Chronicles|22|16|of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.
1 Chronicles|22|17|David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, {saying},
1 Chronicles|22|18|Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
1 Chronicles|22|19|Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|23|1|Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1 Chronicles|23|2|And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles|23|3|And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
1 Chronicles|23|4|Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;
1 Chronicles|23|5|and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, {said David}, to praise therewith.
1 Chronicles|23|6|And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1 Chronicles|23|7|Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles|23|8|The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1 Chronicles|23|9|The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of Ladan.
1 Chronicles|23|10|And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1 Chronicles|23|11|And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.
1 Chronicles|23|12|The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1 Chronicles|23|13|The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.
1 Chronicles|23|14|But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
1 Chronicles|23|15|The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
1 Chronicles|23|16|The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
1 Chronicles|23|17|And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

1 Chronicles|23|21|The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
1 Chronicles|23|22|And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them {to wife}.
1 Chronicles|23|23|The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1 Chronicles|23|24|These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.
1 Chronicles|23|25|For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:
1 Chronicles|23|26|and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.
1 Chronicles|23|27|For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
1 Chronicles|23|28|For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;
1 Chronicles|23|29|for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;
1 Chronicles|23|30|and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;
1 Chronicles|23|31|and to offer all burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;
1 Chronicles|23|32|and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|24|1|And the courses of the sons of Aaron {were these}. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
1 Chronicles|24|2|But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.
1 Chronicles|24|3|And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.
1 Chronicles|24|4|And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and {thus} were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.
1 Chronicles|24|5|Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
1 Chronicles|24|6|And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

1 Chronicles|24|31|These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ {houses} of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
1 Chronicles|25|1|Moreover David and the captains of the host set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:

1 Chronicles|28|9|And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.

1 Chronicles|28|15|by weight also for the candlesticks of gold, and for the lamps thereof, of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps thereof; and for the candlesticks of silver, {silver} by weight for {every} candlestick and for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick;
1 Chronicles|28|16|and the gold by weight for the tables of showbread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
1 Chronicles|28|17|and the flesh-hooks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
1 Chronicles|28|18|and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, {even} the cherubim, that spread out {their wings}, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|28|19|All this, {said David}, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern.
1 Chronicles|28|20|And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be finished.
1 Chronicles|28|21|And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
1 Chronicles|29|1|And David the king said unto all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.
1 Chronicles|29|2|Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the {things of} gold, and the silver for the {things of} silver, and the brass for the {things of} brass, the iron for the {things of} iron, and wood for the {things of} wood; onyx stones, and {stones} to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
1 Chronicles|29|3|Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
1 Chronicles|29|4|even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;
1 Chronicles|29|5|of gold for the {things of} gold, and of silver for the {things of} silver, and for all manner of work {to be made} by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?
1 Chronicles|29|6|Then the princes of the fathers’ {houses}, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;
1 Chronicles|29|7|and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
1 Chronicles|29|8|And they with whom {precious} stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles|29|9|Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
1 Chronicles|29|10|Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
1 Chronicles|29|11|Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth {is thine}; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.
1 Chronicles|29|12|Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
1 Chronicles|29|13|Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1 Chronicles|29|14|But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
1 Chronicles|29|15|For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
1 Chronicles|29|16|O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own.
1 Chronicles|29|17|I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto thee.
1 Chronicles|29|18|O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;
1 Chronicles|29|19|and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
1 Chronicles|29|20|And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.
1 Chronicles|29|21|And they sacrificed sacrifices unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
1 Chronicles|29|22|and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness.      And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
1 Chronicles|29|23|Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
1 Chronicles|29|24|And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
1 Chronicles|29|25|And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
1 Chronicles|29|26|Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles|29|27|And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three {years} reigned he in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|29|28|And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles|29|29|Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
1 Chronicles|29|30|with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Samuel|1|1|And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
2 Samuel|1|2|it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
2 Samuel|1|3|And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
2 Samuel|1|4|And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
2 Samuel|1|5|And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
2 Samuel|1|6|And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
2 Samuel|1|7|And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
2 Samuel|1|8|And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
2 Samuel|1|9|And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
2 Samuel|1|10|So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
2 Samuel|1|11|Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
2 Samuel|1|12|and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
2 Samuel|1|13|And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
2 Samuel|1|14|And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?
2 Samuel|1|15|And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.
2 Samuel|1|16|And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.
2 Samuel|1|17|And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
2 Samuel|1|18|(and he bade them teach the children of Judah {the song of} the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
2 Samuel|1|19|Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!                   How are the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel|1|20|Tell it not in Gath,                   Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;                   Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,                   Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2 Samuel|1|21|Ye mountains of Gilboa,                   Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:                   For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,                   The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
2 Samuel|1|22|From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,                   The bow of Jonathan turned not back,                   And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2 Samuel|1|23|Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,                   And in their death they were not divided:                   They were swifter than eagles,                   They were stronger than lions.
2 Samuel|1|24|Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,                   Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,                   Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2 Samuel|1|25|How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!                   Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
2 Samuel|1|26|I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:                   Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:                   Thy love to me was wonderful,                   Passing the love of women.
2 Samuel|1|27|How are the mighty fallen,                   And the weapons of war perished!
2 Samuel|2|1|And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|2|So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
2 Samuel|2|3|And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|4|And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.      And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.
2 Samuel|2|5|And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
2 Samuel|2|6|And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
2 Samuel|2|7|Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2 Samuel|2|8|Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
2 Samuel|2|9|and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
2 Samuel|2|10|Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel|2|11|And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel|2|12|And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|13|And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2 Samuel|2|14|And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
2 Samuel|2|15|Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2 Samuel|2|16|And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and {thrust} his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|17|And the battle was very sore that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2 Samuel|2|18|And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2 Samuel|2|19|And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel|2|20|Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.
2 Samuel|2|21|And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
2 Samuel|2|22|And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
2 Samuel|2|23|Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
2 Samuel|2|24|But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|25|And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
2 Samuel|2|26|Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
2 Samuel|2|27|And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.
2 Samuel|2|28|So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2 Samuel|2|29|And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
2 Samuel|2|30|And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.
2 Samuel|2|31|But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, {so that} three hundred and threescore men died.
2 Samuel|2|32|And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.
2 Samuel|3|1|Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
2 Samuel|3|2|And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2 Samuel|3|3|and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2 Samuel|3|4|and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2 Samuel|3|5|and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2 Samuel|3|6|And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
2 Samuel|3|7|Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and {Ish-bosheth} said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?
2 Samuel|3|8|Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.
2 Samuel|3|9|God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;
2 Samuel|3|10|to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|3|11|And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
2 Samuel|3|12|And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying {also}, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
2 Samuel|3|13|And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
2 Samuel|3|14|And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|3|15|And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.
2 Samuel|3|16|And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.
2 Samuel|3|17|And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:
2 Samuel|3|18|now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
2 Samuel|3|19|And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel|3|20|So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
2 Samuel|3|21|And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2 Samuel|3|22|And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|23|When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|24|Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
2 Samuel|3|25|Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
2 Samuel|3|26|And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
2 Samuel|3|27|And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
2 Samuel|3|28|And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
2 Samuel|3|29|let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.
2 Samuel|3|30|So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2 Samuel|3|31|And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
2 Samuel|3|32|And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
2 Samuel|3|33|And the king lamented for Abner, and said,             Should Abner die as a fool dieth?
2 Samuel|3|34|Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:                   As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.            And all the people wept again over him.
2 Samuel|3|35|And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.
2 Samuel|3|36|And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
2 Samuel|3|37|So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
2 Samuel|3|38|And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
2 Samuel|3|39|And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.
2 Samuel|4|1|And when {Ish-bosheth}, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
2 Samuel|4|2|And {Ish-bosheth}, Saul’s son, {had} two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
2 Samuel|4|3|and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).
2 Samuel|4|4|Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel|4|5|And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
2 Samuel|4|6|And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2 Samuel|4|7|Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
2 Samuel|4|8|And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
2 Samuel|4|9|And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
2 Samuel|4|10|when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.
2 Samuel|4|11|How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
2 Samuel|4|12|And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
2 Samuel|5|1|Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2 Samuel|5|2|In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|3|So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|4|David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
2 Samuel|5|5|In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel|5|6|And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.
2 Samuel|5|7|Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
2 Samuel|5|8|And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and {smite} the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.
2 Samuel|5|9|And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
2 Samuel|5|10|And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.
2 Samuel|5|11|And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
2 Samuel|5|12|And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.
2 Samuel|5|13|And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
2 Samuel|5|14|And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
2 Samuel|5|15|and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
2 Samuel|5|16|and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2 Samuel|5|17|And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
2 Samuel|5|18|Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|19|And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
2 Samuel|5|20|And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
2 Samuel|5|21|And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
2 Samuel|5|22|And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|23|And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
2 Samuel|5|24|And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|5|25|And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
2 Samuel|6|1|And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2 Samuel|6|2|And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth {above} the cherubim.
2 Samuel|6|3|And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
2 Samuel|6|4|And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
2 Samuel|6|5|And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of {instruments made of} fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
2 Samuel|6|6|And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth {his hand} to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.
2 Samuel|6|7|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
2 Samuel|6|8|And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.
2 Samuel|6|9|And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?
2 Samuel|6|10|So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel|6|11|And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
2 Samuel|6|12|And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
2 Samuel|6|13|And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
2 Samuel|6|14|And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
2 Samuel|6|15|So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel|6|16|And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
2 Samuel|6|17|And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|18|And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
2 Samuel|6|19|And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion {of flesh}, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.
2 Samuel|6|20|Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
2 Samuel|6|21|And David said unto Michal, {It was} before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|22|And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.
2 Samuel|6|23|And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2 Samuel|7|1|And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
2 Samuel|7|2|that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
2 Samuel|7|3|And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.
2 Samuel|7|4|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,
2 Samuel|7|5|Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
2 Samuel|7|6|for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
2 Samuel|7|7|In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
2 Samuel|7|8|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;
2 Samuel|7|9|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
2 Samuel|7|10|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,
2 Samuel|7|11|and {as} from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.
2 Samuel|7|12|When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel|7|13|He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
2 Samuel|7|14|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;
2 Samuel|7|15|but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
2 Samuel|7|16|And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
2 Samuel|7|17|According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2 Samuel|7|18|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
2 Samuel|7|19|And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this {too} after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!
2 Samuel|7|20|And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.
2 Samuel|7|21|For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.
2 Samuel|7|22|Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
2 Samuel|7|23|And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, {from} the nations and their gods?
2 Samuel|7|24|And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
2 Samuel|7|25|And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
2 Samuel|7|26|And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.
2 Samuel|7|27|For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
2 Samuel|7|28|And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
2 Samuel|7|29|now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
2 Samuel|8|1|And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|8|2|And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
2 Samuel|8|3|David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
2 Samuel|8|4|And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
2 Samuel|8|5|And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|6|Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
2 Samuel|8|7|And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|8|8|And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2 Samuel|8|9|And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
2 Samuel|8|10|then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And {Joram} brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
2 Samuel|8|11|These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
2 Samuel|8|12|of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2 Samuel|8|13|And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|14|And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
2 Samuel|8|15|And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
2 Samuel|8|16|And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel|8|17|and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
2 Samuel|8|18|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was over} the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
2 Samuel|9|1|And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
2 Samuel|9|2|And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
2 Samuel|9|3|And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
2 Samuel|9|4|And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|5|Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|6|And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!
2 Samuel|9|7|And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
2 Samuel|9|8|And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2 Samuel|9|9|Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.
2 Samuel|9|10|And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in {the fruits}, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2 Samuel|9|11|Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, {said the king}, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|9|12|And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel|9|13|So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.
2 Samuel|10|1|And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2 Samuel|10|2|And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|3|But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
2 Samuel|10|4|So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
2 Samuel|10|5|When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
2 Samuel|10|6|And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
2 Samuel|10|7|And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
2 Samuel|10|8|And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
2 Samuel|10|9|Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
2 Samuel|10|10|And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|11|And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
2 Samuel|10|12|Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
2 Samuel|10|13|So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
2 Samuel|10|14|And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|10|15|And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2 Samuel|10|16|And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
2 Samuel|10|17|And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
2 Samuel|10|18|And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians {the men of} seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.
2 Samuel|10|19|And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
2 Samuel|11|1|And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out {to battle}, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|11|2|And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
2 Samuel|11|3|And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
2 Samuel|11|4|And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.
2 Samuel|11|5|And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
2 Samuel|11|6|And David sent to Joab, {saying}, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2 Samuel|11|7|And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
2 Samuel|11|8|And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess {of food} from the king.
2 Samuel|11|9|But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
2 Samuel|11|10|And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?
2 Samuel|11|11|And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
2 Samuel|11|12|And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
2 Samuel|11|13|And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
2 Samuel|11|14|And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel|11|15|And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
2 Samuel|11|16|And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.
2 Samuel|11|17|And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2 Samuel|11|18|Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel|11|19|and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,
2 Samuel|11|20|it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
2 Samuel|11|21|who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel|11|22|So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
2 Samuel|11|23|And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.
2 Samuel|11|24|And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel|11|25|Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
2 Samuel|11|26|And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
2 Samuel|11|27|And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.
2 Samuel|12|1|And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
2 Samuel|12|2|The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;
2 Samuel|12|3|but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
2 Samuel|12|4|And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
2 Samuel|12|5|And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:
2 Samuel|12|6|and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2 Samuel|12|7|And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
2 Samuel|12|8|and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.
2 Samuel|12|9|Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|12|10|Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
2 Samuel|12|11|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
2 Samuel|12|12|For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
2 Samuel|12|13|And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
2 Samuel|12|14|Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
2 Samuel|12|15|And Nathan departed unto his house.      And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
2 Samuel|12|16|David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
2 Samuel|12|17|And the elders of his house arose, {and stood} beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
2 Samuel|12|18|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!
2 Samuel|12|19|But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
2 Samuel|12|20|Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
2 Samuel|12|21|Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
2 Samuel|12|22|And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?
2 Samuel|12|23|But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
2 Samuel|12|24|And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;
2 Samuel|12|25|and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.
2 Samuel|12|26|Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
2 Samuel|12|27|And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.
2 Samuel|12|28|Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2 Samuel|12|29|And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
2 Samuel|12|30|And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and {in it were} precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
2 Samuel|12|31|And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|13|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2 Samuel|13|2|And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.
2 Samuel|13|3|But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
2 Samuel|13|4|And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
2 Samuel|13|5|And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
2 Samuel|13|6|So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
2 Samuel|13|7|Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.
2 Samuel|13|8|So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
2 Samuel|13|9|And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
2 Samuel|13|10|And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
2 Samuel|13|11|And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
2 Samuel|13|12|And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
2 Samuel|13|13|And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
2 Samuel|13|14|Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
2 Samuel|13|15|Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
2 Samuel|13|16|And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is {worse} than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
2 Samuel|13|17|Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|18|And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|19|And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
2 Samuel|13|20|And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
2 Samuel|13|21|But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
2 Samuel|13|22|And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel|13|23|And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|13|24|And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
2 Samuel|13|25|And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
2 Samuel|13|26|Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
2 Samuel|13|27|But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2 Samuel|13|28|And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
2 Samuel|13|29|And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
2 Samuel|13|30|And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.
2 Samuel|13|31|Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
2 Samuel|13|32|And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel|13|33|Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
2 Samuel|13|34|But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.
2 Samuel|13|35|And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.
2 Samuel|13|36|And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
2 Samuel|13|37|But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And {David} mourned for his son every day.
2 Samuel|13|38|So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2 Samuel|13|39|And {the soul of} king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
2 Samuel|14|1|Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel|14|2|And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:
2 Samuel|14|3|and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2 Samuel|14|4|And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
2 Samuel|14|5|And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
2 Samuel|14|6|And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.
2 Samuel|14|7|And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.
2 Samuel|14|8|And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
2 Samuel|14|9|And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
2 Samuel|14|10|And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
2 Samuel|14|11|Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
2 Samuel|14|12|Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
2 Samuel|14|13|And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.
2 Samuel|14|14|For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.
2 Samuel|14|15|Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|16|For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
2 Samuel|14|17|Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.
2 Samuel|14|18|Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
2 Samuel|14|19|And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;
2 Samuel|14|20|to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
2 Samuel|14|21|And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
2 Samuel|14|22|And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|23|So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|14|24|And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.
2 Samuel|14|25|Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel|14|26|And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.
2 Samuel|14|27|And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
2 Samuel|14|28|And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king’s face.
2 Samuel|14|29|Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
2 Samuel|14|30|Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2 Samuel|14|31|Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
2 Samuel|14|32|And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.
2 Samuel|14|33|So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2 Samuel|15|2|And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
2 Samuel|15|3|And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
2 Samuel|15|4|Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
2 Samuel|15|5|And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
2 Samuel|15|6|And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel|15|7|And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|8|For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.
2 Samuel|15|9|And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|10|But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|11|And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.
2 Samuel|15|12|And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|13|And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|14|And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
2 Samuel|15|15|And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.
2 Samuel|15|16|And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.
2 Samuel|15|17|And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.
2 Samuel|15|18|And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2 Samuel|15|19|Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; {return} to thine own place.
2 Samuel|15|20|Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
2 Samuel|15|21|And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.
2 Samuel|15|22|And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
2 Samuel|15|23|And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
2 Samuel|15|24|And, lo, Zadok also {came}, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
2 Samuel|15|25|And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
2 Samuel|15|26|but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
2 Samuel|15|27|The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou {not} a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
2 Samuel|15|28|See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
2 Samuel|15|29|Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.
2 Samuel|15|30|And David went up by the ascent of the {mount of} Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2 Samuel|15|31|And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
2 Samuel|15|32|And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top {of the ascent}, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
2 Samuel|15|33|And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:
2 Samuel|15|34|but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
2 Samuel|15|35|And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
2 Samuel|15|36|Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.
2 Samuel|15|37|So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|16|1|And when David was a little past the top {of the ascent}, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
2 Samuel|16|2|And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
2 Samuel|16|3|And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
2 Samuel|16|4|Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, O king.
2 Samuel|16|5|And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.
2 Samuel|16|6|And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2 Samuel|16|7|And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:
2 Samuel|16|8|Jehovah hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and Jehovah hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art {taken} in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.
2 Samuel|16|9|Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
2 Samuel|16|10|And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
2 Samuel|16|11|And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more {may} this Benjamite now {do it}? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.
2 Samuel|16|12|It may be that Jehovah will look on the wrong done unto me, and that Jehovah will requite me good for {his} cursing of me this day.
2 Samuel|16|13|So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
2 Samuel|16|14|And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
2 Samuel|16|15|And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
2 Samuel|16|16|And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, {Long} live the king, {Long} live the king.
2 Samuel|16|17|And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
2 Samuel|16|18|And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
2 Samuel|16|19|And again, whom should I serve? {should I} not {serve} in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.
2 Samuel|16|20|Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.
2 Samuel|16|21|And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
2 Samuel|16|22|So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel|16|23|And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
2 Samuel|17|1|Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
2 Samuel|17|2|and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
2 Samuel|17|3|and I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: {so} all the people shall be in peace.
2 Samuel|17|4|And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel|17|5|Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
2 Samuel|17|6|And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do {after} his saying? if not, speak thou.
2 Samuel|17|7|And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.
2 Samuel|17|8|Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
2 Samuel|17|9|Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some {other} place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
2 Samuel|17|10|And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.
2 Samuel|17|11|But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
2 Samuel|17|12|So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.
2 Samuel|17|13|Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
2 Samuel|17|14|And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom.
2 Samuel|17|15|Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
2 Samuel|17|16|Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
2 Samuel|17|17|Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.
2 Samuel|17|18|But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.
2 Samuel|17|19|And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
2 Samuel|17|20|And Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|17|21|And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
2 Samuel|17|22|Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|17|23|And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
2 Samuel|17|24|Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
2 Samuel|17|25|And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
2 Samuel|17|26|And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel|17|27|And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
2 Samuel|17|28|brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched {grain}, and beans, and lentils, and parched {pulse},
2 Samuel|17|29|and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
2 Samuel|18|1|And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
2 Samuel|18|2|And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
2 Samuel|18|3|But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.
2 Samuel|18|4|And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
2 Samuel|18|5|And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
2 Samuel|18|6|So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel|18|7|And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.
2 Samuel|18|8|For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2 Samuel|18|9|And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.
2 Samuel|18|10|And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
2 Samuel|18|11|And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten {pieces of} silver, and a girdle.
2 Samuel|18|12|And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand {pieces of} silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
2 Samuel|18|13|Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hid from the king), then thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against {me}.
2 Samuel|18|14|Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
2 Samuel|18|15|And ten young men that bare Joab’s armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
2 Samuel|18|16|And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
2 Samuel|18|17|And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
2 Samuel|18|18|Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument, unto this day.
2 Samuel|18|19|Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.
2 Samuel|18|20|And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
2 Samuel|18|21|Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
2 Samuel|18|22|Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?
2 Samuel|18|23|But come what may, {said he}, I will run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
2 Samuel|18|24|Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
2 Samuel|18|25|And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
2 Samuel|18|26|And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold, {another} man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
2 Samuel|18|27|And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
2 Samuel|18|28|And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
2 Samuel|18|29|And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
2 Samuel|18|30|And the king said, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
2 Samuel|18|31|And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
2 Samuel|18|32|And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
2 Samuel|18|33|And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2 Samuel|19|1|And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
2 Samuel|19|2|And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.
2 Samuel|19|3|And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
2 Samuel|19|4|And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2 Samuel|19|5|And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
2 Samuel|19|6|in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
2 Samuel|19|7|Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
2 Samuel|19|8|Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the king.      Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2 Samuel|19|9|And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
2 Samuel|19|10|And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
2 Samuel|19|11|And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, {to bring him} to his house.
2 Samuel|19|12|Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
2 Samuel|19|13|And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
2 Samuel|19|14|And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as {the heart of} one man; so that they sent unto the king, {saying}, Return thou, and all thy servants.
2 Samuel|19|15|So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|16|And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
2 Samuel|19|17|And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.
2 Samuel|19|18|And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|19|And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
2 Samuel|19|20|For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
2 Samuel|19|21|But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed?
2 Samuel|19|22|And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
2 Samuel|19|23|And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
2 Samuel|19|24|And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
2 Samuel|19|25|And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
2 Samuel|19|26|And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.
2 Samuel|19|27|And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
2 Samuel|19|28|For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?
2 Samuel|19|29|And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
2 Samuel|19|30|And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.
2 Samuel|19|31|And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|32|Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
2 Samuel|19|33|And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|19|34|And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
2 Samuel|19|35|I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2 Samuel|19|36|Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2 Samuel|19|37|Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
2 Samuel|19|38|And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
2 Samuel|19|39|And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
2 Samuel|19|40|So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|19|41|And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?
2 Samuel|19|42|And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?
2 Samuel|19|43|And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more {right} in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel|20|1|And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
2 Samuel|20|2|So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|20|3|And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2 Samuel|20|4|Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.
2 Samuel|20|5|So Amasa went to call {the men of} Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2 Samuel|20|6|And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.
2 Samuel|20|7|And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|8|When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
2 Samuel|20|9|And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
2 Samuel|20|10|But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.      And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|11|And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.
2 Samuel|20|12|And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
2 Samuel|20|13|When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|14|And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
2 Samuel|20|15|And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
2 Samuel|20|16|Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
2 Samuel|20|17|And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
2 Samuel|20|18|Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask {counsel} at Abel: and so they ended {the matter}.
2 Samuel|20|19|I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|20|20|And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
2 Samuel|20|21|The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
2 Samuel|20|22|Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
2 Samuel|20|23|Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
2 Samuel|20|24|and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
2 Samuel|20|25|and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
2 Samuel|20|26|and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David.
2 Samuel|21|1|And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
2 Samuel|21|2|And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);
2 Samuel|21|3|and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|21|4|And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
2 Samuel|21|5|And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, {that} we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
2 Samuel|21|6|let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.
2 Samuel|21|7|But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
2 Samuel|21|8|But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
2 Samuel|21|9|And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell {all} seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
2 Samuel|21|10|And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
2 Samuel|21|11|And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
2 Samuel|21|12|And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;
2 Samuel|21|13|and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
2 Samuel|21|14|And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
2 Samuel|21|15|And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;
2 Samuel|21|16|and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred {shekels} of brass in weight, he being girded with a new {sword}, thought to have slain David.
2 Samuel|21|17|But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.
2 Samuel|21|18|And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
2 Samuel|21|19|And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
2 Samuel|21|20|And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
2 Samuel|21|21|And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.
2 Samuel|21|22|These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2 Samuel|22|1|And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
2 Samuel|22|2|and he said,             Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;
2 Samuel|22|3|God, my rock, in him will I take refuge;                   My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;                   My saviour, thou savest me from violence.
2 Samuel|22|4|I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:                   So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
2 Samuel|22|5|For the waves of death compassed me;                   The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:
2 Samuel|22|6|The cords of Sheol were round about me;                   The snares of death came upon me.
2 Samuel|22|7|In my distress I called upon Jehovah;                   Yea, I called unto my God:                   And he heard my voice out of his temple,                   And my cry {came} into his ears.
2 Samuel|22|8|Then the earth shook and trembled,                   The foundations of heaven quaked                   And were shaken, because he was wroth.
2 Samuel|22|9|There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,                   And fire out of his mouth devoured:                   Coals were kindled by it.
2 Samuel|22|10|He bowed the heavens also, and came down;                   And thick darkness was under his feet.
2 Samuel|22|11|And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;                   Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2 Samuel|22|12|And he made darkness pavilions round about him,                   Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
2 Samuel|22|13|At the brightness before him                   Coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel|22|14|Jehovah thundered from heaven,                   And the Most High uttered his voice.
2 Samuel|22|15|And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;                   Lightning, and discomfited them.
2 Samuel|22|16|Then the channels of the sea appeared,                   The foundations of the world were laid bare,                   By the rebuke of Jehovah,                   At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
2 Samuel|22|17|He sent from on high, he took me;                   He drew me out of many waters;
2 Samuel|22|18|He delivered me from my strong enemy,                   From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
2 Samuel|22|19|They came upon me in the day of my calamity;                   But Jehovah was my stay.
2 Samuel|22|20|He brought me forth also into a large place;                   He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2 Samuel|22|21|Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness;                   According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
2 Samuel|22|22|For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,                   And have not wickedly departed from my God.
2 Samuel|22|23|For all his ordinances were before me;                   And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
2 Samuel|22|24|I was also perfect toward him;                   And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
2 Samuel|22|25|Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,                   According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
2 Samuel|22|26|With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful;                   With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
2 Samuel|22|27|With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;                   And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
2 Samuel|22|28|And the afflicted people thou wilt save;                   But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
2 Samuel|22|29|For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah;                   And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.
2 Samuel|22|30|For by thee I run upon a troop;                   By my God do I leap over a wall.
2 Samuel|22|31|As for God, his way is perfect:                   The word of Jehovah is tried;                   He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.
2 Samuel|22|32|For who is God, save Jehovah?                   And who is a rock, save our God?
2 Samuel|22|33|God is my strong fortress;                   And he guideth the perfect in his way.
2 Samuel|22|34|He maketh his feet like hinds’ {feet},                   And setteth me upon my high places.
2 Samuel|22|35|He teacheth my hands to war,                   So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
2 Samuel|22|36|Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation;                   And thy gentleness hath made me great.
2 Samuel|22|37|Thou hast enlarged my steps under me;                   And my feet have not slipped.
2 Samuel|22|38|I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;                   Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
2 Samuel|22|39|And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise:                   Yea, they are fallen under my feet.
2 Samuel|22|40|For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;                   Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
2 Samuel|22|41|Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,                   That I might cut off them that hate me.
2 Samuel|22|42|They looked, but there was none to save;                   Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.
2 Samuel|22|43|Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,                   I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.
2 Samuel|22|44|Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people;                   Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations:                   A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
2 Samuel|22|45|The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me:                   As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.
2 Samuel|22|46|The foreigners shall fade away,                   And shall come trembling out of their close places.
2 Samuel|22|47|Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock;                   And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
2 Samuel|22|48|Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,                   And that bringeth down peoples under me,
2 Samuel|22|49|And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:                   Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;                   Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
2 Samuel|22|50|Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,                   And will sing praises unto thy name.
2 Samuel|22|51|Great deliverance giveth he to his king,                   And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed,                   To David and to his seed, for evermore.
2 Samuel|23|1|Now these are the last words of David.             David the son of Jesse saith,                   And the man who was raised on high saith,                   The anointed of the God of Jacob,                   And the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2 Samuel|23|2|The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me,                   And his word was upon my tongue.
2 Samuel|23|3|The God of Israel said,                   The Rock of Israel spake to me:                   One that ruleth over men righteously,                   That ruleth in the fear of God,
2 Samuel|23|4|{He shall be} as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,                   A morning without clouds,                           {When} the tender grass {springeth} out of the earth,                   Through clear shining after rain.
2 Samuel|23|5|Verily my house is not so with God;                   Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant,                   Ordered in all things, and sure:                   For it is all my salvation, and all {my} desire,                   Although he maketh it not to grow.
2 Samuel|23|6|But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away,                   Because they cannot be taken with the hand;
2 Samuel|23|7|But the man that toucheth them                   Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear:                   And they shall be utterly burned with fire in {their} place.
2 Samuel|23|8|These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.
2 Samuel|23|9|And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.
2 Samuel|23|10|He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.
2 Samuel|23|11|And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel|23|12|But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory.
2 Samuel|23|13|And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|23|14|And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
2 Samuel|23|15|And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
2 Samuel|23|16|And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.
2 Samuel|23|17|And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: {shall I drink} the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
2 Samuel|23|18|And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.
2 Samuel|23|19|Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the {first} three.
2 Samuel|23|20|And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two {sons of} Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
2 Samuel|23|21|And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
2 Samuel|23|22|These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
2 Samuel|23|23|He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three. And David set him over his guard.
2 Samuel|23|24|Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
2 Samuel|23|25|Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
2 Samuel|23|26|Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
2 Samuel|23|27|Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2 Samuel|23|28|Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
2 Samuel|23|29|Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
2 Samuel|23|30|Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
2 Samuel|23|31|Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2 Samuel|23|32|Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
2 Samuel|23|33|Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
2 Samuel|23|34|Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2 Samuel|23|35|Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
2 Samuel|23|36|Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
2 Samuel|23|37|Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
2 Samuel|23|38|Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
2 Samuel|23|39|Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
2 Samuel|24|1|And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel|24|2|And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.
2 Samuel|24|3|And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
2 Samuel|24|4|Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|24|5|And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:
2 Samuel|24|6|then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,
2 Samuel|24|7|and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|24|8|So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2 Samuel|24|9|And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2 Samuel|24|10|And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
2 Samuel|24|11|And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
2 Samuel|24|12|Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
2 Samuel|24|13|So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
2 Samuel|24|14|And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
2 Samuel|24|15|So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
2 Samuel|24|16|And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|17|And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.
2 Samuel|24|18|And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|19|And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
2 Samuel|24|20|And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
2 Samuel|24|21|And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
2 Samuel|24|22|And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
2 Samuel|24|23|all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.
2 Samuel|24|24|And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
2 Samuel|24|25|And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
3 John|1|1|The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
3 John|1|2|Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 John|1|3|For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
3 John|1|4|Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
3 John|1|5|Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
3 John|1|6|who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
3 John|1|7|because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3 John|1|8|We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
3 John|1|9|I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
3 John|1|10|Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth {them} out of the church.
3 John|1|11|Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
3 John|1|12|Demetrius hath the witness of all {men}, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.
3 John|1|13|I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write {them} to thee with ink and pen:
3 John|1|14|but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace {be} unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
Hosea|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
Hosea|1|2|When Jehovah spake at the first by Hosea, Jehovah said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom; for the land doth commit great whoredom, {departing} from Jehovah.
Hosea|1|3|So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.
Hosea|1|4|And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
Hosea|1|5|And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
Hosea|1|6|And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And {Jehovah} said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.
Hosea|1|7|But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
Hosea|1|8|Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
Hosea|1|9|And {Jehovah} said, Call his name Lo-ammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your {God}.
Hosea|1|10|Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, {Ye are} the sons of the living God.
Hosea|1|11|And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up from the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
Hosea|2|1|Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Hosea|2|2|Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
Hosea|2|3|lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
Hosea|2|4|Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;
Hosea|2|5|for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
Hosea|2|6|Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.
Hosea|2|7|And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
Hosea|2|8|For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
Hosea|2|9|Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
Hosea|2|10|And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
Hosea|2|11|I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
Hosea|2|12|And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
Hosea|2|13|And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.
Hosea|2|14|Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
Hosea|2|15|And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
Hosea|2|16|And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.
Hosea|2|17|For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
Hosea|2|18|And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.
Hosea|2|19|And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
Hosea|2|20|I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.
Hosea|2|21|And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;
Hosea|2|22|and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
Hosea|2|23|And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them that were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, {Thou art} my God.
Hosea|3|1|And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of {her} friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.
Hosea|3|2|So I bought her to me for fifteen {pieces} of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
Hosea|3|3|and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife: so will I also be toward thee.
Hosea|3|4|For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:
Hosea|3|5|afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king, and shall come with fear unto Jehovah and to his goodness in the latter days.
Hosea|4|1|Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Hosea|4|2|There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
Hosea|4|3|Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
Hosea|4|4|Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
Hosea|4|5|And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
Hosea|4|6|My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
Hosea|4|7|As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
Hosea|4|8|They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
Hosea|4|9|And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.
Hosea|4|10|And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.
Hosea|4|11|Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
Hosea|4|12|My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, {departing} from under their God.
Hosea|4|13|They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.
Hosea|4|14|I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for {the men} themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.
Hosea|4|15|Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.
Hosea|4|16|For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea|4|17|Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
Hosea|4|18|Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.
Hosea|4|19|The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.
Hosea|5|1|Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
Hosea|5|2|And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.
Hosea|5|3|I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.
Hosea|5|4|Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.
Hosea|5|5|And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.
Hosea|5|6|They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea|5|7|They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.
Hosea|5|8|Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.
Hosea|5|9|Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea|5|10|The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea|5|11|Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after {man’s} command.
Hosea|5|12|Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
Hosea|5|13|When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah {saw} his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.
Hosea|5|14|For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.
Hosea|5|15|I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly.
Hosea|6|1|Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
Hosea|6|2|After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
Hosea|6|3|And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.
Hosea|6|4|O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.
Hosea|6|5|Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are {as} the light that goeth forth.
Hosea|6|6|For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
Hosea|6|7|But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea|6|8|Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
Hosea|6|9|And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.
Hosea|6|10|In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is {found} in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
Hosea|6|11|Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
Hosea|7|1|When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.
Hosea|7|2|And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.
Hosea|7|3|They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
Hosea|7|4|They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir {the fire}, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.
Hosea|7|5|On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.
Hosea|7|6|For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
Hosea|7|7|They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
Hosea|7|8|Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Hosea|7|9|Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth {it} not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth {it} not.
Hosea|7|10|And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.
Hosea|7|11|And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.
Hosea|7|12|When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
Hosea|7|13|Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
Hosea|7|14|And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.
Hosea|7|15|Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.
Hosea|7|16|They return, but not to {him that is} on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
Hosea|8|1|{Set} the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle {he cometh} against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
Hosea|8|2|They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.
Hosea|8|3|Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea|8|4|They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
Hosea|8|5|He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
Hosea|8|6|For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
Hosea|8|7|For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
Hosea|8|8|Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.
Hosea|8|9|For they are gone up to Assyria, {like} a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
Hosea|8|10|Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.
Hosea|8|11|Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.
Hosea|8|12|I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.
Hosea|8|13|As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
Hosea|8|14|For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fortified cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.
Hosea|9|1|Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, {departing} from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.
Hosea|9|2|The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.
Hosea|9|3|They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
Hosea|9|4|They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
Hosea|9|5|What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?
Hosea|9|6|For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; {yet} Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.
Hosea|9|7|The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.
Hosea|9|8|Ephraim {was} a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, {and} enmity in the house of his God.
Hosea|9|9|They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
Hosea|9|10|I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.
Hosea|9|11|As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.
Hosea|9|12|Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
Hosea|9|13|Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.
Hosea|9|14|Give them, O Jehovah-what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
Hosea|9|15|All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.
Hosea|9|16|Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.
Hosea|9|17|My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
Hosea|10|1|Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.
Hosea|10|2|Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.
Hosea|10|3|Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?
Hosea|10|4|They speak {vain} words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
Hosea|10|5|The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
Hosea|10|6|It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
Hosea|10|7|{As for} Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.
Hosea|10|8|The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
Hosea|10|9|O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.
Hosea|10|10|When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.
Hosea|10|11|And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out {the grain}; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.
Hosea|10|12|Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
Hosea|10|13|Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
Hosea|10|14|Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
Hosea|10|15|So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
Hosea|11|1|When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
Hosea|11|2|The more {the prophets} called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
Hosea|11|3|Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
Hosea|11|4|I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.
Hosea|11|5|They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return {to me}.
Hosea|11|6|And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour {them}, because of their own counsels.
Hosea|11|7|And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to {him that is} on high, none at all will exalt {him}.
Hosea|11|8|How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? {how} shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? {how} shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.
Hosea|11|9|I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.
Hosea|11|10|They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
Hosea|11|11|They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.
Hosea|11|12|Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
Hosea|12|1|Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
Hosea|12|2|Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
Hosea|12|3|In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:
Hosea|12|4|yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us,
Hosea|12|5|even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial {name}.
Hosea|12|6|Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.
Hosea|12|7|{He is} a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
Hosea|12|8|And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.
Hosea|12|9|But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.
Hosea|12|10|I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.
Hosea|12|11|Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
Hosea|12|12|And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept {sheep}.
Hosea|12|13|And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
Hosea|12|14|Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
Hosea|13|1|When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
Hosea|13|2|And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
Hosea|13|3|Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
Hosea|13|4|Yet I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt know no god but me, and besides me there is no saviour.
Hosea|13|5|I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
Hosea|13|6|According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.
Hosea|13|7|Therefore am I unto them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way;
Hosea|13|8|I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them.
Hosea|13|9|It is thy destruction, O Israel, that {thou art} against me, against thy help.
Hosea|13|10|Where now is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
Hosea|13|11|I have given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.
Hosea|13|12|The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.
Hosea|13|13|The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children.
Hosea|13|14|I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O Sheol, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
Hosea|13|15|Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.
Hosea|13|16|Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
Hosea|14|1|O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
Hosea|14|2|Take with you words, and return unto Jehovah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render {as} bullocks {the offering of} our lips.
Hosea|14|3|Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, {Ye are} our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
Hosea|14|4|I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.
Hosea|14|5|I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
Hosea|14|6|His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
Hosea|14|7|They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive {as} the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea|14|8|Ephraim {shall say}, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.
Hosea|14|9|Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
Jeremiah|1|1|The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
Jeremiah|1|2|to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
Jeremiah|1|3|It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
Jeremiah|1|4|Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|1|5|Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.
Jeremiah|1|6|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.
Jeremiah|1|7|But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.
Jeremiah|1|8|Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|1|9|Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:
Jeremiah|1|10|see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
Jeremiah|1|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.
Jeremiah|1|12|Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.
Jeremiah|1|13|And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.
Jeremiah|1|14|Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
Jeremiah|1|15|For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah|1|16|And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
Jeremiah|1|17|Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.
Jeremiah|1|18|For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
Jeremiah|1|19|And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.
Jeremiah|2|1|And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Jeremiah|2|2|Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
Jeremiah|2|3|Israel {was} holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|4|Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
Jeremiah|2|5|thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
Jeremiah|2|6|Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt?
Jeremiah|2|7|And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
Jeremiah|2|8|The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
Jeremiah|2|9|Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children’s children will I contend.
Jeremiah|2|10|For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing.
Jeremiah|2|11|Hath a nation changed {its} gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
Jeremiah|2|12|Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|13|For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
Jeremiah|2|14|Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born {slave}? why is he become a prey?
Jeremiah|2|15|The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|2|16|The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.
Jeremiah|2|17|Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, when he led thee by the way?
Jeremiah|2|18|And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
Jeremiah|2|19|Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|2|20|For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds; and thou saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself, playing the harlot.
Jeremiah|2|21|Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me?
Jeremiah|2|22|For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|23|How canst thou say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: {thou art} a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
Jeremiah|2|24|a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
Jeremiah|2|25|Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
Jeremiah|2|26|As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;
Jeremiah|2|27|who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
Jeremiah|2|28|But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
Jeremiah|2|29|Wherefore will ye contend with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|30|In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
Jeremiah|2|31|O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more unto thee?
Jeremiah|2|32|Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
Jeremiah|2|33|How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways.
Jeremiah|2|34|Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.
Jeremiah|2|35|Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
Jeremiah|2|36|Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
Jeremiah|2|37|From thence also shalt thou go forth, with thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah hath rejected those in whom thou trustest, and thou shalt not prosper with them.
Jeremiah|3|1|They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|2|Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
Jeremiah|3|3|Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hast a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
Jeremiah|3|4|Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?
Jeremiah|3|5|Will he retain {his anger} for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.
Jeremiah|3|6|Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
Jeremiah|3|7|And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
Jeremiah|3|8|And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.
Jeremiah|3|9|And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
Jeremiah|3|10|And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
Jeremiah|3|12|Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah, I will not keep {anger} for ever.
Jeremiah|3|13|Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|14|Return, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
Jeremiah|3|15|and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
Jeremiah|3|16|And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.
Jeremiah|3|17|At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
Jeremiah|3|18|In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers.
Jeremiah|3|19|But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.
Jeremiah|3|20|Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|21|A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping {and} the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.
Jeremiah|3|22|Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|3|23|Truly in vain is {the help that is looked for} from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
Jeremiah|3|24|But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
Jeremiah|3|25|Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|4|1|If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed;
Jeremiah|4|2|and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
Jeremiah|4|3|For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
Jeremiah|4|4|Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah|4|5|Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
Jeremiah|4|6|Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
Jeremiah|4|7|A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|4|8|For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.
Jeremiah|4|9|And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
Jeremiah|4|10|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life.
Jeremiah|4|11|At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
Jeremiah|4|12|a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.
Jeremiah|4|13|Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots {shall be} as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined.
Jeremiah|4|14|O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?
Jeremiah|4|15|For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim:
Jeremiah|4|16|make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, {that} watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah|4|17|As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|4|18|Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart.
Jeremiah|4|19|My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
Jeremiah|4|20|Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, {and} my curtains in a moment.
Jeremiah|4|21|How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
Jeremiah|4|22|For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
Jeremiah|4|23|I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
Jeremiah|4|24|I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.
Jeremiah|4|25|I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
Jeremiah|4|26|I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, {and} before his fierce anger.
Jeremiah|4|27|For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.
Jeremiah|4|28|For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
Jeremiah|4|29|Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.
Jeremiah|4|30|And thou, when thou art made desolate, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlargest thine eyes with paint, in vain dost thou make thyself fair; {thy} lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.
Jeremiah|4|31|For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that gaspeth for breath, that spreadeth her hands, {saying}, Woe is me now! for my soul fainteth before the murderers.
Jeremiah|5|1|Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her.
Jeremiah|5|2|And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely.
Jeremiah|5|3|O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? thou hast stricken them, but they were not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
Jeremiah|5|4|Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God:
Jeremiah|5|5|I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
Jeremiah|5|6|Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, {and} their backslidings are increased.
Jeremiah|5|7|How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots’ houses.
Jeremiah|5|8|They were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbor’s wife.
Jeremiah|5|9|Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|5|10|Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovah’s.
Jeremiah|5|11|For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|5|12|They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
Jeremiah|5|13|and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
Jeremiah|5|14|Wherefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
Jeremiah|5|15|Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
Jeremiah|5|16|Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
Jeremiah|5|17|And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, {which} thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustest, with the sword.
Jeremiah|5|18|But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
Jeremiah|5|19|And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
Jeremiah|5|20|Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|5|21|Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not:
Jeremiah|5|22|Fear ye not me? saith Jehovah: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.
Jeremiah|5|23|But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
Jeremiah|5|24|Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
Jeremiah|5|25|Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you.
Jeremiah|5|26|For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
Jeremiah|5|27|As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich.
Jeremiah|5|28|They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
Jeremiah|5|29|Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|5|30|A wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land:
Jeremiah|5|31|the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?
Jeremiah|6|1|Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.
Jeremiah|6|2|The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
Jeremiah|6|3|Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
Jeremiah|6|4|Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
Jeremiah|6|5|Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
Jeremiah|6|6|For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
Jeremiah|6|7|As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.
Jeremiah|6|8|Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
Jeremiah|6|9|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.
Jeremiah|6|10|To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
Jeremiah|6|11|Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
Jeremiah|6|12|And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|6|13|For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
Jeremiah|6|14|They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Jeremiah|6|15|Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|6|16|Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk {therein}.
Jeremiah|6|17|And I set watchmen over you, {saying}, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.
Jeremiah|6|18|Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
Jeremiah|6|19|Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
Jeremiah|6|20|To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.
Jeremiah|6|21|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
Jeremiah|6|22|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Jeremiah|6|23|They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.
Jeremiah|6|24|We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, {and} pangs as of a woman in travail.
Jeremiah|6|25|Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, {and} terror, are on every side.
Jeremiah|6|26|O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
Jeremiah|6|27|I have made thee a trier {and} a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.
Jeremiah|6|28|They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.
Jeremiah|6|29|The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.
Jeremiah|6|30|Refuse silver shall men call them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.
Jeremiah|7|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|7|2|Stand in the gate of Jehovah’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.
Jeremiah|7|3|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
Jeremiah|7|4|Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.
Jeremiah|7|5|For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
Jeremiah|7|6|if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:
Jeremiah|7|7|then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.
Jeremiah|7|8|Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
Jeremiah|7|9|Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,
Jeremiah|7|10|and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?
Jeremiah|7|11|Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|7|12|But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
Jeremiah|7|13|And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:
Jeremiah|7|14|therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
Jeremiah|7|15|And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
Jeremiah|7|16|Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.
Jeremiah|7|17|Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah|7|18|The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah|7|19|Do they provoke me to anger? saith Jehovah; {do they} not {provoke} themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
Jeremiah|7|20|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
Jeremiah|7|21|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.
Jeremiah|7|22|For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:
Jeremiah|7|23|but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
Jeremiah|7|24|But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in {their own} counsels {and} in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
Jeremiah|7|25|Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
Jeremiah|7|26|yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.
Jeremiah|7|27|And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
Jeremiah|7|28|And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
Jeremiah|7|29|Cut off thy hair, {O Jerusalem}, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
Jeremiah|7|30|For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah|7|31|And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.
Jeremiah|7|32|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place {to bury}.
Jeremiah|7|33|And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
Jeremiah|7|34|Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.
Jeremiah|8|1|At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
Jeremiah|8|2|and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
Jeremiah|8|3|And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|8|4|Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?
Jeremiah|8|5|Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
Jeremiah|8|6|I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.
Jeremiah|8|7|Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|8|How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.
Jeremiah|8|9|The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them?
Jeremiah|8|10|Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
Jeremiah|8|11|And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Jeremiah|8|12|Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|13|I will utterly consume them, saith Jehovah: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and {the things that} I have given them shall pass away from them.
Jeremiah|8|14|Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|15|We looked for peace, but no good came; {and} for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
Jeremiah|8|16|The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein.
Jeremiah|8|17|For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|18|Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.
Jeremiah|8|19|Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?
Jeremiah|8|20|The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
Jeremiah|8|21|For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay hath taken hold on me.
Jeremiah|8|22|Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
Jeremiah|9|1|Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
Jeremiah|9|2|Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
Jeremiah|9|3|And they bend their tongue, {as it were} their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|4|Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
Jeremiah|9|5|And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
Jeremiah|9|6|Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|7|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how {else} should I do, because of the daughter of my people?
Jeremiah|9|8|Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.
Jeremiah|9|9|Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|9|10|For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone.
Jeremiah|9|11|And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|9|12|Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and {who is} he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?
Jeremiah|9|13|And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,
Jeremiah|9|14|but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;
Jeremiah|9|15|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
Jeremiah|9|16|I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
Jeremiah|9|17|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come:
Jeremiah|9|18|and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
Jeremiah|9|19|For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.
Jeremiah|9|20|Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.
Jeremiah|9|21|For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from without, {and} the young men from the streets.
Jeremiah|9|22|Speak, Thus saith Jehovah, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman; and none shall gather {them}.
Jeremiah|9|23|Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches;
Jeremiah|9|24|but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|25|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in {their} uncircumcision:
Jeremiah|9|26|Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners {of their hair} cut off, that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.
Jeremiah|10|1|Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
Jeremiah|10|2|thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.
Jeremiah|10|3|For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
Jeremiah|10|4|They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
Jeremiah|10|5|They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.
Jeremiah|10|6|There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
Jeremiah|10|7|Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.
Jeremiah|10|8|But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.
Jeremiah|10|9|There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.
Jeremiah|10|10|But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
Jeremiah|10|11|Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
Jeremiah|10|12|He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:
Jeremiah|10|13|when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
Jeremiah|10|14|Every man is become brutish {and is} without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
Jeremiah|10|15|They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
Jeremiah|10|16|The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
Jeremiah|10|17|Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.
Jeremiah|10|18|For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel {it}.
Jeremiah|10|19|Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is {my} grief, and I must bear it.
Jeremiah|10|20|My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
Jeremiah|10|21|For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
Jeremiah|10|22|The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.
Jeremiah|10|23|O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
Jeremiah|10|24|O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
Jeremiah|10|25|Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
Jeremiah|11|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|11|2|Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|11|3|and say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant,
Jeremiah|11|4|which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;
Jeremiah|11|5|that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.
Jeremiah|11|6|And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
Jeremiah|11|7|For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
Jeremiah|11|8|Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
Jeremiah|11|9|And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|11|10|They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
Jeremiah|11|11|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.
Jeremiah|11|12|Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah|11|13|For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
Jeremiah|11|14|Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.
Jeremiah|11|15|What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness {with} many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
Jeremiah|11|16|Jehovah called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
Jeremiah|11|17|For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.
Jeremiah|11|18|And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings.
Jeremiah|11|19|But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, {saying}, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
Jeremiah|11|20|But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Jeremiah|11|21|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;
Jeremiah|11|22|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
Jeremiah|11|23|and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
Jeremiah|12|1|Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?
Jeremiah|12|2|Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
Jeremiah|12|3|But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
Jeremiah|12|4|How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
Jeremiah|12|5|If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?
Jeremiah|12|6|For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
Jeremiah|12|7|I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
Jeremiah|12|8|My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.
Jeremiah|12|9|Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
Jeremiah|12|10|Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah|12|11|They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
Jeremiah|12|12|Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.
Jeremiah|12|13|They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|12|14|Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah|12|15|And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
Jeremiah|12|16|And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.
Jeremiah|12|17|But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|13|1|Thus saith Jehovah unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
Jeremiah|13|2|So I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.
Jeremiah|13|3|And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,
Jeremiah|13|4|Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
Jeremiah|13|5|So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
Jeremiah|13|6|And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
Jeremiah|13|7|Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|8|Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|13|9|Thus saith Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|13|10|This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|11|For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
Jeremiah|13|12|Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
Jeremiah|13|13|Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
Jeremiah|13|14|And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
Jeremiah|13|15|Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken.
Jeremiah|13|16|Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
Jeremiah|13|17|But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for {your} pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.
Jeremiah|13|18|Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.
Jeremiah|13|19|The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.
Jeremiah|13|20|Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
Jeremiah|13|21|What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?
Jeremiah|13|22|And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.
Jeremiah|13|23|Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
Jeremiah|13|24|Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.
Jeremiah|13|25|This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
Jeremiah|13|26|Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.
Jeremiah|13|27|I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
Jeremiah|14|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
Jeremiah|14|2|Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
Jeremiah|14|3|And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|4|Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|5|Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh {her young}, because there is no grass.
Jeremiah|14|6|And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
Jeremiah|14|7|Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|8|O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
Jeremiah|14|9|Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
Jeremiah|14|10|Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
Jeremiah|14|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for {their} good.
Jeremiah|14|12|When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Jeremiah|14|13|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
Jeremiah|14|14|Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.
Jeremiah|14|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
Jeremiah|14|16|And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
Jeremiah|14|17|And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
Jeremiah|14|18|If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
Jeremiah|14|19|Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
Jeremiah|14|20|We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|21|Do not abhor {us}, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
Jeremiah|14|22|Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.
Jeremiah|15|1|Then said Jehovah unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
Jeremiah|15|2|And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
Jeremiah|15|3|And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
Jeremiah|15|4|And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|15|5|For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?
Jeremiah|15|6|Thou hast rejected me, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.
Jeremiah|15|7|And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved {them} of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.
Jeremiah|15|8|Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
Jeremiah|15|9|She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|10|Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; {yet} every one of them doth curse me.
Jeremiah|15|11|Jehovah said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
Jeremiah|15|12|Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
Jeremiah|15|13|Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
Jeremiah|15|14|And I will make {them} to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
Jeremiah|15|15|O Jehovah, thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
Jeremiah|15|16|Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.
Jeremiah|15|17|I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.
Jeremiah|15|18|Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful {brook}, as waters that fail?
Jeremiah|15|19|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.
Jeremiah|15|20|And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|21|And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
Jeremiah|16|1|The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|16|2|Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place.
Jeremiah|16|3|For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:
Jeremiah|16|4|They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|16|5|For thus saith Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.
Jeremiah|16|6|Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
Jeremiah|16|7|neither shall men break {bread} for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
Jeremiah|16|8|And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
Jeremiah|16|9|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
Jeremiah|16|10|And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah our God?
Jeremiah|16|11|Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
Jeremiah|16|12|and ye have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto me:
Jeremiah|16|13|therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.
Jeremiah|16|14|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah|16|15|but, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.
Jeremiah|16|16|Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
Jeremiah|16|17|For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.
Jeremiah|16|18|And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.
Jeremiah|16|19|O Jehovah, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nought but lies, {even} vanity and things wherein there is no profit.
Jeremiah|16|20|Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods?
Jeremiah|16|21|Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.
Jeremiah|17|1|The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, {and} with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
Jeremiah|17|2|whilst their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees upon the high hills.
Jeremiah|17|3|O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil, {and} thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.
Jeremiah|17|4|And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.
Jeremiah|17|5|Thus saith Jehovah: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from Jehovah.
Jeremiah|17|6|For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
Jeremiah|17|7|Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, and whose trust Jehovah is.
Jeremiah|17|8|For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat cometh, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
Jeremiah|17|9|The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?
Jeremiah|17|10|I, Jehovah, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
Jeremiah|17|11|As the partridge that sitteth on {eggs} which she hath not laid, so is he that getteth riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.
Jeremiah|17|12|A glorious throne, {set} on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
Jeremiah|17|13|O Jehovah, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be put to shame. They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.
Jeremiah|17|14|Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.
Jeremiah|17|15|Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now.
Jeremiah|17|16|As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.
Jeremiah|17|17|Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.
Jeremiah|17|18|Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
Jeremiah|17|19|Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|17|20|and say unto them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:
Jeremiah|17|21|Thus saith Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|17|22|neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
Jeremiah|17|23|But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.
Jeremiah|17|24|And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
Jeremiah|17|25|then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.
Jeremiah|17|26|And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing {sacrifices of} thanksgiving, unto the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|17|27|But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
Jeremiah|18|1|The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|18|2|Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
Jeremiah|18|3|Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels.
Jeremiah|18|4|And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
Jeremiah|18|5|Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Jeremiah|18|6|O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah|18|7|At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;
Jeremiah|18|8|if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
Jeremiah|18|9|And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
Jeremiah|18|10|if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
Jeremiah|18|11|Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
Jeremiah|18|12|But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.
Jeremiah|18|13|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.
Jeremiah|18|14|Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? {or} shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
Jeremiah|18|15|For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false {gods}; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;
Jeremiah|18|16|to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.
Jeremiah|18|17|I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
Jeremiah|18|18|Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
Jeremiah|18|19|Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
Jeremiah|18|20|Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.
Jeremiah|18|21|Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, {and} their young men smitten of the sword in battle.
Jeremiah|18|22|Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
Jeremiah|18|23|Yet, Jehovah, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me; forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight; but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thou with them in the time of thine anger.
Jeremiah|19|1|Thus said Jehovah, Go, and buy a potter’s earthen bottle, and {take} of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
Jeremiah|19|2|and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee;
Jeremiah|19|3|and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
Jeremiah|19|4|Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
Jeremiah|19|5|and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:
Jeremiah|19|6|therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.
Jeremiah|19|7|And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|19|8|And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
Jeremiah|19|9|And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress them.
Jeremiah|19|10|Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
Jeremiah|19|11|and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.
Jeremiah|19|12|Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth:
Jeremiah|19|13|and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods.
Jeremiah|19|14|Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah’s house, and said to all the people:
Jeremiah|19|15|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.
Jeremiah|20|1|Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
Jeremiah|20|2|Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|20|3|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
Jeremiah|20|4|For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
Jeremiah|20|5|Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|20|6|And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.
Jeremiah|20|7|O Jehovah, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.
Jeremiah|20|8|For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.
Jeremiah|20|9|And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot {contain}.
Jeremiah|20|10|For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, {say} all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
Jeremiah|20|11|But Jehovah is with me as a mighty one {and} a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.
Jeremiah|20|12|But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Jeremiah|20|13|Sing unto Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
Jeremiah|20|14|Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
Jeremiah|20|15|Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
Jeremiah|20|16|And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;
Jeremiah|20|17|because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
Jeremiah|20|18|Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
Jeremiah|21|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
Jeremiah|21|2|Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us: peradventure Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
Jeremiah|21|3|Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
Jeremiah|21|4|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans that besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
Jeremiah|21|5|And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.
Jeremiah|21|6|And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
Jeremiah|21|7|And afterward, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
Jeremiah|21|8|And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Jeremiah|21|9|He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
Jeremiah|21|10|For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
Jeremiah|21|11|And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Jeremiah|21|12|O house of David, thus saith Jehovah, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah|21|13|Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, {and} of the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
Jeremiah|21|14|And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.
Jeremiah|22|1|Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
Jeremiah|22|2|And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.
Jeremiah|22|3|Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah|22|4|For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
Jeremiah|22|5|But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.
Jeremiah|22|6|For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto me, {and} the head of Lebanon; {yet} surely I will make thee a wilderness, {and} cities which are not inhabited.
Jeremiah|22|7|And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
Jeremiah|22|8|And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?
Jeremiah|22|9|Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
Jeremiah|22|10|Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
Jeremiah|22|11|For thus saith Jehovah touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, {and} who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more.
Jeremiah|22|12|But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.
Jeremiah|22|13|Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor’s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;
Jeremiah|22|14|that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
Jeremiah|22|15|Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.
Jeremiah|22|16|He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|17|But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
Jeremiah|22|18|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, {saying}, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, {saying} Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
Jeremiah|22|19|He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|22|20|Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.
Jeremiah|22|21|I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
Jeremiah|22|22|The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
Jeremiah|22|23|O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
Jeremiah|22|24|As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
Jeremiah|22|25|and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|22|26|And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
Jeremiah|22|27|But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.
Jeremiah|22|28|Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?
Jeremiah|22|29|O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|30|Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.
Jeremiah|23|1|Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|2|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|3|And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah|23|4|And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|5|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah|23|6|In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
Jeremiah|23|7|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah|23|8|but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
Jeremiah|23|9|Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.
Jeremiah|23|10|For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;
Jeremiah|23|11|for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|12|Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|13|And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
Jeremiah|23|14|In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
Jeremiah|23|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
Jeremiah|23|16|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|17|They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.
Jeremiah|23|18|For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?
Jeremiah|23|19|Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, {even his} wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|23|20|The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.
Jeremiah|23|21|I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.
Jeremiah|23|22|But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah|23|23|Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah|23|24|Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|25|I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
Jeremiah|23|26|How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
Jeremiah|23|27|that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.
Jeremiah|23|28|The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|29|Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
Jeremiah|23|30|Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
Jeremiah|23|31|Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
Jeremiah|23|32|Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|33|And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|34|And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.
Jeremiah|23|35|Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|36|And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every man’s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.
Jeremiah|23|37|Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|38|But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
Jeremiah|23|39|therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:
Jeremiah|23|40|and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
Jeremiah|24|1|Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|24|2|One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
Jeremiah|24|3|Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|24|4|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|24|5|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
Jeremiah|24|6|For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah|24|7|And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah|24|8|And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah|24|9|I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
Jeremiah|24|10|And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
Jeremiah|25|1|The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,)
Jeremiah|25|2|which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
Jeremiah|25|3|From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
Jeremiah|25|4|And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,)
Jeremiah|25|5|saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;
Jeremiah|25|6|and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
Jeremiah|25|7|Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
Jeremiah|25|8|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,
Jeremiah|25|9|behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and {I will send} unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
Jeremiah|25|10|Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
Jeremiah|25|11|And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
Jeremiah|25|12|And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.
Jeremiah|25|13|And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
Jeremiah|25|14|For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
Jeremiah|25|15|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
Jeremiah|25|16|And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
Jeremiah|25|17|Then took I the cup at Jehovah’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me:
Jeremiah|25|18|{to wit}, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
Jeremiah|25|19|Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
Jeremiah|25|20|and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
Jeremiah|25|21|Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
Jeremiah|25|22|and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
Jeremiah|25|23|Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners {of their hair} cut off;
Jeremiah|25|24|and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness;
Jeremiah|25|25|and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
Jeremiah|25|26|and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
Jeremiah|25|27|And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
Jeremiah|25|28|And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.
Jeremiah|25|29|For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|25|30|Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread {the grapes}, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
Jeremiah|25|31|A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|25|32|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Jeremiah|25|33|And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
Jeremiah|25|34|Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow {in ashes}, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.
Jeremiah|25|35|And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
Jeremiah|25|36|A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.
Jeremiah|25|37|And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|25|38|He hath left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing {sword}, and because of his fierce anger.
Jeremiah|26|1|In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|26|2|Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah’s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovah’s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word.
Jeremiah|26|3|It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah|26|4|And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
Jeremiah|26|5|to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;
Jeremiah|26|6|then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
Jeremiah|26|7|And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|26|8|And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
Jeremiah|26|9|Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered unto Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|26|10|And when the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house unto the house of Jehovah; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s {house}.
Jeremiah|26|11|Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
Jeremiah|26|12|Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
Jeremiah|26|13|Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
Jeremiah|26|14|But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
Jeremiah|26|15|Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
Jeremiah|26|16|Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|26|17|Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
Jeremiah|26|18|Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
Jeremiah|26|19|Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
Jeremiah|26|20|And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
Jeremiah|26|21|and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty-men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:
Jeremiah|26|22|and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, {namely}, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;
Jeremiah|26|23|and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
Jeremiah|26|24|But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
Jeremiah|27|1|In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|27|2|Thus saith Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck;
Jeremiah|27|3|and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
Jeremiah|27|4|and give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters:
Jeremiah|27|5|I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.
Jeremiah|27|6|And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.
Jeremiah|27|7|And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.
Jeremiah|27|8|And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
Jeremiah|27|9|But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
Jeremiah|27|10|for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
Jeremiah|27|11|But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that {nation} will I let remain in their own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
Jeremiah|27|12|And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
Jeremiah|27|13|Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Jeremiah|27|14|And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
Jeremiah|27|15|For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
Jeremiah|27|16|Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
Jeremiah|27|17|Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?
Jeremiah|27|18|But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
Jeremiah|27|19|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
Jeremiah|27|20|which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|27|21|yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:
Jeremiah|27|22|They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith Jehovah; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.
Jeremiah|28|1|And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
Jeremiah|28|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|28|3|Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:
Jeremiah|28|4|and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|28|5|Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah,
Jeremiah|28|6|even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.
Jeremiah|28|7|Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:
Jeremiah|28|8|The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
Jeremiah|28|9|The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him.
Jeremiah|28|10|Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.
Jeremiah|28|11|And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Jeremiah|28|12|Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|28|13|Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.
Jeremiah|28|14|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may served Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
Jeremiah|28|15|Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
Jeremiah|28|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|28|17|So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
Jeremiah|29|1|Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
Jeremiah|29|2|(after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen-mother, and the eunuchs, {and} the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem,)
Jeremiah|29|3|by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying,
Jeremiah|29|4|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:
Jeremiah|29|5|Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
Jeremiah|29|6|Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.
Jeremiah|29|7|And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
Jeremiah|29|8|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
Jeremiah|29|9|For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|10|For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
Jeremiah|29|11|For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.
Jeremiah|29|12|And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
Jeremiah|29|13|And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
Jeremiah|29|14|And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places wither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
Jeremiah|29|15|Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
Jeremiah|29|16|thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
Jeremiah|29|17|thus saith Jehovah of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|29|18|And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them;
Jeremiah|29|19|because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|20|Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah|29|21|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
Jeremiah|29|22|and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
Jeremiah|29|23|because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|24|And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,
Jeremiah|29|25|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jeremiah|29|26|Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.
Jeremiah|29|27|Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,
Jeremiah|29|28|forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, {The captivity} is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
Jeremiah|29|29|And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah|29|30|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|29|31|Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;
Jeremiah|29|32|therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|30|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|30|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
Jeremiah|30|3|For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
Jeremiah|30|4|And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah|30|5|For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
Jeremiah|30|6|Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
Jeremiah|30|7|Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
Jeremiah|30|8|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;
Jeremiah|30|9|but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
Jeremiah|30|10|Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
Jeremiah|30|11|For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.
Jeremiah|30|12|For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.
Jeremiah|30|13|There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
Jeremiah|30|14|All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
Jeremiah|30|15|Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
Jeremiah|30|16|Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
Jeremiah|30|17|For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, {saying}, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
Jeremiah|30|18|Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
Jeremiah|30|19|And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
Jeremiah|30|20|Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.
Jeremiah|30|21|And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|30|22|And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Jeremiah|30|23|Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, {even his} wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|30|24|The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.
Jeremiah|31|1|At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
Jeremiah|31|2|Thus saith Jehovah, The people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
Jeremiah|31|3|Jehovah appeared of old unto me, {saying}, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
Jeremiah|31|4|Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
Jeremiah|31|5|Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy {the fruit thereof}.
Jeremiah|31|6|For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|31|7|For thus saith Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
Jeremiah|31|8|Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, {and} with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither.
Jeremiah|31|9|They shall come with weeping; and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
Jeremiah|31|10|Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd doth his flock.
Jeremiah|31|11|For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
Jeremiah|31|12|And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of Jehovah, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
Jeremiah|31|13|Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
Jeremiah|31|14|And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|15|Thus saith Jehovah: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
Jeremiah|31|16|Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
Jeremiah|31|17|And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah; and {thy} children shall come again to their own border.
Jeremiah|31|18|I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself {thus}, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed {to the yoke}: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.
Jeremiah|31|19|Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
Jeremiah|31|20|Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|21|Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
Jeremiah|31|22|How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.
Jeremiah|31|23|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.
Jeremiah|31|24|And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
Jeremiah|31|25|For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
Jeremiah|31|26|Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
Jeremiah|31|27|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
Jeremiah|31|28|And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|29|In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|30|But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|31|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Jeremiah|31|32|not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|33|But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
Jeremiah|31|34|and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
Jeremiah|31|35|Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:
Jeremiah|31|36|If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
Jeremiah|31|37|Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|38|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.
Jeremiah|31|39|And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.
Jeremiah|31|40|And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
Jeremiah|32|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
Jeremiah|32|2|Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.
Jeremiah|32|3|For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
Jeremiah|32|4|and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
Jeremiah|32|5|and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?
Jeremiah|32|6|And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|32|7|Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
Jeremiah|32|8|So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|32|9|And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah|32|10|And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
Jeremiah|32|11|So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, {according to} the law and custom, and that which was open:
Jeremiah|32|12|and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s {son}, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|32|13|And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
Jeremiah|32|14|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.
Jeremiah|32|15|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.
Jeremiah|32|16|Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|32|17|Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee,
Jeremiah|32|18|who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name;
Jeremiah|32|19|great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
Jeremiah|32|20|who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among {other} men; and madest thee a name, as at this day;
Jeremiah|32|21|and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
Jeremiah|32|22|and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
Jeremiah|32|23|and they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.
Jeremiah|32|24|Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
Jeremiah|32|25|And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|32|26|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|32|27|Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
Jeremiah|32|28|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
Jeremiah|32|29|and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah|32|30|For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|32|31|For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
Jeremiah|32|32|because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|32|33|And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
Jeremiah|32|34|But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah|32|35|And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through {the fire} unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah|32|36|And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
Jeremiah|32|37|Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
Jeremiah|32|38|and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
Jeremiah|32|39|and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
Jeremiah|32|40|and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.
Jeremiah|32|41|Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
Jeremiah|32|42|For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
Jeremiah|32|43|And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|32|44|Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|33|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|33|2|Thus saith Jehovah that doeth it, Jehovah that formeth it to establish it; Jehovah is his name:
Jeremiah|33|3|Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not.
Jeremiah|33|4|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down {to make a defence} against the mounds and against the sword;
Jeremiah|33|5|while {men} come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:
Jeremiah|33|6|Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth.
Jeremiah|33|7|And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
Jeremiah|33|8|And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
Jeremiah|33|9|And {this city} shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.
Jeremiah|33|10|Thus saith Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,
Jeremiah|33|11|the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, Give thanks to Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever; {and of them} that bring {sacrifices of} thanksgiving into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|33|12|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
Jeremiah|33|13|In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|33|14|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
Jeremiah|33|15|In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah|33|16|In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is {the name} whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
Jeremiah|33|17|For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
Jeremiah|33|18|neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
Jeremiah|33|19|And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|33|20|Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;
Jeremiah|33|21|then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
Jeremiah|33|22|As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
Jeremiah|33|23|And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|33|24|Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah did choose, he hath cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
Jeremiah|33|25|Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night {stand} not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
Jeremiah|33|26|then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.
Jeremiah|34|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying:
Jeremiah|34|2|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
Jeremiah|34|3|and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
Jeremiah|34|4|Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus saith Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword;
Jeremiah|34|5|thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, {saying}, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|34|6|Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
Jeremiah|34|7|when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these {alone} remained of the cities of Judah {as} fortified cities.
Jeremiah|34|8|The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
Jeremiah|34|9|that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, that is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, {to wit}, of a Jew his brother.
Jeremiah|34|10|And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:
Jeremiah|34|11|but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
Jeremiah|34|12|Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|34|13|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
Jeremiah|34|14|At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
Jeremiah|34|15|And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
Jeremiah|34|16|but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
Jeremiah|34|17|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.
Jeremiah|34|18|And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;
Jeremiah|34|19|the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;
Jeremiah|34|20|I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|34|21|And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone away from you.
Jeremiah|34|22|Behold, I will command, saith Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|35|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|35|2|Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
Jeremiah|35|3|Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
Jeremiah|35|4|and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
Jeremiah|35|5|And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.
Jeremiah|35|6|But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:
Jeremiah|35|7|neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn.
Jeremiah|35|8|And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;
Jeremiah|35|9|nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
Jeremiah|35|10|but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
Jeremiah|35|11|But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|35|12|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|35|13|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|35|14|The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me.
Jeremiah|35|15|I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
Jeremiah|35|16|Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;
Jeremiah|35|17|therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
Jeremiah|35|18|And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;
Jeremiah|35|19|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
Jeremiah|36|1|And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|36|2|Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
Jeremiah|36|3|It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Jeremiah|36|4|Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
Jeremiah|36|5|And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:
Jeremiah|36|6|therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
Jeremiah|36|7|It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.
Jeremiah|36|8|And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah’s house.
Jeremiah|36|9|Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.
Jeremiah|36|10|Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s house, in the ears of all the people.
Jeremiah|36|11|And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,
Jeremiah|36|12|he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes were sitting there, {to wit}, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
Jeremiah|36|13|Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
Jeremiah|36|14|Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
Jeremiah|36|15|And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
Jeremiah|36|16|Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
Jeremiah|36|17|And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
Jeremiah|36|18|Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
Jeremiah|36|19|Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.
Jeremiah|36|20|And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.
Jeremiah|36|21|So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.
Jeremiah|36|22|Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and {there was a fire in} the brazier burning before him.
Jeremiah|36|23|And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that {the king} cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
Jeremiah|36|24|And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
Jeremiah|36|25|Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.
Jeremiah|36|26|And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.
Jeremiah|36|27|Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|36|28|Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
Jeremiah|36|29|And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
Jeremiah|36|30|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
Jeremiah|36|31|And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.
Jeremiah|36|32|Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.
Jeremiah|37|1|And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah|37|2|But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|37|3|And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.
Jeremiah|37|4|Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.
Jeremiah|37|5|And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|37|6|Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|37|7|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
Jeremiah|37|8|And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah|37|9|Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.
Jeremiah|37|10|For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yea would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
Jeremiah|37|11|And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,
Jeremiah|37|12|then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.
Jeremiah|37|13|And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|37|14|Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
Jeremiah|37|15|And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
Jeremiah|37|16|When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
Jeremiah|37|17|Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|37|18|Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
Jeremiah|37|19|Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
Jeremiah|37|20|And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
Jeremiah|37|21|Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|38|1|And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,
Jeremiah|38|2|Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.
Jeremiah|38|3|Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
Jeremiah|38|4|Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
Jeremiah|38|5|And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.
Jeremiah|38|6|Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
Jeremiah|38|7|Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)
Jeremiah|38|8|Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,
Jeremiah|38|9|My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.
Jeremiah|38|10|Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
Jeremiah|38|11|So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|38|12|And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
Jeremiah|38|13|So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|38|14|Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
Jeremiah|38|15|Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.
Jeremiah|38|16|So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
Jeremiah|38|17|Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.
Jeremiah|38|18|But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
Jeremiah|38|19|And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
Jeremiah|38|20|But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.
Jeremiah|38|21|But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:
Jeremiah|38|22|behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: {now that} thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.
Jeremiah|38|23|And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
Jeremiah|38|24|Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
Jeremiah|38|25|But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
Jeremiah|38|26|then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.
Jeremiah|38|27|Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
Jeremiah|38|28|So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah|39|1|And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;
Jeremiah|39|2|in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city,)
Jeremiah|39|3|that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, {to wit}, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|39|4|And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.
Jeremiah|39|5|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.
Jeremiah|39|6|Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah|39|7|Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
Jeremiah|39|8|And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|39|9|Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.
Jeremiah|39|10|But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
Jeremiah|39|11|Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|39|12|Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
Jeremiah|39|13|So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;
Jeremiah|39|14|they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
Jeremiah|39|15|Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|39|16|Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.
Jeremiah|39|17|But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.
Jeremiah|39|18|For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|40|1|The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.
Jeremiah|40|2|And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;
Jeremiah|40|3|and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
Jeremiah|40|4|And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.
Jeremiah|40|5|Now while he was not yet gone back, Go back then, {said he}, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.
Jeremiah|40|6|Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
Jeremiah|40|7|Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
Jeremiah|40|8|then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, {to wit}, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
Jeremiah|40|9|And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
Jeremiah|40|10|As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
Jeremiah|40|11|Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;
Jeremiah|40|12|then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
Jeremiah|40|13|Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
Jeremiah|40|14|and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
Jeremiah|40|15|Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
Jeremiah|40|16|But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
Jeremiah|41|1|Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal and {one of} the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
Jeremiah|41|2|Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
Jeremiah|41|3|Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, {to wit}, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.
Jeremiah|41|4|And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
Jeremiah|41|5|that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|41|6|And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
Jeremiah|41|7|And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, {and cast them} into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.
Jeremiah|41|8|But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
Jeremiah|41|9|Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
Jeremiah|41|10|Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
Jeremiah|41|11|But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
Jeremiah|41|12|then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
Jeremiah|41|13|Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
Jeremiah|41|14|So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah|41|15|But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
Jeremiah|41|16|Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, {to wit}, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:
Jeremiah|41|17|and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
Jeremiah|41|18|because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.
Jeremiah|42|1|Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
Jeremiah|42|2|and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:
Jeremiah|42|3|that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
Jeremiah|42|4|Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.
Jeremiah|42|5|Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.
Jeremiah|42|6|Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|42|7|And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|42|8|Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
Jeremiah|42|9|and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:
Jeremiah|42|10|If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
Jeremiah|42|11|Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah|42|12|And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
Jeremiah|42|13|But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God,
Jeremiah|42|14|saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
Jeremiah|42|15|now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
Jeremiah|42|16|then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
Jeremiah|42|17|So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
Jeremiah|42|18|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
Jeremiah|42|19|Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day.
Jeremiah|42|20|For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it:
Jeremiah|42|21|and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.
Jeremiah|42|22|Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.
Jeremiah|43|1|And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
Jeremiah|43|2|then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
Jeremiah|43|3|but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.
Jeremiah|43|4|So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah|43|5|But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;
Jeremiah|43|6|the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;
Jeremiah|43|7|and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came unto Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah|43|8|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Jeremiah|43|9|Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
Jeremiah|43|10|and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
Jeremiah|43|11|And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death {shall be given} to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
Jeremiah|43|12|And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
Jeremiah|43|13|He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.
Jeremiah|44|1|The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
Jeremiah|44|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
Jeremiah|44|3|because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, {and} to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.
Jeremiah|44|4|Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
Jeremiah|44|5|But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
Jeremiah|44|6|Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|7|Therefore now thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye {this} great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;
Jeremiah|44|8|in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
Jeremiah|44|9|Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah|44|10|They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
Jeremiah|44|11|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.
Jeremiah|44|12|And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, {and} an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
Jeremiah|44|13|For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
Jeremiah|44|14|so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.
Jeremiah|44|15|Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|44|16|As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee.
Jeremiah|44|17|But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
Jeremiah|44|18|But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
Jeremiah|44|19|And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?
Jeremiah|44|20|Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,
Jeremiah|44|21|The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind?
Jeremiah|44|22|so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|23|Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|24|Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah|44|25|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.
Jeremiah|44|26|Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth.
Jeremiah|44|27|Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
Jeremiah|44|28|And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
Jeremiah|44|29|And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
Jeremiah|44|30|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who was his enemy, and sought his life.
Jeremiah|45|1|The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these word in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|45|2|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:
Jeremiah|45|3|Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
Jeremiah|45|4|Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.

Jeremiah|46|9|Go up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield; and the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.
Jeremiah|46|10|For that day is {a day} of the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.

Jeremiah|51|55|For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:

Jeremiah|51|59|The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.
Jeremiah|51|60|And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
Jeremiah|51|61|And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,
Jeremiah|51|62|and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
Jeremiah|51|63|And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:

Jeremiah|52|1|Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
Jeremiah|52|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah|52|3|For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|52|4|And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
Jeremiah|52|5|So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
Jeremiah|52|6|In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
Jeremiah|52|7|Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;) and they went toward the Arabah.
Jeremiah|52|8|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
Jeremiah|52|9|Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.
Jeremiah|52|10|And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
Jeremiah|52|11|And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
Jeremiah|52|12|Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:
Jeremiah|52|13|and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.
Jeremiah|52|14|And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
Jeremiah|52|15|Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
Jeremiah|52|16|But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
Jeremiah|52|17|And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|52|18|The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
Jeremiah|52|19|And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls-that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,- the captain of the guard took away.
Jeremiah|52|20|The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
Jeremiah|52|21|And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
Jeremiah|52|22|And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.
Jeremiah|52|23|And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
Jeremiah|52|24|And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:
Jeremiah|52|25|and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king’s face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
Jeremiah|52|26|And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
Jeremiah|52|27|And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
Jeremiah|52|28|This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;
Jeremiah|52|29|in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons;
Jeremiah|52|30|in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
Jeremiah|52|31|And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the {first} year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;
Jeremiah|52|32|and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
Jeremiah|52|33|and changed his prison garments. And {Jehoiachin} did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:
Jeremiah|52|34|and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

Isaiah|2|20|In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
Isaiah|2|21|to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
Isaiah|2|22|Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?
Isaiah|3|1|For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;
Isaiah|3|2|the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;
Isaiah|3|3|the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.
Isaiah|3|4|And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
Isaiah|3|5|And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
Isaiah|3|6|When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, {saying}, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;
Isaiah|3|7|in that day shall he lift up {his voice}, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.
Isaiah|3|8|For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
Isaiah|3|9|The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.
Isaiah|3|10|Say ye of the righteous, that {it shall be} well {with him}; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Isaiah|3|11|Woe unto the wicked! {it shall be} ill {with him}; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.
Isaiah|3|12|As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
Isaiah|3|13|Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.
Isaiah|3|14|Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:
Isaiah|3|15|what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|3|16|Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;
Isaiah|3|17|therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.
Isaiah|3|18|In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;
Isaiah|3|19|the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;
Isaiah|3|20|the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;
Isaiah|3|21|the rings, and the nose-jewels;
Isaiah|3|22|the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;
Isaiah|3|23|the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.
Isaiah|3|24|And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.
Isaiah|3|25|Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
Isaiah|3|26|And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.
Isaiah|4|1|And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.

Isaiah|4|3|And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;
Isaiah|4|4|when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
Isaiah|4|5|And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory {shall be spread} a covering.
Isaiah|4|6|And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
Isaiah|5|1|Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
Isaiah|5|2|and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
Isaiah|5|3|And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
Isaiah|5|4|What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
Isaiah|5|5|And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
Isaiah|5|6|and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
Isaiah|5|7|For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.
Isaiah|5|8|Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
Isaiah|5|9|In mine ears {saith} Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
Isaiah|5|10|For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield {but} an ephah.
Isaiah|5|11|Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!
Isaiah|5|12|And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are {in} their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
Isaiah|5|13|Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
Isaiah|5|14|Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend {into it}.
Isaiah|5|15|And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:
Isaiah|5|16|but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
Isaiah|5|17|Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.
Isaiah|5|18|Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;
Isaiah|5|19|that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
Isaiah|5|20|Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
Isaiah|5|21|Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Isaiah|5|22|Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;
Isaiah|5|23|that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
Isaiah|5|24|Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|5|25|Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|5|26|And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
Isaiah|5|27|None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Isaiah|5|28|whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:
Isaiah|5|29|their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.
Isaiah|5|30|And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness {and} distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.
Isaiah|6|1|In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
Isaiah|6|2|Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
Isaiah|6|3|And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
Isaiah|6|4|And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Isaiah|6|5|Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|6|6|Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
Isaiah|6|7|and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.
Isaiah|6|8|And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
Isaiah|6|9|And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
Isaiah|6|10|Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
Isaiah|6|11|Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,
Isaiah|6|12|and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
Isaiah|6|13|And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
Isaiah|7|1|And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
Isaiah|7|2|And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
Isaiah|7|3|Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;
Isaiah|7|4|and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah|7|5|Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,
Isaiah|7|6|Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;
Isaiah|7|7|thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
Isaiah|7|8|For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people:
Isaiah|7|9|and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
Isaiah|7|10|And Jehovah spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
Isaiah|7|11|Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
Isaiah|7|12|But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah.
Isaiah|7|13|And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?
Isaiah|7|14|Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
Isaiah|7|15|Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
Isaiah|7|16|For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.
Isaiah|7|17|Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah-{even} the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|7|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah|7|19|And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.
Isaiah|7|20|In that day will the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, {even} with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.
Isaiah|7|21|And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;
Isaiah|7|22|and it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.
Isaiah|7|23|And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall be for briers and thorns.
Isaiah|7|24|With arrows and with bow shall one come thither, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.
Isaiah|7|25|And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.
Isaiah|8|1|And Jehovah said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
Isaiah|8|2|and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
Isaiah|8|3|And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said Jehovah unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
Isaiah|8|4|For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|8|5|And Jehovah spake unto me yet again, saying,
Isaiah|8|6|Forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;
Isaiah|8|7|now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, {even} the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks;
Isaiah|8|8|and it shall sweep onward into Judah; it shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
Isaiah|8|9|Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.
Isaiah|8|10|Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
Isaiah|8|11|For Jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
Isaiah|8|12|Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people shall say, A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread {thereof}.
Isaiah|8|13|Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
Isaiah|8|14|And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah|8|15|And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
Isaiah|8|16|Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
Isaiah|8|17|And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
Isaiah|8|18|Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.
Isaiah|8|19|And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living {should they seek} unto the dead?
Isaiah|8|20|To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
Isaiah|8|21|And they shall pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward:
Isaiah|8|22|and they shall look unto the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness {they shall be} driven away.
Isaiah|9|1|But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
Isaiah|9|2|The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
Isaiah|9|3|Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
Isaiah|9|4|For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.
Isaiah|9|5|For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.
Isaiah|9|6|For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
Isaiah|9|7|Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah|9|8|The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
Isaiah|9|9|And all the people shall know, {even} Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,
Isaiah|9|10|The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
Isaiah|9|11|Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
Isaiah|9|12|the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|9|13|Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|9|14|Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.
Isaiah|9|15|The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
Isaiah|9|16|For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
Isaiah|9|17|Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|9|18|For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
Isaiah|9|19|Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.
Isaiah|9|20|And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
Isaiah|9|21|Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|10|1|Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness;
Isaiah|10|2|to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
Isaiah|10|3|And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
Isaiah|10|4|They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|10|5|Ho Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, the staff in whose hand is mine indignation!
Isaiah|10|6|I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
Isaiah|10|7|Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
Isaiah|10|8|For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings?
Isaiah|10|9|Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
Isaiah|10|10|As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
Isaiah|10|11|shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
Isaiah|10|12|Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
Isaiah|10|13|For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding: and I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and like a valiant man I have brought down them that sit {on thrones}:
Isaiah|10|14|and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.
Isaiah|10|15|Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it? as if a rod should wield them that lift it up, {or} as if a staff should lift up {him that is} not wood.
Isaiah|10|16|Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.
Isaiah|10|17|And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
Isaiah|10|18|And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
Isaiah|10|19|And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.
Isaiah|10|20|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
Isaiah|10|21|A remnant shall return, {even} the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
Isaiah|10|22|For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, {only} a remnant of them shall return: a destruction {is} determined, overflowing with righteousness.
Isaiah|10|23|For a full end, and that determined, will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.
Isaiah|10|24|Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
Isaiah|10|25|For yet a very little while, and the indignation {against thee} shall be accomplished, and mine anger {shall be directed} to his destruction.
Isaiah|10|26|And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
Isaiah|10|27|And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.
Isaiah|10|28|He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;
Isaiah|10|29|they are gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah trembleth; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
Isaiah|10|30|Cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! hearken, O Laishah! O thou poor Anathoth!
Isaiah|10|31|Madmenah is a fugitive; the inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
Isaiah|10|32|This very day shall he halt at Nob: he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Isaiah|10|33|Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will lop the boughs with terror: and the high of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be brought low.
Isaiah|10|34|And he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
Isaiah|11|1|And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit.
Isaiah|11|2|And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.
Isaiah|11|3|And his delight shall be in the fear of Jehovah; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the hearing of his ears;
Isaiah|11|4|but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
Isaiah|11|5|And righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and faithfulness the girdle of his loins.
Isaiah|11|6|And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
Isaiah|11|7|And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
Isaiah|11|8|And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den.
Isaiah|11|9|They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
Isaiah|11|10|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, that standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting-place shall be glorious.
