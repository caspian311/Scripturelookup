Matthew|1|1|The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Matthew|1|2|Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
Matthew|1|3|and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;
Matthew|1|4|and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;
Matthew|1|5|and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
Matthew|1|6|and Jesse begat David the king.      And David begat Solomon of her {that had been the wife} of Uriah;
Matthew|1|7|and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;
Matthew|1|8|and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;
Matthew|1|9|and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;
Matthew|1|10|and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;
Matthew|1|11|and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
Matthew|1|12|And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;
Matthew|1|13|and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
Matthew|1|14|and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
Matthew|1|15|and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
Matthew|1|16|and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Matthew|1|17|So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.
Matthew|1|18|Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|19|And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
Matthew|1|20|But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|21|And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.
Matthew|1|22|Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
Matthew|1|23|Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,                   And they shall call his name Immanuel;            which is, being interpreted, God with us.
Matthew|1|24|And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;
Matthew|1|25|and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
Matthew|2|1|Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew|2|2|Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
Matthew|2|3|And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew|2|4|And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
Matthew|2|5|And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet,
Matthew|2|6|And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,                   Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah:                   For out of thee shall come forth a governor,                   Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.
Matthew|2|7|Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.
Matthew|2|8|And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found {him,} bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.
Matthew|2|9|And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
Matthew|2|10|And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Matthew|2|11|And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew|2|12|And being warned {of God} in a dream that they should not  return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
Matthew|2|13|Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Matthew|2|14|And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;
Matthew|2|15|and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son.
Matthew|2|16|Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.
Matthew|2|17|Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|2|18|A voice was heard in Ramah,                   Weeping and great mourning,                   Rachel weeping for her children;                   And she would not be comforted, because they are not.
Matthew|2|19|But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
Matthew|2|20|Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.
Matthew|2|21|And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew|2|22|But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned {of God} in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,
Matthew|2|23|and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.
Matthew|3|1|And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,
Matthew|3|2|Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|3|3|For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying,             The voice of one crying in the wilderness,                   Make ye ready the way of the Lord,                   Make his paths straight.
Matthew|3|4|Now John himself had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew|3|5|Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;
Matthew|3|6|and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew|3|7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:
Matthew|3|9|and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Matthew|3|10|And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew|3|11|I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and {in} fire:
Matthew|3|12|whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Matthew|3|13|Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
Matthew|3|14|But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew|3|15|But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer {it} now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffereth him.
Matthew|3|16|And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;
Matthew|3|17|and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Matthew|4|1|Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
Matthew|4|2|And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
Matthew|4|3|And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
Matthew|4|4|But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
Matthew|4|5|Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew|4|6|and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,             He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:            and,             On their hands they shall bear thee up,                   Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Matthew|4|7|Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
Matthew|4|8|Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
Matthew|4|9|and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Matthew|4|10|Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Matthew|4|11|Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
Matthew|4|12|Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;
Matthew|4|13|and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
Matthew|4|14|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|4|15|The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,                   Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,                   Galilee of the Gentiles,
Matthew|4|16|The people that sat in darkness                   Saw a great light,                   And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,                   To them did light spring up.
Matthew|4|17|From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|4|18|And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
Matthew|4|19|And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew|4|20|And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
Matthew|4|21|And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
Matthew|4|22|And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.
Matthew|4|23|And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.
Matthew|4|24|And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
Matthew|4|25|And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and {from} beyond the Jordan.
Matthew|5|1|And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:
