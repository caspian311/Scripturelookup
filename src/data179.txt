1 Timothy|6|6|But godliness with contentment is great gain:
1 Timothy|6|7|for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;
1 Timothy|6|8|but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.
1 Timothy|6|9|But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.
1 Timothy|6|10|For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1 Timothy|6|11|But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
1 Timothy|6|12|Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
1 Timothy|6|13|I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;
1 Timothy|6|14|that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Timothy|6|15|which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1 Timothy|6|16|who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom {be} honor and power eternal. Amen.
1 Timothy|6|17|Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
1 Timothy|6|18|that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1 Timothy|6|19|laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is {life} indeed.
1 Timothy|6|20|O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto {thee}, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;
1 Timothy|6|21|which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
2 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;
2 Thessalonians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|1|3|We are bound to give thanks to God always to you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith growth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth;
2 Thessalonians|1|4|so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;
2 Thessalonians|1|5|{which is} a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
2 Thessalonians|1|6|if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you,
2 Thessalonians|1|7|and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,
2 Thessalonians|1|8|rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus:
2 Thessalonians|1|9|who shall suffer punishment, {even} eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
2 Thessalonians|1|10|when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.
2 Thessalonians|1|11|To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and {every} work of faith, with power;
2 Thessalonians|1|12|that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|2|1|Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;
2 Thessalonians|2|2|to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;
2 Thessalonians|2|3|let no man beguile you in any wise: for {it will not be,} except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
2 Thessalonians|2|4|he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.
2 Thessalonians|2|5|Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians|2|6|And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
2 Thessalonians|2|7|For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only {there is} one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians|2|8|And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;
2 Thessalonians|2|9|{even he}, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
2 Thessalonians|2|10|and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2 Thessalonians|2|11|And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:
2 Thessalonians|2|12|that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians|2|13|But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
2 Thessalonians|2|14|whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|2|15|So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
2 Thessalonians|2|16|Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians|2|17|comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians|3|1|Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also {it is} with you;
2 Thessalonians|3|2|and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.
2 Thessalonians|3|3|But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil {one}.
2 Thessalonians|3|4|And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.
2 Thessalonians|3|5|And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
2 Thessalonians|3|6|Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
2 Thessalonians|3|7|For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians|3|8|neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:
2 Thessalonians|3|9|not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.
2 Thessalonians|3|10|For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.
2 Thessalonians|3|11|For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.
2 Thessalonians|3|12|Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians|3|13|But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.
2 Thessalonians|3|14|And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians|3|15|And {yet} count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians|3|16|Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians|3|17|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
2 Thessalonians|3|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Mark|1|1|The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mark|1|2|Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.
Mark|1|3|The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;
Mark|1|4|John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.
Mark|1|5|And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark|1|6|And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and {had} a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.
Mark|1|7|And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
Mark|1|8|I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
Mark|1|9|And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
Mark|1|10|And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:
Mark|1|11|And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
Mark|1|12|And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.
Mark|1|13|And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.
Mark|1|14|Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
Mark|1|15|and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.
Mark|1|16|And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.
Mark|1|17|And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark|1|18|And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.
Mark|1|19|And going on a little further, he saw James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.
Mark|1|20|And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
Mark|1|21|And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
Mark|1|22|And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark|1|23|And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark|1|24|saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Mark|1|25|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Mark|1|26|And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark|1|27|And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
Mark|1|28|And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
Mark|1|29|And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark|1|30|Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:
Mark|1|31|and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
Mark|1|32|And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.
Mark|1|33|And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark|1|34|And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Mark|1|35|And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.
Mark|1|36|And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
Mark|1|37|and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.
