Revelation|18|1|After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
Revelation|18|2|And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.
Revelation|18|3|For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness.
Revelation|18|4|And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:
Revelation|18|5|for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
Revelation|18|6|Render unto her even as she rendered, and double {unto her} the double according to her works: in the cup which she mingled, mingle unto her double.
Revelation|18|7|How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.
Revelation|18|8|Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.
Revelation|18|9|And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,
Revelation|18|10|standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
Revelation|18|11|And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more;
Revelation|18|12|merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
Revelation|18|13|and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and {merchandise} of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men.
Revelation|18|14|And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee, and {men} shall find them no more at all.
Revelation|18|15|The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
Revelation|18|16|saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl!
Revelation|18|17|for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off,
Revelation|18|18|and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What {city} is like the great city?
Revelation|18|19|And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
Revelation|18|20|Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.
Revelation|18|21|And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all.
Revelation|18|22|And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;
Revelation|18|23|and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.
Revelation|18|24|And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.
Revelation|19|1|After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,      Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God:
Revelation|19|2|for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
Revelation|19|3|And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.
Revelation|19|4|And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
Revelation|19|5|And a voice came forth from the throne, saying,      Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great.
Revelation|19|6|And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,      Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.
Revelation|19|7|Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
Revelation|19|8|And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright {and} pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
Revelation|19|9|And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God.
Revelation|19|10|And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
Revelation|19|11|And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
Revelation|19|12|And his eyes {are} a flame of fire, and upon his head {are} many diadems; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself.
Revelation|19|13|And he {is} arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
Revelation|19|14|And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white {and} pure.
Revelation|19|15|And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|19|16|And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation|19|17|And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven, Come {and} be gathered together unto the great supper of God;
Revelation|19|18|that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great.
Revelation|19|19|And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army.
Revelation|19|20|And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone:
Revelation|19|21|and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, {even the sword} which came forth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
Revelation|20|1|And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation|20|2|And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
Revelation|20|3|and cast him into the abyss, and shut {it}, and sealed {it} over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.
Revelation|20|4|And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and {I saw} the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Revelation|20|5|The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation|20|6|Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
Revelation|20|7|And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
Revelation|20|8|and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
Revelation|20|9|And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.
Revelation|20|10|And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Revelation|20|11|And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
Revelation|20|12|And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is {the book} of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
Revelation|20|13|And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
Revelation|20|14|And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, {even} the lake of fire.
Revelation|20|15|And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
Revelation|21|1|And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.
Revelation|21|2|And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation|21|3|And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, {and be} their God:
Revelation|21|4|and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away.
Revelation|21|5|And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.
Revelation|21|6|And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
Revelation|21|7|He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
Revelation|21|8|But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part {shall be} in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
Revelation|21|9|And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|10|And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation|21|11|having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:
Revelation|21|12|having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are {the names} of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
Revelation|21|13|on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
Revelation|21|14|And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|15|And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
Revelation|21|16|And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.
Revelation|21|17|And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, {according to} the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
Revelation|21|18|And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.
Revelation|21|19|The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
Revelation|21|20|the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
Revelation|21|21|And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
Revelation|21|22|And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.
Revelation|21|23|And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof {is} the Lamb.
Revelation|21|24|And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
Revelation|21|25|And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):
Revelation|21|26|and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:
Revelation|21|27|and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
Revelation|22|1|And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,
Revelation|22|2|in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve {manner of} fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
Revelation|22|3|And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him;
Revelation|22|4|and they shall see his face; and his name {shall be} on their foreheads.
Revelation|22|5|And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
Revelation|22|6|And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
Revelation|22|7|And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
Revelation|22|8|And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
Revelation|22|9|And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.
Revelation|22|10|And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
Revelation|22|11|He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still.
Revelation|22|12|Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is.
Revelation|22|13|I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
