Leviticus|21|24|So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
Leviticus|22|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|2|Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|3|Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|4|What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Leviticus|22|5|or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Leviticus|22|6|the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
Leviticus|22|7|And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
Leviticus|22|8|That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|9|They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|22|10|There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|11|But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
Leviticus|22|12|And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.
Leviticus|22|13|But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
Leviticus|22|14|And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|15|And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,
Leviticus|22|16|and {so} cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|22|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|18|Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus|22|19|that ye may be accepted, {ye shall offer} a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Leviticus|22|20|But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus|22|21|And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Leviticus|22|22|Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|23|Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Leviticus|22|24|That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do {thus} in your land.
Leviticus|22|25|Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
Leviticus|22|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|27|When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|28|And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
Leviticus|22|29|And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus|22|30|On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|31|Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|32|And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,
Leviticus|22|33|who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Leviticus|23|3|Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|4|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
Leviticus|23|5|In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah’s passover.
Leviticus|23|6|And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus|23|7|In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|8|But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Leviticus|23|11|and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus|23|12|And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|13|And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
Leviticus|23|14|And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|15|And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:
Leviticus|23|16|even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|17|Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts {of an ephah}: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|18|And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|19|And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Leviticus|23|20|And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.
Leviticus|23|21|And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus|23|22|And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|24|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
Leviticus|23|25|Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|27|Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|28|And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|29|For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|23|30|And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Leviticus|23|31|Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|32|It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
Leviticus|23|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|34|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|35|On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|36|Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|37|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
Leviticus|23|38|besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|39|Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Leviticus|23|40|And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.
Leviticus|23|41|And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus|23|42|Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
Leviticus|23|43|that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|44|And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|2|Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus|24|3|Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Leviticus|24|4|He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.
Leviticus|24|5|And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts {of an ephah} shall be in one cake.
Leviticus|24|6|And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|7|And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|8|Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus|24|9|And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Leviticus|24|10|And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:
Leviticus|24|11|and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus|24|12|And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|13|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|14|Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus|24|15|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus|24|16|And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name {of Jehovah}, shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|17|And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|24|18|And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus|24|19|And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:
Leviticus|24|20|breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
Leviticus|24|21|And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|22|Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.
