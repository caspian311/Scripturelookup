Ezekiel|43|13|And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.
Ezekiel|43|14|And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
Ezekiel|43|15|And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
Ezekiel|43|16|And the altar hearth shall be twelve {cubits} long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.
Ezekiel|43|17|And the ledge shall be fourteen {cubits} long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|18|And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
Ezekiel|43|19|Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
Ezekiel|43|20|And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel|43|21|Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|43|22|And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
Ezekiel|43|23|When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|24|And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezekiel|43|25|Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|26|Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
Ezekiel|43|27|And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|44|1|Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
Ezekiel|44|2|And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
Ezekiel|44|3|As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
Ezekiel|44|4|Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel|44|5|And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|44|6|And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
Ezekiel|44|7|in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, {to add} unto all your abominations.
Ezekiel|44|8|And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
Ezekiel|44|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.
Ezekiel|44|10|But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|11|Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
Ezekiel|44|12|Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|13|And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel|44|14|Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
Ezekiel|44|15|But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah:
Ezekiel|44|16|they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
Ezekiel|44|17|And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
Ezekiel|44|18|They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with {anything that causeth} sweat.
Ezekiel|44|19|And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments.
Ezekiel|44|20|Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
Ezekiel|44|21|Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
Ezekiel|44|22|Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.
Ezekiel|44|23|And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
Ezekiel|44|24|And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|44|25|And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
Ezekiel|44|26|And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
Ezekiel|44|27|And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|44|28|And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
Ezekiel|44|29|They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.

Ezekiel|44|31|The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.
Ezekiel|45|1|Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand {reeds}, and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|2|Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred {in length} by five hundred {in breadth}, square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|3|And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.
Ezekiel|45|4|It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|45|5|And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, {for} twenty chambers.

Ezekiel|45|7|And {whatsoever is} for the prince {shall be} on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
Ezekiel|45|8|In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Ezekiel|45|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|10|Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

Ezekiel|45|12|And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
Ezekiel|45|13|This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;
Ezekiel|45|14|and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, {which is} ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)
Ezekiel|45|15|and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|16|All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel|45|17|And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|45|18|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.

Ezekiel|45|20|And so thou shalt do on the seventh {day} of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.
Ezekiel|45|21|In the first {month}, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

Ezekiel|46|2|And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.

Ezekiel|46|6|And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:
Ezekiel|46|7|and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|8|And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
Ezekiel|46|9|But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.
Ezekiel|46|10|And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth {together}.

Ezekiel|46|16|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
Ezekiel|46|17|But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.

Ezekiel|46|19|Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
Ezekiel|46|20|And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, {and} where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
Ezekiel|46|21|Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
Ezekiel|46|22|In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty {cubits} long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.
Ezekiel|46|23|And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
Ezekiel|46|24|Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
Ezekiel|47|1|And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.
Ezekiel|47|2|Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of {the gate} that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
Ezekiel|47|3|When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
Ezekiel|47|4|Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through {the waters}, waters that were to the loins.
Ezekiel|47|5|Afterward he measured a thousand; {and it was} a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
