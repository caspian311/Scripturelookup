Mark|9|15|And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
Mark|9|16|And he asked them, What question ye with them?
Mark|9|17|And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;
Mark|9|18|and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.
Mark|9|19|And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me.
Mark|9|20|And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Mark|9|21|And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child.
Mark|9|22|And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark|9|23|And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.
Mark|9|24|Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
Mark|9|25|And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
Mark|9|26|And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and {the boy} became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.
Mark|9|27|But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
Mark|9|28|And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, {How is it} that we could not cast it out?
Mark|9|29|And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.
Mark|9|30|And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
Mark|9|31|For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|9|32|But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark|9|33|And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?
Mark|9|34|But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who {was} the greatest.
Mark|9|35|And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark|9|36|And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,
Mark|9|37|Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
Mark|9|38|John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.
Mark|9|39|But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
Mark|9|40|For he that is not against us is for us.
Mark|9|41|For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Mark|9|42|And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
Mark|9|43|And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
Mark|9|44|{where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.}
Mark|9|45|And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.
Mark|9|46|{where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.}
Mark|9|47|And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;
Mark|9|48|where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark|9|49|For every one shall be salted with fire.
Mark|9|50|Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
Mark|10|1|And he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of Judaea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
Mark|10|2|And there came unto him Pharisees, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away {his} wife? trying him.
Mark|10|3|And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark|10|4|And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
Mark|10|5|But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
Mark|10|6|But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them.
Mark|10|7|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
Mark|10|8|and the two shall become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
Mark|10|9|What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark|10|10|And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.
Mark|10|11|And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:
Mark|10|12|and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.
Mark|10|13|And they were bringing unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.
Mark|10|14|But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|15|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
Mark|10|16|And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
Mark|10|17|And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark|10|18|And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good save one, {even} God.
Mark|10|19|Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and mother.
Mark|10|20|And he said unto him, Teacher, all these things have I observed from my youth.
Mark|10|21|And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Mark|10|22|But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.
Mark|10|23|And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|24|And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|25|It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|26|And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?
Mark|10|27|Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
Mark|10|28|Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
Mark|10|29|Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,
Mark|10|30|but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
Mark|10|31|But many {that are} first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark|10|32|And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,
Mark|10|33|{saying}, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:
Mark|10|34|and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|10|35|And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.
Mark|10|36|And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark|10|37|And they said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on {thy} left hand, in thy glory.
Mark|10|38|But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Mark|10|39|And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
Mark|10|40|but to sit on my right hand or on {my} left hand is not mine to give; but {it is for them} for whom it hath been prepared.
Mark|10|41|And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.
Mark|10|42|And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Mark|10|43|But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;
Mark|10|44|and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.
Mark|10|45|For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mark|10|46|And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.
Mark|10|47|And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|48|And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|49|And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.
Mark|10|50|And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
Mark|10|51|And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
Mark|10|52|And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.
Mark|11|1|And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,
Mark|11|2|and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.
Mark|11|3|And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.
Mark|11|4|And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.
Mark|11|5|And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
Mark|11|6|And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.
Mark|11|7|And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.
Mark|11|8|And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.
Mark|11|9|And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark|11|10|Blessed {is} the kingdom that cometh, {the kingdom} of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.
Mark|11|11|And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
Mark|11|12|And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.
