Proverbs|5|13|Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,                   Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Proverbs|5|14|I was well-nigh in all evil                   In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
Proverbs|5|15|Drink waters out of thine own cistern,                   And running waters out of thine own well.
Proverbs|5|16|Should thy springs be dispersed abroad,                   And streams of water in the streets?
Proverbs|5|17|Let them be for thyself alone,                   And not for strangers with thee.
Proverbs|5|18|Let thy fountain be blessed;                   And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
Proverbs|5|19|{As} a loving hind and a pleasant doe,                   Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;                   And be thou ravished always with her love.
Proverbs|5|20|For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,                   And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Proverbs|5|21|For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah;                   And he maketh level all his paths.

Proverbs|6|1|My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor,                   If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;
Proverbs|6|2|Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,                   Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Proverbs|6|3|Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,                   Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor:                   Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;
Proverbs|6|4|Give not sleep to thine eyes,                   Nor slumber to thine eyelids;
Proverbs|6|5|Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand {of the hunter},                   And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs|6|6|Go to the ant, thou sluggard;                   Consider her ways, and be wise:
Proverbs|6|7|Which having no chief,                   Overseer, or ruler,
Proverbs|6|8|Provideth her bread in the summer,                   And gathereth her food in the harvest.
Proverbs|6|9|How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?                   When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Proverbs|6|10|{Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber,                   A little folding of the hands to sleep:
Proverbs|6|11|So shall thy poverty come as a robber,                   And thy want as an armed man.
Proverbs|6|12|A worthless person, a man of iniquity,                   Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;
Proverbs|6|13|That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet,                   That maketh signs with his fingers;
Proverbs|6|14|In whose heart is perverseness,                   Who deviseth evil continually,                   Who soweth discord.
Proverbs|6|15|Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;                   On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.
Proverbs|6|16|There are six things which Jehovah hateth;                   Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:
Proverbs|6|17|Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,                   And hands that shed innocent blood;
Proverbs|6|18|A heart that deviseth wicked purposes,                   Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
Proverbs|6|19|A false witness that uttereth lies,                   And he that soweth discord among brethren.
Proverbs|6|20|My son, keep the commandment of thy father,                   And forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs|6|21|Bind them continually upon thy heart;                   Tie them about thy neck.
Proverbs|6|22|When thou walkest, it shall lead thee;                   When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee;                   And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Proverbs|6|23|For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light;                   And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Proverbs|6|24|To keep thee from the evil woman,                   From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.
Proverbs|6|25|Lust not after her beauty in thy heart;                   Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Proverbs|6|26|For on account of a harlot {a man is brought} to a piece of bread;                   And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
Proverbs|6|27|Can a man take fire in his bosom,                   And his clothes not be burned?
Proverbs|6|28|Or can one walk upon hot coals,                   And his feet not be scorched?
Proverbs|6|29|So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife;                   Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.
Proverbs|6|30|Men do not despise a thief, if he steal                   To satisfy himself when he is hungry:
Proverbs|6|31|But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;                   He shall give all the substance of his house.
Proverbs|6|32|He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding:                   He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.
Proverbs|6|33|Wounds and dishonor shall he get;                   And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Proverbs|6|34|For jealousy is the rage of a man;                   And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Proverbs|6|35|He will not regard any ransom;                   Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
Proverbs|7|1|My son, keep my words,                   And lay up my commandments with thee.
Proverbs|7|2|Keep my commandments and live;                   And my law as the apple of thine eye.
Proverbs|7|3|Bind them upon thy fingers;                   Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
Proverbs|7|4|Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister;                   And call understanding {thy} kinswoman:
Proverbs|7|5|That they may keep thee from the strange woman,                   From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.
Proverbs|7|6|For at the window of my house                   I looked forth through my lattice;
Proverbs|7|7|And I beheld among the simple ones,                   I discerned among the youths,                   A young man void of understanding,
Proverbs|7|8|Passing through the street near her corner;                   And he went the way to her house,
Proverbs|7|9|In the twilight, in the evening of the day,                   In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
Proverbs|7|10|And, behold, there met him a woman                   With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
Proverbs|7|11|She is clamorous and wilful;                   Her feet abide not in her house:
Proverbs|7|12|Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places,                   And lieth in wait at every corner.
Proverbs|7|13|So she caught him, and kissed him,                           {And} with an impudent face she said unto him:
Proverbs|7|14|Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me;                   This day have I paid my vows.
Proverbs|7|15|Therefore came I forth to meet thee,                   Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Proverbs|7|16|I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,                   With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
Proverbs|7|17|I have perfumed my bed                   With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs|7|18|Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;                   Let us solace ourselves with loves.
Proverbs|7|19|For the man is not at home;                   He is gone a long journey:
Proverbs|7|20|He hath taken a bag of money with him;                   He will come home at the full moon.
Proverbs|7|21|With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield;                   With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.
Proverbs|7|22|He goeth after her straightway,                   As an ox goeth to the slaughter,                   Or as {one in} fetters to the correction of the fool;
Proverbs|7|23|Till an arrow strike through his liver;                   As a bird hasteth to the snare,                   And knoweth not that it is for his life.
Proverbs|7|24|Now therefore, {my} sons, hearken unto me,                   And attend to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs|7|25|Let not thy heart decline to her ways;                   Go not astray in her paths.
Proverbs|7|26|For she hath cast down many wounded:                   Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
Proverbs|7|27|Her house is the way to Sheol,                   Going down to the chambers of death.
Proverbs|8|1|Doth not wisdom cry,                   And understanding put forth her voice?
Proverbs|8|2|On the top of high places by the way,                   Where the paths meet, she standeth;
Proverbs|8|3|Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,                   At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
Proverbs|8|4|Unto you, O men, I call;                   And my voice is to the sons of men.
Proverbs|8|5|O ye simple, understand prudence;                   And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
Proverbs|8|6|Hear, for I will speak excellent things;                   And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
Proverbs|8|7|For my mouth shall utter truth;                   And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
Proverbs|8|8|All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;                   There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
Proverbs|8|9|They are all plain to him that understandeth,                   And right to them that find knowledge.
Proverbs|8|10|Receive my instruction, and not silver;                   And knowledge rather than choice gold.
Proverbs|8|11|For wisdom is better than rubies;                   And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.
Proverbs|8|12|I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling,                   And find out knowledge {and} discretion.
Proverbs|8|13|The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil:                   Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,                   And the perverse mouth, do I hate.
Proverbs|8|14|Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge:                   I am understanding; I have might.
Proverbs|8|15|By me kings reign,                   And princes decree justice.
Proverbs|8|16|By me princes rule,                   And nobles, {even} all the judges of the earth.
Proverbs|8|17|I love them that love me;                   And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
Proverbs|8|18|Riches and honor are with me;                           {Yea}, durable wealth and righteousness.
Proverbs|8|19|My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;                   And my revenue than choice silver.
Proverbs|8|20|I walk in the way of righteousness,                   In the midst of the paths of justice;
Proverbs|8|21|That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance,                   And that I may fill their treasuries.
Proverbs|8|22|Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way,                   Before his works of old.
Proverbs|8|23|I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,                   Before the earth was.
Proverbs|8|24|When there were no depths, I was brought forth,                   When there were no fountains abounding with water.
Proverbs|8|25|Before the mountains were settled,                   Before the hills was I brought forth;
Proverbs|8|26|While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,                   Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
Proverbs|8|27|When he established the heavens, I was there:                   When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
