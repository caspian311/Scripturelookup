Job|4|13|In thoughts from the visions of the night,                   When deep sleep falleth on men,
Job|4|14|Fear came upon me, and trembling,                   Which made all my bones to shake.
Job|4|15|Then a spirit passed before my face;                   The hair of my flesh stood up.
Job|4|16|It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;                   A form was before mine eyes:                           {There was} silence, and I heard a voice, {saying},
Job|4|17|Shall mortal man be more just than God?                   Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
Job|4|18|Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;                   And his angels he chargeth with folly:
Job|4|19|How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,                   Whose foundation is in the dust,                   Who are crushed before the moth!
Job|4|20|Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:                   They perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job|4|21|Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?                   They die, and that without wisdom.
Job|5|1|Call now; is there any that will answer thee?                   And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
Job|5|2|For vexation killeth the foolish man,                   And jealousy slayeth the silly one.
Job|5|3|I have seen the foolish taking root:                   But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job|5|4|His children are far from safety,                   And they are crushed in the gate,                   Neither is there any to deliver them:
Job|5|5|Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,                   And taketh it even out of the thorns;                   And the snare gapeth for their substance.
Job|5|6|For affliction cometh not forth from the dust,                   Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
Job|5|7|But man is born unto trouble,                   As the sparks fly upward.
Job|5|8|But as for me, I would seek unto God,                   And unto God would I commit my cause;
Job|5|9|Who doeth great things and unsearchable,                   Marvellous things without number:
Job|5|10|Who giveth rain upon the earth,                   And sendeth waters upon the fields;
Job|5|11|So that he setteth up on high those that are low,                   And those that mourn are exalted to safety.
Job|5|12|He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,                   So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
Job|5|13|He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;                   And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
Job|5|14|They meet with darkness in the day-time,                   And grope at noonday as in the night.
Job|5|15|But he saveth from the sword of their mouth,                   Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
Job|5|16|So the poor hath hope,                   And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
Job|5|17|Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:                   Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
Job|5|18|For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;                   He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
Job|5|19|He will deliver thee in six troubles;                   Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
Job|5|20|In famine he will redeem thee from death;                   And in war from the power of the sword.
Job|5|21|Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;                   Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job|5|22|At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;                   Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job|5|23|For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;                   And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job|5|24|And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;                   And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.
Job|5|25|Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,                   And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job|5|26|Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,                   Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.
Job|5|27|Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;                   Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
Job|6|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|6|2|Oh that my vexation were but weighed,                   And all my calamity laid in the balances!
Job|6|3|For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:                   Therefore have my words been rash.
Job|6|4|For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,                   The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:                   The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
Job|6|5|Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?                   Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job|6|6|Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt?                   Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job|6|7|My soul refuseth to touch {them};                   They are as loathsome food to me.
Job|6|8|Oh that I might have my request;                   And that God would grant {me} the thing that I long for!
Job|6|9|Even that it would please God to crush me;                   That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
Job|6|10|And be it still my consolation,                   Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not,                   That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job|6|11|What is my strength, that I should wait?                   And what is mine end, that I should be patient?
Job|6|12|Is my strength the strength of stones?                   Or is my flesh of brass?
Job|6|13|Is it not that I have no help in me,                   And that wisdom is driven quite from me?
Job|6|14|To him that is ready to faint kindness {should be showed} from his friend;                   Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job|6|15|My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,                   As the channel of brooks that pass away;
Job|6|16|Which are black by reason of the ice,                           {And} wherein the snow hideth itself:
Job|6|17|What time they wax warm, they vanish;                   When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
Job|6|18|The caravans {that travel} by the way of them turn aside;                   They go up into the waste, and perish.
Job|6|19|The caravans of Tema looked,                   The companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job|6|20|They were put to shame because they had hoped;                   They came thither, and were confounded.
Job|6|21|For now ye are nothing;                   Ye see a terror, and are afraid.
Job|6|22|Did I say, Give unto me?                   Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?
Job|6|23|Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?                   Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
Job|6|24|Teach me, and I will hold my peace;                   And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job|6|25|How forcible are words of uprightness!                   But your reproof, what doth it reprove?
Job|6|26|Do ye think to reprove words,                   Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?
Job|6|27|Yea, ye would cast {lots} upon the fatherless,                   And make merchandise of your friend.
Job|6|28|Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;                   For surely I shall not lie to your face.
Job|6|29|Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;                   Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
Job|6|30|Is there injustice on my tongue?                   Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
Job|7|1|Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?                   And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
Job|7|2|As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,                   And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:
Job|7|3|So am I made to possess months of misery,                   And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
Job|7|4|When I lie down, I say,                   When shall I arise, and the night be gone?                   And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
Job|7|5|My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;                   My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.
Job|7|6|My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,                   And are spent without hope.
Job|7|7|Oh remember that my life is a breath:                   Mine eye shall no more see good.
Job|7|8|The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;                   Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
Job|7|9|As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,                   So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.
Job|7|10|He shall return no more to his house,                   Neither shall his place know him any more.
Job|7|11|Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;                   I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;                   I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job|7|12|Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,                   That thou settest a watch over me?
Job|7|13|When I say, My bed shall comfort me,                   My couch shall ease my complaint;
Job|7|14|Then thou scarest me with dreams,                   And terrifiest me through visions:
Job|7|15|So that my soul chooseth strangling,                   And death rather than {these} my bones.
Job|7|16|I loathe {my life}; I would not live alway:                   Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job|7|17|What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,                   And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,
Job|7|18|And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,                   And try him every moment?
Job|7|19|How long wilt thou not look away from me,                   Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
Job|7|20|If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men?                   Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,                   So that I am a burden to myself?
Job|7|21|And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?                   For now shall I lie down in the dust;                   And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
Job|8|1|Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|8|2|How long wilt thou speak these things?                   And {how long} shall the words of thy mouth be {like} a mighty wind?
Job|8|3|Doth God pervert justice?                   Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job|8|4|If thy children have sinned against him,                   And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;
Job|8|5|If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,                   And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
Job|8|6|If thou wert pure and upright:                   Surely now he would awake for thee,                   And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
Job|8|7|And though thy beginning was small,                   Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
Job|8|8|For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,                   And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:
Job|8|9|(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,                   Because our days upon earth are a shadow);
Job|8|10|Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,                   And utter words out of their heart?
Job|8|11|Can the rush grow up without mire?                   Can the flag grow without water?
Job|8|12|Whilst it is yet in its greenness, {and} not cut down,                   It withereth before any {other} herb.
Job|8|13|So are the paths of all that forget God;                   And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
