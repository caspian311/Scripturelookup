Matthew|27|7|And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Matthew|27|8|Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day.
Matthew|27|9|Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom {certain} of the children of Israel did price;
Matthew|27|10|and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
Matthew|27|11|Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
Matthew|27|12|And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Matthew|27|13|Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Matthew|27|14|And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Matthew|27|15|Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
Matthew|27|16|And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew|27|17|When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
Matthew|27|18|For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
Matthew|27|19|And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
Matthew|27|20|Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew|27|21|But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
Matthew|27|22|Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|23|And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|24|So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye {to it}.
Matthew|27|25|And all the people answered and said, His blood {be} on us, and on our children.
Matthew|27|26|Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.
Matthew|27|27|Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.
Matthew|27|28|And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew|27|29|And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew|27|30|And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.
Matthew|27|31|And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.
Matthew|27|32|And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go {with them}, that he might bear his cross.
Matthew|27|33|And they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,
Matthew|27|34|they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
Matthew|27|35|And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;
Matthew|27|36|and they sat and watched him there.
Matthew|27|37|And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew|27|38|Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
Matthew|27|39|And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
Matthew|27|40|and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew|27|41|In like manner also the chief priests mocking {him}, with the scribes and elders, said,
Matthew|27|42|He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
Matthew|27|43|He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew|27|44|And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.
Matthew|27|45|Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew|27|46|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew|27|47|And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.
Matthew|27|48|And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
Matthew|27|49|And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.
Matthew|27|50|And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew|27|51|And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;
Matthew|27|52|and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;
Matthew|27|53|and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
Matthew|27|54|Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew|27|55|And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Matthew|27|56|among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew|27|57|And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
Matthew|27|58|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
Matthew|27|59|And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew|27|60|and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
Matthew|27|61|And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew|27|62|Now on the morrow, which is {the day} after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,
Matthew|27|63|saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
Matthew|27|64|Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
Matthew|27|65|Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it {as} sure as ye can.
Matthew|27|66|So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.
Matthew|28|1|Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first {day} of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew|28|2|And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
Matthew|28|3|His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew|28|4|and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.
Matthew|28|5|And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.
Matthew|28|6|He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Matthew|28|7|And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
Matthew|28|8|And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
Matthew|28|9|And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew|28|10|Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
Matthew|28|11|Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.
Matthew|28|12|And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,
Matthew|28|13|saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
Matthew|28|14|And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.
Matthew|28|15|So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, {and continueth} until this day.
Matthew|28|16|But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew|28|17|And when they saw him, they worshipped {him}; but some doubted.
Matthew|28|18|And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.
Matthew|28|19|Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:
Matthew|28|20|teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
Ezekiel|1|1|Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
Ezekiel|1|2|In the fifth {day} of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,
Ezekiel|1|3|the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
Ezekiel|1|4|And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
Ezekiel|1|5|And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
Ezekiel|1|6|And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
Ezekiel|1|7|And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.
Ezekiel|1|8|And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings {thus}:
Ezekiel|1|9|their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel|1|10|As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|1|11|And their faces and their wings were separate above; two {wings} of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|12|And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|13|As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: {the fire} went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
Ezekiel|1|14|And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel|1|15|Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.
Ezekiel|1|16|The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
Ezekiel|1|17|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|18|As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
Ezekiel|1|19|And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
Ezekiel|1|20|Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
