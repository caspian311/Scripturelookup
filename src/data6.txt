Zephaniah|3|5|Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
Zephaniah|3|6|I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|3|7|I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, {according to} all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
Zephaniah|3|8|Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
Zephaniah|3|9|For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.
Zephaniah|3|10|From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
Zephaniah|3|11|In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
Zephaniah|3|12|But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.
Zephaniah|3|13|The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
Zephaniah|3|14|Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
Zephaniah|3|15|Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.
Zephaniah|3|16|In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
Zephaniah|3|17|Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.
Zephaniah|3|18|I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; {to whom} the burden upon her was a reproach.
Zephaniah|3|19|Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.
Zephaniah|3|20|At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.
Ecclesiastes|1|1|The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|2|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|1|3|What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|1|4|One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecclesiastes|1|5|The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.
Ecclesiastes|1|6|The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.
Ecclesiastes|1|7|All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.
Ecclesiastes|1|8|All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter {it}: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes|1|9|That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|1|10|Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
Ecclesiastes|1|11|There is no remembrance of the former {generations}; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter {generations} that are to come, among those that shall come after.
Ecclesiastes|1|12|I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|13|And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|1|14|I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|15|That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecclesiastes|1|16|I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
Ecclesiastes|1|17|And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|18|For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
Ecclesiastes|2|1|I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|2|I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?
Ecclesiastes|2|3|I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding {me} with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
Ecclesiastes|2|4|I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
Ecclesiastes|2|5|I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;
Ecclesiastes|2|6|I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;
Ecclesiastes|2|7|I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;
Ecclesiastes|2|8|I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
Ecclesiastes|2|9|So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
Ecclesiastes|2|10|And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.
Ecclesiastes|2|11|Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|12|And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what {can} the man {do} that cometh after the king? {even} that which hath been done long ago.
Ecclesiastes|2|13|Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
Ecclesiastes|2|14|The wise manâ€™s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes|2|15|Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|16|For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!
Ecclesiastes|2|17|So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|2|18|And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
Ecclesiastes|2|19|And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|20|Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|21|For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes|2|22|For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|2|23|For all his days are {but} sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|24|There is nothing better for a man {than} that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes|2|25|For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
Ecclesiastes|2|26|For to the man that pleaseth him {God} giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|3|1|For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
Ecclesiastes|3|2|a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
Ecclesiastes|3|3|a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
Ecclesiastes|3|4|a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
Ecclesiastes|3|5|a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
Ecclesiastes|3|6|a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
Ecclesiastes|3|7|a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
Ecclesiastes|3|8|a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes|3|9|What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
Ecclesiastes|3|10|I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|3|11|He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.
Ecclesiastes|3|12|I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.
Ecclesiastes|3|13|And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes|3|14|I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.
Ecclesiastes|3|15|That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.
Ecclesiastes|3|16|And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
Ecclesiastes|3|17|I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes|3|18|I said in my heart, {It is} because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are {but as} beasts.
Ecclesiastes|3|19|For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|3|20|All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes|3|21|Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes|3|22|Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him {back} to see what shall be after him?
Ecclesiastes|4|1|Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
Ecclesiastes|4|2|Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;
Ecclesiastes|4|3|yea, better than them both {did I esteem} him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|4|Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|5|The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes|4|6|Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|7|Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|8|There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, {saith he}, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
Ecclesiastes|4|9|Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
Ecclesiastes|4|10|For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.
Ecclesiastes|4|11|Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm {alone}?
Ecclesiastes|4|12|And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes|4|13|Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
Ecclesiastes|4|14|For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.
Ecclesiastes|4|15|I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.
Ecclesiastes|4|16|There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|5|1|Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.
Ecclesiastes|5|2|Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
Ecclesiastes|5|3|For a dream cometh with a multitude of business, and a foolâ€™s voice with a multitude of words.
Ecclesiastes|5|4|When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest.
Ecclesiastes|5|5|Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes|5|6|Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that is was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
Ecclesiastes|5|7|For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.
Ecclesiastes|5|8|If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they.
Ecclesiastes|5|9|Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king {himself} is served by the field.
Ecclesiastes|5|10|He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|5|11|When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding {of them} with his eyes?
Ecclesiastes|5|12|The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
Ecclesiastes|5|13|There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, {namely}, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt:
Ecclesiastes|5|14|and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.
Ecclesiastes|5|15|As he came forth from his motherâ€™s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.
Ecclesiastes|5|16|And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind?
Ecclesiastes|5|17|All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed, and hath sickness and wrath.
Ecclesiastes|5|18|Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion.
Ecclesiastes|5|19|Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes|5|20|For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth {him} in the joy of his heart.
Ecclesiastes|6|1|There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:
Ecclesiastes|6|2|a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
Ecclesiastes|6|3|If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:
Ecclesiastes|6|4|for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;
Ecclesiastes|6|5|moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other:
Ecclesiastes|6|6|yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place?
Ecclesiastes|6|7|All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
Ecclesiastes|6|8|For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? {or} what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?
Ecclesiastes|6|9|Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|6|10|Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is know what man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.
Ecclesiastes|6|11|Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?
Ecclesiastes|6|12|For who knoweth what is good for man in {his} life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|7|1|A {good} name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of oneâ€™s birth.
Ecclesiastes|7|2|It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
Ecclesiastes|7|3|Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.
Ecclesiastes|7|4|The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
Ecclesiastes|7|5|It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes|7|6|For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|7|7|Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.
Ecclesiastes|7|8|Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; {and} the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes|7|9|Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes|7|10|Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
Ecclesiastes|7|11|Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.
Ecclesiastes|7|12|For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.
Ecclesiastes|7|13|Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
Ecclesiastes|7|14|In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything {that shall be} after him.
Ecclesiastes|7|15|All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth {his life} in his evil-doing.
Ecclesiastes|7|16|Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
Ecclesiastes|7|17|Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
Ecclesiastes|7|18|It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.
Ecclesiastes|7|19|Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.
Ecclesiastes|7|20|Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
Ecclesiastes|7|21|Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;
Ecclesiastes|7|22|for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
Ecclesiastes|7|23|All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
Ecclesiastes|7|24|That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?
Ecclesiastes|7|25|I turned about, and my heart {was set} to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason {of things}, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.
Ecclesiastes|7|26|And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, {and} whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
Ecclesiastes|7|27|Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, {laying} one thing to another, to find out the account;
Ecclesiastes|7|28|which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
Ecclesiastes|7|29|Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
Ecclesiastes|8|1|Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A manâ€™s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.
Ecclesiastes|8|2|I {counsel thee}, Keep the kingâ€™s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.
Ecclesiastes|8|3|Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
Ecclesiastes|8|4|For the kingâ€™s word {hath} power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
Ecclesiastes|8|5|Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise manâ€™s heart discerneth time and judgment:
Ecclesiastes|8|6|for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:
Ecclesiastes|8|7|for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?
Ecclesiastes|8|8|There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.
Ecclesiastes|8|9|All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: {there is} a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes|8|10|So I saw the wicked buried, and they came {to the grave}; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|8|11|Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Ecclesiastes|8|12|Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his {days}, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:
Ecclesiastes|8|13|but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong {his} days, {which are} as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
Ecclesiastes|8|14|There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|8|15|Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that shall abide with him in his labor {all} the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|8|16|When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),
Ecclesiastes|8|17|then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
Ecclesiastes|9|1|For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.
Ecclesiastes|9|2|All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; {and} he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
Ecclesiastes|9|3|This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that {they go} to the dead.
Ecclesiastes|9|4|For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes|9|5|For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes|9|6|As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|9|7|Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.
Ecclesiastes|9|8|Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil.
Ecclesiastes|9|9|Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|9|10|Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do {it} with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.
Ecclesiastes|9|11|I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes|9|12|For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
Ecclesiastes|9|13|I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me:
Ecclesiastes|9|14|There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
Ecclesiastes|9|15|Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
Ecclesiastes|9|16|Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor manâ€™s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes|9|17|The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
Ecclesiastes|9|18|Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.
Ecclesiastes|10|1|Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; {so} doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
Ecclesiastes|10|2|A wise manâ€™s heart is at his right hand; but a foolâ€™s heart at his left.
Ecclesiastes|10|3|Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one {that} he is a fool.
Ecclesiastes|10|4|If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.
Ecclesiastes|10|5|There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
Ecclesiastes|10|6|folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
Ecclesiastes|10|7|I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|10|8|He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
Ecclesiastes|10|9|Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; {and} he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
Ecclesiastes|10|10|If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
Ecclesiastes|10|11|If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
Ecclesiastes|10|12|The words of a wise manâ€™s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
Ecclesiastes|10|13|The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
Ecclesiastes|10|14|A fool also multiplieth words: {yet} man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
Ecclesiastes|10|15|The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.
Ecclesiastes|10|16|Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
Ecclesiastes|10|17|Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Ecclesiastes|10|18|By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
Ecclesiastes|10|19|A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.
Ecclesiastes|10|20|Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
Ecclesiastes|11|1|Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes|11|2|Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|11|3|If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
Ecclesiastes|11|4|He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
Ecclesiastes|11|5|As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, {nor} how the bones {do grow} in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.
Ecclesiastes|11|6|In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
Ecclesiastes|11|7|Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
Ecclesiastes|11|8|Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|11|9|Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
Ecclesiastes|11|10|Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
Ecclesiastes|12|1|Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes|12|2|before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
Ecclesiastes|12|3|in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,
Ecclesiastes|12|4|and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
Ecclesiastes|12|5|yea, they shall be afraid of {that which is} high, and terrors {shall be} in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes|12|6|before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
Ecclesiastes|12|7|and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes|12|8|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|12|9|And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, {and} set in order many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes|12|10|The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, {even} words of truth.
Ecclesiastes|12|11|The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are {the words of} the masters of assemblies, {which} are given from one shepherd.
Ecclesiastes|12|12|And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes|12|13|{This is} the end of the matter; all hath been heard: fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole {duty} of man.
Ecclesiastes|12|14|For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
2 Kings|1|1|And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings|1|2|And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.
2 Kings|1|3|But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
2 Kings|1|4|Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
2 Kings|1|5|And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?
2 Kings|1|6|And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
2 Kings|1|7|And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?
2 Kings|1|8|And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
2 Kings|1|9|Then {the king} sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
2 Kings|1|10|And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|11|And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
2 Kings|1|12|And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|13|And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|14|Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|15|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
2 Kings|1|16|And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
2 Kings|1|17|So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings|1|18|Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|2|1|And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
2 Kings|2|2|And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
2 Kings|2|3|And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|4|And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
2 Kings|2|5|And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|6|And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
2 Kings|2|7|And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|8|And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2 Kings|2|9|And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2 Kings|2|10|And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: {nevertheless}, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
2 Kings|2|11|And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, {there appeared} a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2 Kings|2|12|And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!      And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2 Kings|2|13|He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|14|And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.
2 Kings|2|15|And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2 Kings|2|16|And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
2 Kings|2|17|And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2 Kings|2|18|And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2 Kings|2|19|And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.
2 Kings|2|20|And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
2 Kings|2|21|And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.
2 Kings|2|22|So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.
2 Kings|2|23|And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.
2 Kings|2|24|And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.
2 Kings|2|25|And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings|3|1|Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
2 Kings|3|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
2 Kings|3|3|Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2 Kings|3|4|Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.
2 Kings|3|5|But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings|3|6|And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings|3|7|And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
2 Kings|3|8|And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
2 Kings|3|9|So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven daysâ€™ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.
2 Kings|3|10|And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|11|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israelâ€™s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
2 Kings|3|12|And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
2 Kings|3|13|And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|14|And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
2 Kings|3|15|But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.
2 Kings|3|16|And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.
2 Kings|3|17|For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.
2 Kings|3|18|And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings|3|19|And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2 Kings|3|20|And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
2 Kings|3|21|Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.
2 Kings|3|22|And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:
2 Kings|3|23|and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
2 Kings|3|24|And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.
2 Kings|3|25|And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir-hareseth {only} they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
2 Kings|3|26|And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.
2 Kings|3|27|Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
2 Kings|4|1|Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.
2 Kings|4|2|And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.
2 Kings|4|3|Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
2 Kings|4|4|And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
2 Kings|4|5|So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they brought {the vessels} to her, and she poured out.
2 Kings|4|6|And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
2 Kings|4|7|Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy sons of the rest.
2 Kings|4|8|And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
2 Kings|4|9|And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.
2 Kings|4|10|Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
2 Kings|4|11|And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.
2 Kings|4|12|And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
2 Kings|4|13|And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
2 Kings|4|14|And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.
2 Kings|4|15|And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
2 Kings|4|16|And he said, At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thy handmaid.
2 Kings|4|17|And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.
2 Kings|4|18|And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
2 Kings|4|19|And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.
2 Kings|4|20|And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
2 Kings|4|21|And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut {the door} upon him, and went out.
2 Kings|4|22|And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
2 Kings|4|23|And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
2 Kings|4|24|Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.
2 Kings|4|25|So she went, and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel.      And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:
2 Kings|4|26|run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.
2 Kings|4|27|And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
2 Kings|4|28|Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
2 Kings|4|29|Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
2 Kings|4|30|And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
2 Kings|4|31|And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
2 Kings|4|32|And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
2 Kings|4|33|He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.
2 Kings|4|34|And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
2 Kings|4|35|Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
2 Kings|4|36|And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
2 Kings|4|37|Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.
2 Kings|4|38|And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
2 Kings|4|39|And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.
2 Kings|4|40|So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
2 Kings|4|41|But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
2 Kings|4|42|And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
2 Kings|4|43|And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
2 Kings|4|44|So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|5|1|Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him Jehovah had given victory unto Syria: he was also a mighty man of valor, {but he was} a leper.
2 Kings|5|2|And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naamanâ€™s wife.
2 Kings|5|3|And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.
2 Kings|5|4|And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.
2 Kings|5|5|And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand {pieces} of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
2 Kings|5|6|And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
2 Kings|5|7|And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
2 Kings|5|8|And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2 Kings|5|9|So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
2 Kings|5|10|And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
2 Kings|5|11|But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
2 Kings|5|12|Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
2 Kings|5|13|And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
2 Kings|5|14|Then went he down, and dipped {himself} seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2 Kings|5|15|And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.
2 Kings|5|16|But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
2 Kings|5|17|And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mulesâ€™ burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.
2 Kings|5|18|In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.
2 Kings|5|19|And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
2 Kings|5|20|But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
2 Kings|5|21|So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
2 Kings|5|22|And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
2 Kings|5|23|And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
2 Kings|5|24|And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.
2 Kings|5|25|But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
2 Kings|5|26|And he said unto him, Went not my heart {with thee}, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?
2 Kings|5|27|The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper {as white} as snow.
2 Kings|6|1|And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.
2 Kings|6|2|Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
2 Kings|6|3|And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
2 Kings|6|4|So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.
2 Kings|6|5|But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.
2 Kings|6|6|And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim.
2 Kings|6|7|And he said, Take it up to thee. So he put out his hand, and took it.
2 Kings|6|8|Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
2 Kings|6|9|And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down.
2 Kings|6|10|And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.
2 Kings|6|11|And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
2 Kings|6|12|And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
2 Kings|6|13|And he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
2 Kings|6|14|Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
2 Kings|6|15|And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
2 Kings|6|16|And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.
2 Kings|6|17|And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
2 Kings|6|18|And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
2 Kings|6|19|And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.
2 Kings|6|20|And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
2 Kings|6|21|And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
2 Kings|6|22|And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
2 Kings|6|23|And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2 Kings|6|24|And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
2 Kings|6|25|And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an assâ€™s head was sold for fourscore {pieces} of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of doveâ€™s dung for five {pieces} of silver.
2 Kings|6|26|And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
2 Kings|6|27|And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?
2 Kings|6|28|And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
2 Kings|6|29|So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.
2 Kings|6|30|And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
2 Kings|6|31|Then he said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
2 Kings|6|32|But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and {the king} sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his masterâ€™s feet behind him?
2 Kings|6|33|And while he was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?
2 Kings|7|1|And Elisha said, Hear ye the word of Jehovah: thus saith Jehovah, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be {sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
2 Kings|7|2|Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
2 Kings|7|3|Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
2 Kings|7|4|If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
2 Kings|7|5|And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.
2 Kings|7|6|For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
2 Kings|7|7|Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
2 Kings|7|8|And when these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
2 Kings|7|9|Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the kingâ€™s household.
2 Kings|7|10|So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.
2 Kings|7|11|And he called the porters; and they told it to the kingâ€™s household within.
2 Kings|7|12|And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
2 Kings|7|13|And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed); and let us send and see.
2 Kings|7|14|They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
2 Kings|7|15|And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
2 Kings|7|16|And the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was {sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|7|17|And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
2 Kings|7|18|And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;
2 Kings|7|19|and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof:
2 Kings|7|20|it came to pass even so unto him; for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.
2 Kings|8|1|Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
2 Kings|8|2|And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2 Kings|8|3|And it came to pass at the seven yearsâ€™ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
2 Kings|8|4|Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
2 Kings|8|5|And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
2 Kings|8|6|And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
2 Kings|8|7|And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
2 Kings|8|8|And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
2 Kings|8|9|So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camelsâ€™ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
2 Kings|8|10|And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit Jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die.
2 Kings|8|11|And he settled his countenance stedfastly {upon him}, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
2 Kings|8|12|And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.
2 Kings|8|13|And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.
2 Kings|8|14|Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.
2 Kings|8|15|And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|8|16|And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|8|17|Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings|8|18|And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Kings|8|19|Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servantâ€™s sake, as he promised him to give unto him a lamp for his children alway.
2 Kings|8|20|In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
2 Kings|8|21|Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
2 Kings|8|22|So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.
2 Kings|8|23|And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|8|24|And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|8|25|In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
2 Kings|8|26|Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings|8|27|And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
2 Kings|8|28|And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings|8|29|And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2 Kings|9|1|And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings|9|2|And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber.
2 Kings|9|3|Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
2 Kings|9|4|So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings|9|5|And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
2 Kings|9|6|And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.
2 Kings|9|7|And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.
2 Kings|9|8|For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.
2 Kings|9|9|And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings|9|10|And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
2 Kings|9|11|Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.
2 Kings|9|12|And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
2 Kings|9|13|Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is king.
2 Kings|9|14|So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
2 Kings|9|15|but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.
2 Kings|9|16|So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
2 Kings|9|17|Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
2 Kings|9|18|So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.
2 Kings|9|19|Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
2 Kings|9|20|And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
2 Kings|9|21|And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings|9|22|And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
2 Kings|9|23|And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
2 Kings|9|24|And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
2 Kings|9|25|Then said {Jehu} to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:
2 Kings|9|26|Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith Jehovah; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith Jehovah. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat {of ground}, according to the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|9|27|But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden-house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot: {and they smote him} at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
2 Kings|9|28|And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings|9|29|And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
2 Kings|9|30|And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.
2 Kings|9|31|And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy masterâ€™s murderer?
2 Kings|9|32|And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
2 Kings|9|33|And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.
2 Kings|9|34|And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a kingâ€™s daughter.
2 Kings|9|35|And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings|9|36|Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;
2 Kings|9|37|and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
2 Kings|10|1|Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up {the sons of} Ahab, saying,
2 Kings|10|2|And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your masterâ€™s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
2 Kings|10|3|look ye out the best and meetest of your masterâ€™s sons, and set him on his fatherâ€™s throne, and fight for your masterâ€™s house.
2 Kings|10|4|But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
2 Kings|10|5|And he that was over the household, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up {the children}, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
2 Kings|10|6|Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your masterâ€™s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the kingâ€™s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
2 Kings|10|7|And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the kingâ€™s sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.
2 Kings|10|8|And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kingâ€™s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
2 Kings|10|9|And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?
2 Kings|10|10|Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.
2 Kings|10|11|So Jehu smote all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
2 Kings|10|12|And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,
2 Kings|10|13|Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
2 Kings|10|14|And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
2 Kings|10|15|And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
2 Kings|10|16|And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
2 Kings|10|17|And when he came to Samaria, he smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake to Elijah.
2 Kings|10|18|And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.
2 Kings|10|19|Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice {to do} to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings|10|20|And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
2 Kings|10|21|And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.
2 Kings|10|22|And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
2 Kings|10|23|And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.
2 Kings|10|24|And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escape, {he that letteth him go}, his life shall be for the life of him.
2 Kings|10|25|And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
2 Kings|10|26|And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
2 Kings|10|27|And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.
2 Kings|10|28|Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2 Kings|10|29|Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, {to wit}, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.
2 Kings|10|30|And Jehovah said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, {and} hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
2 Kings|10|31|But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|10|32|In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
2 Kings|10|33|from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings|10|34|Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|10|35|And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|10|36|And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
2 Kings|11|1|Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
2 Kings|11|2|But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kingâ€™s sons that were slain, even him and his nurse, {and put them} in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;
2 Kings|11|3|And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings|11|4|And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the kingâ€™s son.
2 Kings|11|5|And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the kingâ€™s house;
2 Kings|11|6|And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
2 Kings|11|7|And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.
2 Kings|11|8|And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he that cometh within the ranks, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he goeth out, and when he cometh in.
2 Kings|11|9|And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings|11|10|And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king Davidâ€™s, which were in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|11|And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
2 Kings|11|12|Then he brought out the kingâ€™s son, and put the crown upon him, and {gave him} the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, {Long} live the king.
2 Kings|11|13|And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard {and of} the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:
2 Kings|11|14|and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!
2 Kings|11|15|And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|16|So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horsesâ€™ entry to the kingâ€™s house: and there was she slain.
2 Kings|11|17|And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovahâ€™s people; between the king also and the people.
2 Kings|11|18|And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|19|And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the kingâ€™s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
2 Kings|11|20|So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the kingâ€™s house.
2 Kings|11|21|Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings|12|1|In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
2 Kings|12|2|And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings|12|3|Howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|12|4|And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any manâ€™s heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,
2 Kings|12|5|let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
2 Kings|12|6|But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
2 Kings|12|7|Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the {other} priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore take no {more} money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
2 Kings|12|8|And the priests consented that they should take no {more} money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.
2 Kings|12|9|But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|10|And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the kingâ€™s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|11|And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,
2 Kings|12|12|and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
2 Kings|12|13|But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;
2 Kings|12|14|for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|15|Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings|12|16|The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Jehovah: it was the priestsâ€™.
2 Kings|12|17|Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
2 Kings|12|18|And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and of the kingâ€™s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings|12|19|Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|12|20|And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and smote Joash at the house of Millo, {on the way} that goeth down to Silla.
2 Kings|12|21|For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|13|1|In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} seventeen years.
2 Kings|13|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2 Kings|13|3|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.
2 Kings|13|4|And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.
2 Kings|13|5|(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.
2 Kings|13|6|Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)
2 Kings|13|7|For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.
2 Kings|13|8|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|13|9|And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|13|10|In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} sixteen years.
2 Kings|13|11|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.
2 Kings|13|12|Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|13|13|And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|13|14|Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!
2 Kings|13|15|And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows.
2 Kings|13|16|And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow; and he put his hand {upon it}. And Elisha laid his hands upon the kingâ€™s hands.
2 Kings|13|17|And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovahâ€™s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
2 Kings|13|18|And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.
2 Kings|13|19|And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times: then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it, whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
2 Kings|13|20|And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2 Kings|13|21|And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
2 Kings|13|22|And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings|13|23|But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
2 Kings|13|24|And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|13|25|And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
2 Kings|14|1|In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|14|2|He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|14|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done.
2 Kings|14|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|14|5|And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father:
2 Kings|14|6|but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Kings|14|7|He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.
2 Kings|14|8|Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Kings|14|9|And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Kings|14|10|Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2 Kings|14|11|But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Kings|14|12|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Kings|14|13|And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Kings|14|14|And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2 Kings|14|15|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|16|And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|14|17|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Kings|14|18|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|14|19|And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Kings|14|20|And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings|14|21|And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2 Kings|14|22|He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2 Kings|14|23|In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, {and reigned} forty and one years.
2 Kings|14|24|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|14|25|He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
2 Kings|14|26|For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.
2 Kings|14|27|And Jehovah said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings|14|28|Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, {which had belonged} to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|29|And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|1|In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|2|Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|15|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Kings|15|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|15|5|And Jehovah smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the kingâ€™s son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
2 Kings|15|6|Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|7|And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|8|In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
2 Kings|15|9|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|10|And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|11|Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|12|This was the word of Jehovah which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass.
2 Kings|15|13|Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|14|And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|15|Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|16|Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
2 Kings|15|17|In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, {and reigned} ten years in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|18|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|19|There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
2 Kings|15|20|And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
2 Kings|15|21|Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|15|22|And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|23|In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} two years.
2 Kings|15|24|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|25|And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the kingâ€™s house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|26|Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|27|In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} twenty years.
2 Kings|15|28|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|29|In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.
2 Kings|15|30|And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
2 Kings|15|31|Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|32|In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|33|Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings|15|34|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings|15|35|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|15|36|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|37|In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings|15|38|And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|16|1|In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|16|2|Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.
2 Kings|16|3|But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|16|4|And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2 Kings|16|5|Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
2 Kings|16|6|At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day.
2 Kings|16|7|So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
2 Kings|16|8|And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|9|And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried {the people of} it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
2 Kings|16|10|And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
2 Kings|16|11|And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.
2 Kings|16|12|And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon.
2 Kings|16|13|And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.
2 Kings|16|14|And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.
2 Kings|16|15|And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the kingâ€™s burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
2 Kings|16|16|Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
2 Kings|16|17|And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.
2 Kings|16|18|And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the kingâ€™s entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|19|Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|16|20|And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|17|1|In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, {and reigned} nine years.
2 Kings|17|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
2 Kings|17|3|Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
2 Kings|17|4|And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
2 Kings|17|5|Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
2 Kings|17|6|In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings|17|7|And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
2 Kings|17|8|and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
2 Kings|17|9|And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Jehovah their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;
2 Kings|17|10|and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree;
2 Kings|17|11|and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Jehovah carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
2 Kings|17|12|and they served idols, whereof Jehovah had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
2 Kings|17|13|Yet Jehovah testified unto Israel, and unto Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
2 Kings|17|14|Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in Jehovah their God.
2 Kings|17|15|And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified unto them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and {went} after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
2 Kings|17|16|And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
2 Kings|17|17|And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Kings|17|18|Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
2 Kings|17|19|Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
2 Kings|17|20|And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
2 Kings|17|21|For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
2 Kings|17|22|And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
2 Kings|17|23|until Jehovah removed Israel out of his sight, as he spake by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
2 Kings|17|24|And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
2 Kings|17|25|And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah: therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
2 Kings|17|26|Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the law of the god of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the law of the god of the land.
2 Kings|17|27|Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.
2 Kings|17|28|So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
2 Kings|17|29|Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
2 Kings|17|30|And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
2 Kings|17|31|and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings|17|32|So they feared Jehovah, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
2 Kings|17|33|They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
2 Kings|17|34|Unto this day they do after the former manner: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
2 Kings|17|35|with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
2 Kings|17|36|but Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:
2 Kings|17|37|and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:
2 Kings|17|38|and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:
2 Kings|17|39|but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
2 Kings|17|40|Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
2 Kings|17|41|So these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their childrenâ€™s children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
2 Kings|18|1|Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|18|2|Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings|18|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
2 Kings|18|4|He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.
2 Kings|18|5|He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor {among them} that were before him.
2 Kings|18|6|For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.
2 Kings|18|7|And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
2 Kings|18|8|He smote the Philistines unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
2 Kings|18|9|And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
2 Kings|18|10|And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
2 Kings|18|11|And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
2 Kings|18|12|because they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
2 Kings|18|13|Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
2 Kings|18|14|And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings|18|15|And Hezekiah gave {him} all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the kingâ€™s house.
2 Kings|18|16|At that time did Hezekiah cut off {the gold from} the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and {from} the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|17|And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fullerâ€™s field.
2 Kings|18|18|And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
2 Kings|18|19|And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
2 Kings|18|20|Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), {There is} counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
2 Kings|18|21|Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
2 Kings|18|22|But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
2 Kings|18|23|Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
2 Kings|18|24|How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masterâ€™s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
2 Kings|18|25|Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
2 Kings|18|26|Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jewsâ€™ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
2 Kings|18|27|But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
2 Kings|18|28|Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewsâ€™ language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|29|Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
2 Kings|18|30|neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|31|Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
2 Kings|18|32|Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
2 Kings|18|33|Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings|18|34|Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
2 Kings|18|35|Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
2 Kings|18|36|But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the kingâ€™s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
2 Kings|18|37|Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
2 Kings|19|1|And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|2|And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
2 Kings|19|3|And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
2 Kings|19|4|It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
2 Kings|19|5|So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings|19|6|And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
2 Kings|19|7|Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2 Kings|19|8|So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
2 Kings|19|9|And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
2 Kings|19|10|Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|19|11|Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
2 Kings|19|12|Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
2 Kings|19|13|Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
2 Kings|19|14|And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|15|And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, that sittest {above} the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
2 Kings|19|16|Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God.
2 Kings|19|17|Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
2 Kings|19|18|and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of menâ€™s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
2 Kings|19|19|Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save thou us, I beseech thee, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou Jehovah art God alone.
2 Kings|19|20|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard {thee}.
2 Kings|19|21|This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
2 Kings|19|22|Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? {even} against the Holy One of Israel.
2 Kings|19|23|By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.
2 Kings|19|24|I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
2 Kings|19|25|Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
2 Kings|19|26|Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.
2 Kings|19|27|But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
2 Kings|19|28|Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
2 Kings|19|29|And this shall be the sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
2 Kings|19|30|And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
2 Kings|19|31|For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.
2 Kings|19|32|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
2 Kings|19|33|By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|34|For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant Davidâ€™s sake.
2 Kings|19|35|And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
2 Kings|19|36|So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
2 Kings|19|37|And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|20|1|In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
2 Kings|20|2|Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
2 Kings|20|3|Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
2 Kings|20|4|And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
2 Kings|20|5|Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|6|And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant Davidâ€™s sake.
2 Kings|20|7|And Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
2 Kings|20|8|And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?
2 Kings|20|9|And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?
2 Kings|20|10|And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.
2 Kings|20|11|And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Jehovah; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
2 Kings|20|12|At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
2 Kings|20|13|And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
2 Kings|20|14|Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
2 Kings|20|15|And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
2 Kings|20|16|And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|17|Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|18|And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
2 Kings|20|19|Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
2 Kings|20|20|Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|20|21|And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|21|1|Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Hephzibah.
2 Kings|21|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|21|3|For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2 Kings|21|4|And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
2 Kings|21|5|And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|6|And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Kings|21|7|And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;
2 Kings|21|8|neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
2 Kings|21|9|But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|21|10|And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
2 Kings|21|11|Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;
2 Kings|21|12|therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
2 Kings|21|13|And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
2 Kings|21|14|And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
2 Kings|21|15|because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
2 Kings|21|16|Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|17|Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|21|18|And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|21|19|Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2 Kings|21|20|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father.
2 Kings|21|21|And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
2 Kings|21|22|and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|23|And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
2 Kings|21|24|But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Kings|21|25|Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|21|26|And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|22|1|Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
2 Kings|22|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Kings|22|3|And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,
2 Kings|22|4|Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:
2 Kings|22|5|and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,
2 Kings|22|6|unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2 Kings|22|7|Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings|22|8|And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
2 Kings|22|9|And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|22|10|And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2 Kings|22|11|And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2 Kings|22|12|And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kingâ€™s servant, saying,
2 Kings|22|13|Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
2 Kings|22|14|So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.
2 Kings|22|15|And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,
2 Kings|22|16|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.
2 Kings|22|17|Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
2 Kings|22|18|But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,
2 Kings|22|19|because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|22|20|Therefore, behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
2 Kings|23|1|And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|23|2|And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|23|3|And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all {his} heart, and all {his} soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.
2 Kings|23|4|And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|5|And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
2 Kings|23|6|And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people.
2 Kings|23|7|And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
2 Kings|23|8|And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a manâ€™s left hand at the gate of the city.
2 Kings|23|9|Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.
2 Kings|23|10|And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
2 Kings|23|11|And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
2 Kings|23|12|And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, did the king break down, and beat {them} down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
2 Kings|23|13|And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
2 Kings|23|14|And he brake in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of men.
2 Kings|23|15|Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
2 Kings|23|16|And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
2 Kings|23|17|Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|18|And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
2 Kings|23|19|And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke {Jehovah} to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|20|And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there, upon the altars, and burned menâ€™s bones upon them; and he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings|23|21|And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
2 Kings|23|22|Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
2 Kings|23|23|but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover kept to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
2 Kings|23|24|Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|23|25|And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to Jehovah with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
2 Kings|23|26|Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him.
2 Kings|23|27|And Jehovah said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
2 Kings|23|28|Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|23|29|In his days Pharaoh-necoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and {Pharaoh-necoh} slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
2 Kings|23|30|And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead.
2 Kings|23|31|Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|23|32|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings|23|33|And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
2 Kings|23|34|And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.
2 Kings|23|35|And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh.
2 Kings|23|36|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2 Kings|23|37|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings|24|1|In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
2 Kings|24|2|And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets.
2 Kings|24|3|Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,
2 Kings|24|4|and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon.
2 Kings|24|5|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|24|6|So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|24|7|And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
2 Kings|24|8|Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his motherâ€™s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|24|9|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.
2 Kings|24|10|At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
2 Kings|24|11|And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;
2 Kings|24|12|and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
2 Kings|24|13|And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.
2 Kings|24|14|And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
2 Kings|24|15|And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the kingâ€™s mother, and the kingâ€™s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|16|And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|17|And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, {Jehoiachinâ€™s} fatherâ€™s brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings|24|18|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|24|19|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings|24|20|For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings|25|1|And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
2 Kings|25|2|So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings|25|3|On the ninth day of the {fourth} month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
2 Kings|25|4|Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war {fled} by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the kingâ€™s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and {the king} went by the way of the Arabah.
2 Kings|25|5|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings|25|6|Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
2 Kings|25|7|And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2 Kings|25|8|Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.
2 Kings|25|9|And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the kingâ€™s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.
2 Kings|25|10|And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were {with} the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
2 Kings|25|11|And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
2 Kings|25|12|But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
2 Kings|25|13|And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
2 Kings|25|14|And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
2 Kings|25|15|And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
2 Kings|25|16|The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
2 Kings|25|17|The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network.
2 Kings|25|18|And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:
2 Kings|25|19|and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the kingâ€™s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.
2 Kings|25|20|And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
2 Kings|25|21|And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
2 Kings|25|22|And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
2 Kings|25|23|Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
2 Kings|25|24|And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
2 Kings|25|25|But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
2 Kings|25|26|And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
2 Kings|25|27|And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
2 Kings|25|28|and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
2 Kings|25|29|and changed his prison garments. And {Jehoiachin} did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:
2 Kings|25|30|and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.
Genesis|1|1|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis|1|2|And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Genesis|1|3|And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis|1|9|And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
Genesis|1|10|And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|11|And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, {and} fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis|1|12|And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|13|And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
Genesis|1|14|And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
Genesis|1|15|and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis|1|16|And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: {he made} the stars also.
Genesis|1|17|And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
Genesis|1|18|and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|19|And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
Genesis|1|20|And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
Genesis|1|21|And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|22|And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
Genesis|1|23|And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
Genesis|1|24|And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.
Genesis|1|25|And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|26|And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Genesis|1|27|And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Genesis|1|28|And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Genesis|1|29|And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:
Genesis|1|30|and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, {I have given} every green herb for food: and it was so.
Genesis|1|31|And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
Genesis|2|1|And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Genesis|2|2|And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis|2|3|And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.
Genesis|2|4|These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
Genesis|2|5|And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;
Genesis|2|6|but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis|2|7|And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Genesis|2|8|And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis|2|9|And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis|2|10|And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
Genesis|2|11|The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
Genesis|2|12|and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
Genesis|2|13|And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
Genesis|2|14|And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis|2|15|And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
Genesis|2|16|And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
Genesis|2|17|but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
Genesis|2|18|And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.
Genesis|2|19|And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
Genesis|2|20|And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.
Genesis|2|21|And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:
Genesis|2|22|and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
Genesis|2|23|And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Genesis|2|24|Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
Genesis|2|25|And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Genesis|3|1|Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?
Genesis|3|2|And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:
Genesis|3|3|but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
Genesis|3|4|And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
Genesis|3|5|for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
Genesis|3|6|And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
Genesis|3|7|And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
Genesis|3|8|And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.
Genesis|3|9|And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?
Genesis|3|10|And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
Genesis|3|11|And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
Genesis|3|12|And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
Genesis|3|13|And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
Genesis|3|14|And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
Genesis|3|15|and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Genesis|3|16|Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
Genesis|3|17|And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
Genesis|3|18|thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
Genesis|3|19|in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
Genesis|3|20|And the man called his wifeâ€™s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Genesis|3|21|And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.
Genesis|3|22|And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for everâ€”
Genesis|3|23|therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
Genesis|3|24|So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Genesis|4|1|And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with {the help of} Jehovah.
Genesis|4|2|And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis|4|3|And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.
Genesis|4|4|And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
Genesis|4|5|but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
Genesis|4|6|And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
Genesis|4|7|If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.
Genesis|4|8|And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
Genesis|4|9|And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brotherâ€™s keeper?
Genesis|4|10|And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brotherâ€™s blood crieth unto me from the ground.
Genesis|4|11|And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brotherâ€™s blood from thy hand;
Genesis|4|12|when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
Genesis|4|13|And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Genesis|4|14|Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.
Genesis|4|15|And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
Genesis|4|16|And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
Genesis|4|17|And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
Genesis|4|18|And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.
Genesis|4|19|And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
Genesis|4|20|And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and {have} cattle.
Genesis|4|21|And his brotherâ€™s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
Genesis|4|22|And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis|4|23|And Lamech said unto his wives:             Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;                   Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech:                   For I have slain a man for wounding me,                   And a young man for bruising me:
Genesis|4|24|If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,                   Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
Genesis|4|25|And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, {said she}, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.
Genesis|4|26|And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|5|1|This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
Genesis|5|2|male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
Genesis|5|3|And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat {a son} in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
Genesis|5|4|and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|5|5|And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
Genesis|5|6|And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:
Genesis|5|7|and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|8|and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
Genesis|5|9|And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.
Genesis|5|10|and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|11|and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
Genesis|5|12|And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:
Genesis|5|13|and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|14|and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
Genesis|5|15|And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
Genesis|5|16|And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|17|and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
Genesis|5|18|And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:
Genesis|5|19|and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|20|And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
Genesis|5|21|And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
Genesis|5|22|and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|23|and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
Genesis|5|24|and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
Genesis|5|25|And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
Genesis|5|26|and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|5|27|And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
Genesis|5|28|And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
Genesis|5|29|and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, {which cometh} because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.
Genesis|5|30|And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|31|And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
Genesis|5|32|And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis|6|1|And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,
Genesis|6|2|that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
Genesis|6|3|And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
Genesis|6|4|The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
Genesis|6|5|And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Genesis|6|6|And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
Genesis|6|7|And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
Genesis|6|8|But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
Genesis|6|9|These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, {and} perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.
Genesis|6|10|And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis|6|11|And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
Genesis|6|12|And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
Genesis|6|13|And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Genesis|6|14|Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
Genesis|6|15|And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
Genesis|6|16|A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
Genesis|6|17|And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.
Genesis|6|18|But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sonsâ€™ wives with thee.
Genesis|6|19|And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Genesis|6|20|Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
Genesis|6|21|And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Genesis|6|22|Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Genesis|7|1|And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
Genesis|7|2|Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:
Genesis|7|3|of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis|7|4|For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.
Genesis|7|5|And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.
Genesis|7|6|And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
Genesis|7|7|And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sonsâ€™ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Genesis|7|8|Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,
Genesis|7|9|there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
Genesis|7|10|And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
Genesis|7|11|In the six hundredth year of Noahâ€™s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
Genesis|7|12|And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis|7|13|In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noahâ€™s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
Genesis|7|14|they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
Genesis|7|15|And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
Genesis|7|16|And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.
Genesis|7|17|And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
Genesis|7|18|And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
Genesis|7|19|And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.
Genesis|7|20|Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Genesis|7|21|And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
Genesis|7|22|all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
Genesis|7|23|And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.
Genesis|7|24|And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
Genesis|8|1|And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;
Genesis|8|2|the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
Genesis|8|3|and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
Genesis|8|4|And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis|8|5|And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
Genesis|8|6|And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
Genesis|8|7|and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
Genesis|8|8|And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
Genesis|8|9|but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.
Genesis|8|10|And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
Genesis|8|11|and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
Genesis|8|12|And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.
Genesis|8|13|And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.
Genesis|8|14|And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
Genesis|8|15|And God spake unto Noah, saying,
Genesis|8|16|Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sonsâ€™ wives with thee.
Genesis|8|17|Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
Genesis|8|18|And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sonsâ€™ wives with him:
Genesis|8|19|every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.
Genesis|8|20|And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
Genesis|8|21|And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for manâ€™s sake, for that the imagination of manâ€™s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.
Genesis|8|22|While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
Genesis|9|1|And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
Genesis|9|2|And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
Genesis|9|3|Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.
Genesis|9|4|But flesh with the life thereof, {which is} the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
Genesis|9|5|And surely your blood, {the blood} of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every manâ€™s brother, will I require the life of man.
Genesis|9|6|Whoso sheddeth manâ€™s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
Genesis|9|7|And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
Genesis|9|8|And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
Genesis|9|9|And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
Genesis|9|10|and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
Genesis|9|11|And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
Genesis|9|12|And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
Genesis|9|13|I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
Genesis|9|14|And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
Genesis|9|15|and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis|9|16|And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis|9|17|And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis|9|18|And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
Genesis|9|19|These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.
Genesis|9|20|And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:
Genesis|9|21|and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent.
Genesis|9|22|And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Genesis|9|23|And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their fatherâ€™s nakedness.
Genesis|9|24|And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
Genesis|9|25|And he said,             Cursed be Canaan;                   A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
Genesis|9|26|And he said,             Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem;                   And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis|9|27|God enlarge Japheth,                   And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;                   And let Canaan be his servant.
Genesis|9|28|And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis|9|29|And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Genesis|10|1|Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, {namely}, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
Genesis|10|2|The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
Genesis|10|3|And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
Genesis|10|4|And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
Genesis|10|5|Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
Genesis|10|6|And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
Genesis|10|7|And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
Genesis|10|8|And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Genesis|10|9|He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
Genesis|10|10|And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Genesis|10|11|Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,
Genesis|10|12|and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
Genesis|10|13|And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
Genesis|10|14|and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
Genesis|10|15|And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
Genesis|10|16|and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
Genesis|10|17|and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
Genesis|10|18|and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
Genesis|10|19|And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
Genesis|10|20|These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
Genesis|10|21|And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
Genesis|10|22|The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
Genesis|10|23|And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
Genesis|10|24|And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
Genesis|10|25|And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brotherâ€™s name was Joktan.
Genesis|10|26|And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
Genesis|10|27|and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
Genesis|10|28|and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
Genesis|10|29|and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis|10|30|And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
Genesis|10|31|These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
Genesis|10|32|These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Genesis|11|1|And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
Genesis|11|2|And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Genesis|11|3|And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
Genesis|11|4|And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top {may reach} unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis|11|5|And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Genesis|11|6|And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
Genesis|11|7|Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one anotherâ€™s speech.
Genesis|11|8|So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
Genesis|11|9|Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis|11|10|These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Genesis|11|11|and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|12|And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.
Genesis|11|13|and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|14|And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
Genesis|11|15|and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|16|And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
Genesis|11|17|and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|18|And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
Genesis|11|19|and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|20|And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
Genesis|11|21|and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|22|And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
Genesis|11|23|and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|24|And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
Genesis|11|25|and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|26|And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Genesis|11|27|Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.
Genesis|11|28|And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis|11|29|And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abramâ€™s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahorâ€™s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Genesis|11|30|And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
Genesis|11|31|And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his sonâ€™s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abramâ€™s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
Genesis|11|32|And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis|12|1|Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fatherâ€™s house, unto the land that I will show thee:
Genesis|12|2|and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing;
Genesis|12|3|and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|12|4|So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis|12|5|And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brotherâ€™s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis|12|6|And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis|12|7|And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.
Genesis|12|8|And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|12|9|And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
Genesis|12|10|And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|12|11|And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis|12|12|and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis|12|13|Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
Genesis|12|14|And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Genesis|12|15|And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaohâ€™s house.
Genesis|12|16|And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
Genesis|12|17|And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abramâ€™s wife.
Genesis|12|18|And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Genesis|12|19|why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Genesis|12|20|And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
Genesis|13|1|And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
Genesis|13|2|And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis|13|3|And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,
Genesis|13|4|unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|13|5|And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis|13|6|And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis|13|7|And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abramâ€™s cattle and the herdsmen of Lotâ€™s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
Genesis|13|8|And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.
Genesis|13|9|Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If {thou wilt take} the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if {thou take} the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Genesis|13|10|And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.
Genesis|13|11|So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis|13|12|Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis|13|13|Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.
Genesis|13|14|And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
Genesis|13|15|for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Genesis|13|16|And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
Genesis|13|17|Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
Genesis|13|18|And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.
Genesis|14|1|And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis|14|2|that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
Genesis|14|3|All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
Genesis|14|4|Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis|14|5|And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis|14|6|and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
Genesis|14|7|And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis|14|8|And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis|14|9|against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Genesis|14|10|Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis|14|11|And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis|14|12|And they took Lot, Abramâ€™s brotherâ€™s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Genesis|14|13|And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
Genesis|14|14|And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
Genesis|14|15|And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis|14|16|And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Genesis|14|17|And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the Kingâ€™s Vale).
Genesis|14|18|And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
Genesis|14|19|And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis|14|20|and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
Genesis|14|21|And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis|14|22|And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis|14|23|that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis|14|24|save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.
Genesis|15|1|After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.
Genesis|15|2|And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
Genesis|15|3|And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis|15|4|And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Genesis|15|5|And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Genesis|15|6|And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
Genesis|15|7|And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Genesis|15|8|And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis|15|9|And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
Genesis|15|10|And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis|15|11|And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
Genesis|15|12|And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis|15|13|And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Genesis|15|14|and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Genesis|15|15|But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis|15|16|And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
Genesis|15|17|And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
Genesis|15|18|In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis|15|19|the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
Genesis|15|20|and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
Genesis|15|21|and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
Genesis|16|1|Now Sarai, Abramâ€™s wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Genesis|16|2|And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis|16|3|And Sarai, Abramâ€™s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
Genesis|16|4|And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis|16|5|And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee.
Genesis|16|6|But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.
Genesis|16|7|And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis|16|8|And he said, Hagar, Saraiâ€™s handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Genesis|16|9|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Genesis|16|10|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis|16|11|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis|16|12|And he shall be {as} a wild ass among men; his hand {shall be} against every man, and every manâ€™s hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.
Genesis|16|13|And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis|16|14|Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis|16|15|And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis|16|16|And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis|17|1|And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Genesis|17|2|And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Genesis|17|3|And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis|17|4|As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis|17|5|Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
Genesis|17|6|And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Genesis|17|7|And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
Genesis|17|8|And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Genesis|17|9|And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
Genesis|17|10|This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis|17|11|And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis|17|12|And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
Genesis|17|13|He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis|17|14|And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
Genesis|17|15|And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Genesis|17|16|And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be {a mother of} nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
Genesis|17|17|Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Genesis|17|18|And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
Genesis|17|19|And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
Genesis|17|20|And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis|17|21|But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
Genesis|17|22|And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis|17|23|And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abrahamâ€™s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Genesis|17|24|And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|25|And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|26|In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis|17|27|And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Genesis|18|1|And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis|18|2|and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
Genesis|18|3|and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis|18|4|let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis|18|5|and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Genesis|18|6|And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
Genesis|18|7|And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis|18|8|And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Genesis|18|9|And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Genesis|18|10|And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis|18|11|Now Abraham and Sarah were old, {and} well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis|18|12|And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis|18|13|And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?
Genesis|18|14|Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
Genesis|18|15|Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Genesis|18|16|And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis|18|17|And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;
Genesis|18|18|seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Genesis|18|19|For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
Genesis|18|20|And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
Genesis|18|21|I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
Genesis|18|22|And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.
Genesis|18|23|And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis|18|24|Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Genesis|18|25|That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
Genesis|18|26|And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
Genesis|18|27|And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:
Genesis|18|28|peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
Genesis|18|29|And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the fortyâ€™s sake.
Genesis|18|30|And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Genesis|18|31|And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twentyâ€™s sake.
Genesis|18|32|And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the tenâ€™s sake.
Genesis|18|33|And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
Genesis|19|1|And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;
Genesis|19|2|and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servantâ€™s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
Genesis|19|3|And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Genesis|19|4|But before they lay down, the men of the city, {even} the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
Genesis|19|5|and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Genesis|19|6|And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.
Genesis|19|7|And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
Genesis|19|8|Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.
Genesis|19|9|And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
Genesis|19|10|But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Genesis|19|11|And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Genesis|19|12|And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:
Genesis|19|13|for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.
Genesis|19|14|And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
Genesis|19|15|And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
Genesis|19|16|But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Genesis|19|17|And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
Genesis|19|18|And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:
Genesis|19|19|behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:
Genesis|19|20|behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.
Genesis|19|21|And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
Genesis|19|22|Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
Genesis|19|23|The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
Genesis|19|24|Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;
Genesis|19|25|and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Genesis|19|26|But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis|19|27|And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:
Genesis|19|28|and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
Genesis|19|29|And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
Genesis|19|30|And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis|19|31|And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Genesis|19|32|come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis|19|33|And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis|19|34|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis|19|35|And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis|19|36|Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis|19|37|And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Genesis|19|38|And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Genesis|20|1|And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis|20|2|And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Genesis|20|3|But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a manâ€™s wife.
Genesis|20|4|Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
Genesis|20|5|Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
Genesis|20|6|And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Genesis|20|7|Now therefore restore the manâ€™s wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
Genesis|20|8|And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid.
Genesis|20|9|Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
Genesis|20|10|And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
Genesis|20|11|And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wifeâ€™s sake.
Genesis|20|12|And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:
Genesis|20|13|and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my fatherâ€™s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
Genesis|20|14|And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Genesis|20|15|And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee.
Genesis|20|16|And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted.
Genesis|20|17|And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children.
Genesis|20|18|For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abrahamâ€™s wife.
Genesis|21|1|And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Genesis|21|2|And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis|21|3|And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Genesis|21|4|And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis|21|5|And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Genesis|21|6|And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.
Genesis|21|7|And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.
Genesis|21|8|And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis|21|9|And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
Genesis|21|10|Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
Genesis|21|11|And the thing was very grievous in Abrahamâ€™s sight on account of his son.
Genesis|21|12|And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Genesis|21|13|And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
Genesis|21|14|And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and {gave her} the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
Genesis|21|15|And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Genesis|21|16|And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
Genesis|21|17|And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Genesis|21|18|Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation.
Genesis|21|19|And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Genesis|21|20|And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
Genesis|21|21|And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Genesis|21|22|And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
Genesis|21|23|Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my sonâ€™s son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
Genesis|21|24|And Abraham said, I will swear.
Genesis|21|25|And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelechâ€™s servants had violently taken away.
Genesis|21|26|And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.
Genesis|21|27|And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant.
Genesis|21|28|And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis|21|29|And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
Genesis|21|30|And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Genesis|21|31|Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them.
Genesis|21|32|So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Genesis|21|33|And {Abraham} planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.
Genesis|21|34|And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
Genesis|22|1|And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis|22|2|And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
Genesis|22|3|And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Genesis|22|4|On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
Genesis|22|5|And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
Genesis|22|6|And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.
Genesis|22|7|And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?
Genesis|22|8|And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together.
Genesis|22|9|And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
Genesis|22|10|And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis|22|11|And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.
Genesis|22|12|And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
Genesis|22|13|And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind {him} a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
Genesis|22|14|And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.
Genesis|22|15|And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,
Genesis|22|16|and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
Genesis|22|17|that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.
Genesis|22|18|And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Genesis|22|19|So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
Genesis|22|20|And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor.
Genesis|22|21|Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.
Genesis|22|22|And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
Genesis|22|23|And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abrahamâ€™s brother.
Genesis|22|24|And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
Genesis|23|1|And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis|23|2|And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
Genesis|23|3|And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,
Genesis|23|4|I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Genesis|23|5|And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis|23|6|Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
Genesis|23|7|And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
Genesis|23|8|And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
Genesis|23|9|that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.
Genesis|23|10|Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Genesis|23|11|Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead.
Genesis|23|12|And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
Genesis|23|13|And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
Genesis|23|14|And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis|23|15|My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.
Genesis|23|16|And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current {money} with the merchant.
Genesis|23|17|So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure
Genesis|23|18|unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
Genesis|23|19|And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|23|20|And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.
Genesis|24|1|And Abraham was old, {and} well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.
Genesis|24|2|And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.
Genesis|24|3|And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
Genesis|24|4|But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Genesis|24|5|And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
Genesis|24|6|And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
Genesis|24|7|Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my fatherâ€™s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
Genesis|24|8|And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
Genesis|24|9|And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.
Genesis|24|10|And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his masterâ€™s in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
Genesis|24|11|And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
Genesis|24|12|And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
Genesis|24|13|Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
Genesis|24|14|And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.
Genesis|24|15|And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abrahamâ€™s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
Genesis|24|16|And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
Genesis|24|17|And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
Genesis|24|18|And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
Genesis|24|19|And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
Genesis|24|20|And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
Genesis|24|21|And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.
Genesis|24|22|And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
Genesis|24|23|and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy fatherâ€™s house for us to lodge in?
Genesis|24|24|And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.
Genesis|24|25|She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
Genesis|24|26|And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.
Genesis|24|27|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my masterâ€™s brethren.
Genesis|24|28|And the damsel ran, and told her motherâ€™s house according to these words.
Genesis|24|29|And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.
Genesis|24|30|And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sisterâ€™s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
Genesis|24|31|And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
Genesis|24|32|And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
Genesis|24|33|And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
Genesis|24|34|And he said, I am Abrahamâ€™s servant.
Genesis|24|35|And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.
Genesis|24|36|And Sarah my masterâ€™s wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath.
Genesis|24|37|And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.
Genesis|24|38|But thou shalt go unto my fatherâ€™s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
Genesis|24|39|And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
Genesis|24|40|And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my fatherâ€™s house.
Genesis|24|41|Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
Genesis|24|42|And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go.
Genesis|24|43|Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink.
Genesis|24|44|And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my masterâ€™s son.
Genesis|24|45|And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
Genesis|24|46|And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
Genesis|24|47|And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahorâ€™s son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
Genesis|24|48|And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my masterâ€™s brotherâ€™s daughter for his son.
Genesis|24|49|And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Genesis|24|50|Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Genesis|24|51|Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy masterâ€™s sonâ€™s wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Genesis|24|52|And it came to pass, that, when Abrahamâ€™s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.
Genesis|24|53|And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
Genesis|24|54|And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
Genesis|24|55|And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us {a few} days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.
Genesis|24|56|And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
Genesis|24|57|And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
Genesis|24|58|And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Genesis|24|59|And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abrahamâ€™s servant, and his men.
Genesis|24|60|And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou {the mother} of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.
Genesis|24|61|And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
Genesis|24|62|And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.
Genesis|24|63|And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
Genesis|24|64|And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
Genesis|24|65|And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.
Genesis|24|66|And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis|24|67|And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarahâ€™s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his motherâ€™s death.
Genesis|25|1|And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
Genesis|25|2|And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
Genesis|25|3|And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
Genesis|25|4|And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Genesis|25|5|And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Genesis|25|6|But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
Genesis|25|7|And these are the days of the years of Abrahamâ€™s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Genesis|25|8|And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis|25|9|And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
Genesis|25|10|The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
Genesis|25|11|And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
Genesis|25|12|Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abrahamâ€™s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarahâ€™s handmaid, bare unto Abraham.
Genesis|25|13|And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
Genesis|25|14|and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Genesis|25|15|Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
Genesis|25|16|These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.
Genesis|25|17|And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis|25|18|And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren.
Genesis|25|19|And these are the generations of Isaac, Abrahamâ€™s son. Abraham begat Isaac.
Genesis|25|20|And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
Genesis|25|21|And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis|25|22|And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
Genesis|25|23|And Jehovah said unto her,             Two nations are in thy womb,                   And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels.                   And the one people shall be stronger than the other people.                   And the elder shall serve the younger.
Genesis|25|24|And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis|25|25|And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.
Genesis|25|26|And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esauâ€™s heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
Genesis|25|27|And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
Genesis|25|28|Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis|25|29|And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
Genesis|25|30|And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
Genesis|25|31|And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.
Genesis|25|32|And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?
Genesis|25|33|And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Genesis|25|34|And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
Genesis|26|1|And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
Genesis|26|2|And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
Genesis|26|3|Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.
Genesis|26|4|And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|26|5|Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Genesis|26|6|And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
Genesis|26|7|And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, {said he}, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon.
Genesis|26|8|And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
Genesis|26|9|And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
Genesis|26|10|And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
Genesis|26|11|And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Genesis|26|12|And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.
Genesis|26|13|And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
Genesis|26|14|And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.
Genesis|26|15|Now all the wells which his fatherâ€™s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
Genesis|26|16|And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we.
Genesis|26|17|And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
Genesis|26|18|And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
Genesis|26|19|And Isaacâ€™s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
Genesis|26|20|And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaacâ€™s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Genesis|26|21|And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
Genesis|26|22|And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Genesis|26|23|And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
Genesis|26|24|And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abrahamâ€™s sake.
Genesis|26|25|And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaacâ€™s servants digged a well.
Genesis|26|26|Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
Genesis|26|27|And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
Genesis|26|28|And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
Genesis|26|29|that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.
Genesis|26|30|And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
Genesis|26|31|And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis|26|32|And it came to pass the same day, that Isaacâ€™s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
Genesis|26|33|And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
Genesis|26|34|And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
Genesis|26|35|And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Genesis|27|1|And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I.
Genesis|27|2|And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
Genesis|27|3|Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
Genesis|27|4|And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die.
Genesis|27|5|And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Genesis|27|6|And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Genesis|27|7|Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.
Genesis|27|8|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Genesis|27|9|Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth.
Genesis|27|10|And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
Genesis|27|11|And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Genesis|27|12|My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
Genesis|27|13|And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
Genesis|27|14|And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
Genesis|27|15|And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
Genesis|27|16|And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.
Genesis|27|17|And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
Genesis|27|18|And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?
Genesis|27|19|And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis|27|20|And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.
Genesis|27|21|And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
Genesis|27|22|And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacobâ€™s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Genesis|27|23|And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esauâ€™s hands. So he blessed him.
Genesis|27|24|And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
Genesis|27|25|And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my sonâ€™s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank.
Genesis|27|26|And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
Genesis|27|27|And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said,             See, the smell of my son                   Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed.
Genesis|27|28|And God give thee of the dew of heaven,                   And of the fatness of the earth,                   And plenty of grain and new wine.
Genesis|27|29|Let peoples serve thee,                   And nations bow down to thee.                   Be lord over thy brethren,                   And let thy motherâ€™s sons bow down to thee.                   Cursed be every one that curseth thee,                   And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.
Genesis|27|30|And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis|27|31|And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his sonâ€™s venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis|27|32|And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.
Genesis|27|33|And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, {and} he shall be blessed.
Genesis|27|34|When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
Genesis|27|35|And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.
Genesis|27|36|And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
Genesis|27|37|And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?
Genesis|27|38|And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis|27|39|And Isaac his father answered and said unto him,             Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling,                   And of the dew of heaven from above.
Genesis|27|40|And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother.                   And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose,                   That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.
Genesis|27|41|And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob.
Genesis|27|42|And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, {purposing} to kill thee.
Genesis|27|43|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.
Genesis|27|44|And tarry with him a few days, until thy brotherâ€™s fury turn away.
Genesis|27|45|Until thy brotherâ€™s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
Genesis|27|46|And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
Genesis|28|1|And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis|28|2|Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy motherâ€™s father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy motherâ€™s brother.
Genesis|28|3|And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples.
Genesis|28|4|And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.
Genesis|28|5|And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacobâ€™s and Esauâ€™s mother.
Genesis|28|6|Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis|28|7|And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis|28|8|And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.
Genesis|28|9|And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahamâ€™s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
Genesis|28|10|And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
Genesis|28|11|And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
Genesis|28|12|And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Genesis|28|13|And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
Genesis|28|14|And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|28|15|And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
Genesis|28|16|And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not.
Genesis|28|17|And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
Genesis|28|18|And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
Genesis|28|19|And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first.
Genesis|28|20|And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Genesis|28|21|so that I come again to my fatherâ€™s house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,
Genesis|28|22|then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be Godâ€™s house. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Genesis|29|1|Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
Genesis|29|2|And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the wellâ€™s mouth was great.
Genesis|29|3|And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the wellâ€™s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the wellâ€™s mouth in its place.
Genesis|29|4|And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
Genesis|29|5|And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
Genesis|29|6|And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
Genesis|29|7|And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
Genesis|29|8|And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the wellâ€™s mouth. Then we water the sheep.
Genesis|29|9|While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her fatherâ€™s sheep. For she kept them.
Genesis|29|10|And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his motherâ€™s brother, and the sheep of Laban his motherâ€™s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the wellâ€™s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his motherâ€™s brother.
Genesis|29|11|And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis|29|12|And Jacob told Rachel that he was her fatherâ€™s brother, and that he was Rebekahâ€™s son. And she ran and told her father.
Genesis|29|13|And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisterâ€™s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
Genesis|29|14|And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
Genesis|29|15|And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?
Genesis|29|16|And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis|29|17|And Leahâ€™s eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
Genesis|29|18|And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
Genesis|29|19|And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.
Genesis|29|20|And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
Genesis|29|21|And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
Genesis|29|22|And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
Genesis|29|23|And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her.
Genesis|29|24|And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
Genesis|29|25|And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
Genesis|29|26|And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.
Genesis|29|27|Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
Genesis|29|28|And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
Genesis|29|29|And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
Genesis|29|30|And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
Genesis|29|31|And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.
Genesis|29|32|And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me.
Genesis|29|33|And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this {son} also. And she called his name Simeon.
Genesis|29|34|And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.
Genesis|29|35|And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.
Genesis|30|1|And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
Genesis|30|2|And Jacobâ€™s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in Godâ€™s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
Genesis|30|3|And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.
Genesis|30|4|And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
Genesis|30|5|And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
Genesis|30|6|And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
Genesis|30|7|And Bilhah Rachelâ€™s handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis|30|8|And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
Genesis|30|9|When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.
Genesis|30|10|And Zilpah Leahâ€™s handmaid bare Jacob a son.
Genesis|30|11|And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.
Genesis|30|12|And Zilpah Leahâ€™s handmaid bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis|30|13|And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.
Genesis|30|14|And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy sonâ€™s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|15|And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my sonâ€™s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy sonâ€™s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|16|And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my sonâ€™s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
Genesis|30|17|And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
Genesis|30|18|And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
Genesis|30|19|And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis|30|20|And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
Genesis|30|21|And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
Genesis|30|22|And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
Genesis|30|23|And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
Genesis|30|24|and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.
Genesis|30|25|And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis|30|26|Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.
Genesis|30|27|And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, {tarry}: {for} I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.
Genesis|30|28|And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
Genesis|30|29|And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
Genesis|30|30|For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
Genesis|30|31|And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
Genesis|30|32|I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and {of such} shall be my hire.
Genesis|30|33|So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that {if found} with me, shall be counted stolen.
Genesis|30|34|And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
Genesis|30|35|And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
Genesis|30|36|and he set three daysâ€™ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Labanâ€™s flocks.
Genesis|30|37|And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
Genesis|30|38|And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
Genesis|30|39|And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis|30|40|And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Labanâ€™s flock.
Genesis|30|41|And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
Genesis|30|42|but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Labanâ€™s, and the stronger Jacobâ€™s.
Genesis|30|43|And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.
Genesis|31|1|And he heard the words of Labanâ€™s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our fatherâ€™s; and of that which was our fatherâ€™s hath he gotten all this glory.
Genesis|31|2|And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
Genesis|31|3|And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
Genesis|31|4|And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
Genesis|31|5|and said unto them, I see your fatherâ€™s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Genesis|31|6|And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis|31|7|And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Genesis|31|8|If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
Genesis|31|9|Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
Genesis|31|10|And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
Genesis|31|11|And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
Genesis|31|12|And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Genesis|31|13|I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
Genesis|31|14|And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fatherâ€™s house?
Genesis|31|15|Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
Genesis|31|16|For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our childrenâ€™s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
Genesis|31|17|Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
Genesis|31|18|and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
Genesis|31|19|Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her fatherâ€™s.
Genesis|31|20|And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
Genesis|31|21|So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|22|And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Genesis|31|23|And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven daysâ€™ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|24|And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|25|And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|26|And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
Genesis|31|27|Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
Genesis|31|28|and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
Genesis|31|29|It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|30|And now, {though} thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy fatherâ€™s house, {yet} wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
Genesis|31|31|And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
Genesis|31|32|With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis|31|33|And Laban went into Jacobâ€™s tent, and into Leahâ€™s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leahâ€™s tent, and entered into Rachelâ€™s tent.
Genesis|31|34|Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camelâ€™s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
Genesis|31|35|And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
Genesis|31|36|And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Genesis|31|37|Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
Genesis|31|38|These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
Genesis|31|39|That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis|31|40|Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
Genesis|31|41|These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Genesis|31|42|Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
Genesis|31|43|And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?
Genesis|31|44|And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
Genesis|31|45|And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Genesis|31|46|And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
Genesis|31|47|And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis|31|48|And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
Genesis|31|49|and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
Genesis|31|50|If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|51|And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|52|This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Genesis|31|53|The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis|31|54|And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
Genesis|31|55|And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place.
Genesis|32|1|And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Genesis|32|2|And Jacob said when he saw them, This is Godâ€™s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Genesis|32|3|And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Genesis|32|4|And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
Genesis|32|5|and I have oxen, and asses, {and} flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
Genesis|32|6|And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Genesis|32|7|Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
Genesis|32|8|and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
Genesis|32|9|And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
Genesis|32|10|I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
Genesis|32|11|Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
Genesis|32|12|And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Genesis|32|13|And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
Genesis|32|14|two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis|32|15|thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
Genesis|32|16|And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Genesis|32|17|And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
Genesis|32|18|then thou shalt say {They are} thy servant Jacobâ€™s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
Genesis|32|19|And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
Genesis|32|20|and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
Genesis|32|21|So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
Genesis|32|22|And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
Genesis|32|23|And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
Genesis|32|24|And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis|32|25|And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacobâ€™s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
Genesis|32|26|And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Genesis|32|27|And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
Genesis|32|28|And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
Genesis|32|29|And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
Genesis|32|30|And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, {said he}, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
Genesis|32|31|And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
Genesis|32|32|Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacobâ€™s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
Genesis|33|1|And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
Genesis|33|2|And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
Genesis|33|3|And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis|33|4|And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
Genesis|33|5|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
Genesis|33|6|Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|7|And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|8|And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|9|And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
Genesis|33|10|And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Genesis|33|11|Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
Genesis|33|12|And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
Genesis|33|13|And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis|33|14|Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
Genesis|33|15|And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|16|So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Genesis|33|17|And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Genesis|33|18|And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
Genesis|33|19|And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechemâ€™s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
Genesis|33|20|And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Genesis|34|1|And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Genesis|34|2|And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
Genesis|34|3|And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
Genesis|34|4|And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|5|Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis|34|6|And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Genesis|34|7|And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacobâ€™s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
Genesis|34|8|And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.
Genesis|34|9|And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
Genesis|34|10|And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
Genesis|34|11|And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Genesis|34|12|Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|13|And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
Genesis|34|14|and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.
Genesis|34|15|Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
Genesis|34|16|then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
Genesis|34|17|But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
Genesis|34|18|And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamorâ€™s son.
Genesis|34|19|And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacobâ€™s daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
Genesis|34|20|And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
Genesis|34|21|These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis|34|22|Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Genesis|34|23|Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
Genesis|34|24|And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis|34|25|And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinahâ€™s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
Genesis|34|26|And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechemâ€™s house, and went forth.
Genesis|34|27|The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis|34|28|They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
Genesis|34|29|and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
Genesis|34|30|And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
Genesis|34|31|And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
Genesis|35|1|And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Genesis|35|2|Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
Genesis|35|3|and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
Genesis|35|4|And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Genesis|35|5|And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
Genesis|35|6|So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
Genesis|35|7|And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Genesis|35|8|And Deborah Rebekahâ€™s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
Genesis|35|9|And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis|35|10|And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
Genesis|35|11|And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Genesis|35|12|and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
Genesis|35|13|And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
Genesis|35|14|And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
Genesis|35|15|And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
Genesis|35|16|And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
Genesis|35|17|And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
Genesis|35|18|And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
Genesis|35|19|And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis|35|20|And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachelâ€™s grave unto this day.
Genesis|35|21|And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis|35|22|And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his fatherâ€™s concubine: and Israel heard of it.      Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Genesis|35|23|The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacobâ€™s first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
Genesis|35|24|the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis|35|25|and the sons of Bilhah, Rachelâ€™s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
Genesis|35|26|and the sons of Zilpah, Leahâ€™s handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis|35|27|And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
Genesis|35|28|And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
Genesis|35|29|And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
Genesis|36|1|Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
Genesis|36|2|Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
Genesis|36|3|and Basemath Ishmaelâ€™s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis|36|4|And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;
Genesis|36|5|and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|36|6|And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis|36|7|For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.
Genesis|36|8|And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
Genesis|36|9|And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
Genesis|36|10|these are the names of Esauâ€™s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
Genesis|36|11|And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
Genesis|36|12|And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esauâ€™s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esauâ€™s wife.
Genesis|36|13|And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esauâ€™s wife.
Genesis|36|14|And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esauâ€™s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.
Genesis|36|15|These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
Genesis|36|16|chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
Genesis|36|17|And these are the sons of Reuel, Esauâ€™s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esauâ€™s wife.
Genesis|36|18|And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esauâ€™s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esauâ€™s wife.
Genesis|36|19|These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.
Genesis|36|20|These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,
Genesis|36|21|and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
Genesis|36|22|And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotanâ€™s sister was Timna.
Genesis|36|23|And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
Genesis|36|24|And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
Genesis|36|25|And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.
Genesis|36|26|And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
Genesis|36|27|These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
Genesis|36|28|These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
Genesis|36|29|These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
Genesis|36|30|chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
Genesis|36|31|And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
Genesis|36|32|And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis|36|33|And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
Genesis|36|34|And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.
Genesis|36|35|And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
Genesis|36|36|And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
Genesis|36|37|And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.
Genesis|36|38|And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
Genesis|36|39|And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wifeâ€™s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.
Genesis|36|40|And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
Genesis|36|41|chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
Genesis|36|42|chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
Genesis|36|43|chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
Genesis|37|1|And Jacob dwelt in the land of his fatherâ€™s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|37|2|These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his fatherâ€™s wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.
Genesis|37|3|Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
Genesis|37|4|And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
Genesis|37|5|And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
Genesis|37|6|And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
Genesis|37|7|for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
Genesis|37|8|And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
Genesis|37|9|And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
Genesis|37|10|And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
Genesis|37|11|And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
Genesis|37|12|And his brethren went to feed their fatherâ€™s flock in Shechem.
Genesis|37|13|And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
Genesis|37|14|And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Genesis|37|15|And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
Genesis|37|16|And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding {the flock}.
Genesis|37|17|And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
Genesis|37|18|And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
Genesis|37|19|And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
Genesis|37|20|Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
Genesis|37|21|And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
Genesis|37|22|And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
Genesis|37|23|And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
Genesis|37|24|and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
Genesis|37|25|And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
Genesis|37|26|And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
Genesis|37|27|Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.
Genesis|37|28|And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
Genesis|37|29|And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
Genesis|37|30|And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
Genesis|37|31|And they took Josephâ€™s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;
Genesis|37|32|and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy sonâ€™s coat or not.
Genesis|37|33|And he knew it, and said, It is my sonâ€™s coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
Genesis|37|34|And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis|37|35|And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
Genesis|37|36|And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohâ€™s, the captain of the guard.
Genesis|38|1|And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis|38|2|And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her.
Genesis|38|3|And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
Genesis|38|4|And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
Genesis|38|5|And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
Genesis|38|6|And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.
Genesis|38|7|And Er, Judahâ€™s first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him.
Genesis|38|8|And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brotherâ€™s wife, and perform the duty of a husbandâ€™s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
Genesis|38|9|And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brotherâ€™s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
Genesis|38|10|And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.
Genesis|38|11|Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy fatherâ€™s house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her fatherâ€™s house.
Genesis|38|12|And in process of time Shuaâ€™s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis|38|13|And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
Genesis|38|14|And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.
Genesis|38|15|When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.
Genesis|38|16|And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
Genesis|38|17|And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
Genesis|38|18|And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
Genesis|38|19|And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Genesis|38|20|And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the womanâ€™s hand: but he found her not.
Genesis|38|21|Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.
Genesis|38|22|And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.
Genesis|38|23|And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
Genesis|38|24|And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
Genesis|38|25|When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.
Genesis|38|26|And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
Genesis|38|27|And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
Genesis|38|28|And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
Genesis|38|29|And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.
Genesis|38|30|And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.
Genesis|39|1|And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohâ€™s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.
Genesis|39|2|And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
Genesis|39|3|And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis|39|4|And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
Genesis|39|5|And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptianâ€™s house for Josephâ€™s sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
Genesis|39|6|And he left all that he had in Josephâ€™s hand; and he knew not aught {that was} with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.
Genesis|39|7|And it came to pass after these things, that his masterâ€™s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
Genesis|39|8|But he refused, and said unto his masterâ€™s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:
Genesis|39|9|he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
Genesis|39|10|And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, {or} to be with her.
Genesis|39|11|And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
Genesis|39|12|And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis|39|13|And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
Genesis|39|14|that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
Genesis|39|15|and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis|39|16|And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
Genesis|39|17|And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
Genesis|39|18|and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
Genesis|39|19|And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
Genesis|39|20|And Josephâ€™s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the kingâ€™s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
Genesis|39|21|But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Genesis|39|22|And the keeper of the prison committed to Josephâ€™s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
Genesis|39|23|The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper.
Genesis|40|1|And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
Genesis|40|2|And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
Genesis|40|3|And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
Genesis|40|4|And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
Genesis|40|5|And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
Genesis|40|6|And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
Genesis|40|7|And he asked Pharaohâ€™s officers that were with him in ward in his masterâ€™s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?
Genesis|40|8|And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.
Genesis|40|9|And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
Genesis|40|10|and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, {and} its blossoms shot forth; {and} the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
Genesis|40|11|and Pharaohâ€™s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaohâ€™s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaohâ€™s hand.
Genesis|40|12|And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
Genesis|40|13|within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaohâ€™s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
Genesis|40|14|But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
Genesis|40|15|for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
Genesis|40|16|When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:
Genesis|40|17|and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
Genesis|40|18|And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
Genesis|40|19|within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
Genesis|40|20|And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaohâ€™s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Genesis|40|21|And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaohâ€™s hand:
Genesis|40|22|but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis|40|23|Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
Genesis|41|1|And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
Genesis|41|2|And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.
Genesis|41|3|And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
Genesis|41|4|And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis|41|5|And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
Genesis|41|6|And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
Genesis|41|7|And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
Genesis|41|8|And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|9|Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
Genesis|41|10|Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:
Genesis|41|11|and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
Genesis|41|12|And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
Genesis|41|13|And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
Genesis|41|14|Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|15|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.
Genesis|41|16|And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
Genesis|41|17|And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:
Genesis|41|18|and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:
Genesis|41|19|and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
Genesis|41|20|and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Genesis|41|21|and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Genesis|41|22|And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:
Genesis|41|23|and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, {and} blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
Genesis|41|24|and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
Genesis|41|25|And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|26|The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
Genesis|41|27|And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis|41|28|That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|29|Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
Genesis|41|30|and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Genesis|41|31|and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
Genesis|41|32|And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Genesis|41|33|Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|34|Let Pharaoh do {this}, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
Genesis|41|35|And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
Genesis|41|36|And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
Genesis|41|37|And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
Genesis|41|38|And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
Genesis|41|39|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:
Genesis|41|40|thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
Genesis|41|41|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|42|And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Josephâ€™s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
Genesis|41|43|and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|44|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|45|And Pharaoh called Josephâ€™s name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|46|And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|47|And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Genesis|41|48|And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
Genesis|41|49|And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
Genesis|41|50|And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.
Genesis|41|51|And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, {said he}, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my fatherâ€™s house.
Genesis|41|52|And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis|41|53|And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
Genesis|41|54|And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Genesis|41|55|And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
Genesis|41|56|And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|57|And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.
Genesis|42|1|Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
Genesis|42|2|And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
Genesis|42|3|And Josephâ€™s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis|42|4|But Benjamin, Josephâ€™s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.
Genesis|42|5|And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|6|And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Josephâ€™s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
Genesis|42|7|And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Genesis|42|8|And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
Genesis|42|9|And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|10|And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
Genesis|42|11|We are all one manâ€™s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
Genesis|42|12|And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|13|And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
Genesis|42|14|And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
Genesis|42|15|hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Genesis|42|16|Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
Genesis|42|17|And he put them all together into ward three days.
Genesis|42|18|And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:
Genesis|42|19|if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:
Genesis|42|20|and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
Genesis|42|21|And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
Genesis|42|22|And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
Genesis|42|23|And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
Genesis|42|24|And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis|42|25|Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every manâ€™s money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them.
Genesis|42|26|And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
Genesis|42|27|And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis|42|28|And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
Genesis|42|29|And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
Genesis|42|30|The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis|42|31|And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:
Genesis|42|32|we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|33|And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take {grain for} the famine of your houses, and go your way;
Genesis|42|34|and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.
Genesis|42|35|And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every manâ€™s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Genesis|42|36|And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
Genesis|42|37|And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
Genesis|42|38|And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|43|1|And the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|43|2|And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis|43|3|And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|4|If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
Genesis|43|5|but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|6|And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
Genesis|43|7|And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Genesis|43|8|And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
Genesis|43|9|I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
Genesis|43|10|for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
Genesis|43|11|And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
Genesis|43|12|and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
Genesis|43|13|take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Genesis|43|14|and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Genesis|43|15|And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Genesis|43|16|And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
Genesis|43|17|And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Josephâ€™s house.
Genesis|43|18|And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Josephâ€™s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
Genesis|43|19|And they came near to the steward of Josephâ€™s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,
Genesis|43|20|and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
Genesis|43|21|and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every manâ€™s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
Genesis|43|22|And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis|43|23|And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
Genesis|43|24|And the man brought the men into Josephâ€™s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.
Genesis|43|25|And they made ready the present against Josephâ€™s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Genesis|43|26|And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
Genesis|43|27|And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
Genesis|43|28|And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
Genesis|43|29|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his motherâ€™s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
Genesis|43|30|And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
Genesis|43|31|And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
Genesis|43|32|And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis|43|33|And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.
Genesis|43|34|And he took {and sent} messes unto them from before him: but Benjaminâ€™s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Genesis|44|1|And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the menâ€™s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every manâ€™s money in his sackâ€™s mouth.
Genesis|44|2|And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sackâ€™s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Genesis|44|3|As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Genesis|44|4|{And} when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis|44|5|Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Genesis|44|6|And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
Genesis|44|7|And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
Genesis|44|8|Behold, the money, which we found in our sacksâ€™ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lordâ€™s house silver or gold?
Genesis|44|9|With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lordâ€™s bondmen.
Genesis|44|10|And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.
Genesis|44|11|Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Genesis|44|12|And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjaminâ€™s sack.
Genesis|44|13|Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
Genesis|44|14|And Judah and his brethren came to Josephâ€™s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis|44|15|And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
Genesis|44|16|And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lordâ€™s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
Genesis|44|17|And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Genesis|44|18|Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lordâ€™s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
Genesis|44|19|My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
Genesis|44|20|And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.
Genesis|44|21|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
Genesis|44|22|And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
Genesis|44|23|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
Genesis|44|24|And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Genesis|44|25|And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis|44|26|And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the manâ€™s face, expect our youngest brother be with us.
Genesis|44|27|And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
Genesis|44|28|and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
Genesis|44|29|and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|44|30|Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the ladâ€™s life;
Genesis|44|31|it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not {with us}, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|44|32|For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.
Genesis|44|33|Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
Genesis|44|34|For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
Genesis|45|1|Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
Genesis|45|2|And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis|45|3|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
Genesis|45|4|And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Genesis|45|5|And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Genesis|45|6|For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
Genesis|45|7|And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
Genesis|45|8|So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|45|9|Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;
Genesis|45|10|and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy childrenâ€™s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Genesis|45|11|and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.
Genesis|45|12|And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Genesis|45|13|And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
Genesis|45|14|And he fell upon his brother Benjaminâ€™s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Genesis|45|15|And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
Genesis|45|16|And the report thereof was heard in Pharaohâ€™s house, saying, Josephâ€™s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
Genesis|45|17|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Genesis|45|18|and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Genesis|45|19|Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis|45|20|Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
Genesis|45|21|And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
Genesis|45|22|To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
Genesis|45|23|And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
Genesis|45|24|So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
Genesis|45|25|And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.
Genesis|45|26|And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.
Genesis|45|27|And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
Genesis|45|28|and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
Genesis|46|1|And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis|46|2|And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis|46|3|And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
Genesis|46|4|I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
Genesis|46|5|And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis|46|6|And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
Genesis|46|7|his sons, and his sonsâ€™ sons with him, his daughters, and his sonsâ€™ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
Genesis|46|8|And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacobâ€™s first-born.
Genesis|46|9|And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
Genesis|46|10|And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
Genesis|46|11|And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis|46|12|And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis|46|13|And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.
Genesis|46|14|And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis|46|15|These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
Genesis|46|16|And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis|46|17|And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.
Genesis|46|18|These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
Genesis|46|19|The sons of Rachel Jacobâ€™s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis|46|20|And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.
Genesis|46|21|And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
Genesis|46|22|These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
Genesis|46|23|And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis|46|24|And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
Genesis|46|25|These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
Genesis|46|26|All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacobâ€™s sonsâ€™ wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
Genesis|46|27|and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
Genesis|46|28|And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis|46|29|And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis|46|30|And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.
Genesis|46|31|And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his fatherâ€™s house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my fatherâ€™s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Genesis|46|32|and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Genesis|46|33|And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
Genesis|46|34|that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis|47|1|Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|47|2|And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|3|And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
Genesis|47|4|And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servantsâ€™ flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|47|5|And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Genesis|47|6|the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Genesis|47|7|And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|8|And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
Genesis|47|9|And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Genesis|47|10|And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|11|And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis|47|12|And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his fatherâ€™s household, with bread, according to their families.
Genesis|47|13|And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Genesis|47|14|And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaohâ€™s house.
Genesis|47|15|And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for {our} money faileth.
Genesis|47|16|And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
Genesis|47|17|And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
Genesis|47|18|And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lordâ€™s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Genesis|47|19|wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.
Genesis|47|20|So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaohâ€™s.
Genesis|47|21|And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
Genesis|47|22|Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.
Genesis|47|23|Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Genesis|47|24|And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Genesis|47|25|And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaohâ€™s servants.
Genesis|47|26|And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaohâ€™s.
Genesis|47|27|And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
Genesis|47|28|And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.
Genesis|47|29|And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;
Genesis|47|30|but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Genesis|47|31|And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bedâ€™s head.
Genesis|48|1|And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis|48|2|And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Genesis|48|3|And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis|48|4|and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Genesis|48|5|And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
Genesis|48|6|And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Genesis|48|7|And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis|48|8|And Israel beheld Josephâ€™s sons, and said, Who are these?
Genesis|48|9|And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Genesis|48|10|Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Genesis|48|11|And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.
Genesis|48|12|And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Genesis|48|13|And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israelâ€™s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israelâ€™s right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Genesis|48|14|And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraimâ€™s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manassehâ€™s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.
Genesis|48|15|And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,
Genesis|48|16|the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Genesis|48|17|And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his fatherâ€™s hand, to remove it from Ephraimâ€™s head unto Manassehâ€™s head.
Genesis|48|18|And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
Genesis|48|19|And his father refused, and said, I know {it}, my son, I know {it}. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Genesis|48|20|And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis|48|21|And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Genesis|48|22|Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Genesis|49|1|And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.
Genesis|49|2|Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;                   And hearken unto Israel your father.
Genesis|49|3|Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength;                   The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.
Genesis|49|4|Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence;                   Because thou wentest up to thy fatherâ€™s bed;                   Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
Genesis|49|5|Simeon and Levi are brethren;                   Weapons of violence are their swords.
Genesis|49|6|O my soul, come not thou into their council;                   Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united;                   For in their anger they slew a man,                   And in their self-will they hocked an ox.
Genesis|49|7|Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;                   And their wrath, for it was cruel:                   I will divide them in Jacob,                   And scatter them in Israel.
Genesis|49|8|Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise:                   Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies;                   Thy fatherâ€™s sons shall bow down before thee.
Genesis|49|9|Judah is a lionâ€™s whelp;                   From the prey, my son, thou art gone up:                   He stooped down, he couched as a lion,                   And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
Genesis|49|10|The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,                   Nor the rulerâ€™s staff from between his feet,                   Until Shiloh come:                   And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
Genesis|49|11|Binding his foal unto the vine,                   And his assâ€™s colt unto the choice vine;                   He hath washed his garments in wine,                   And his vesture in the blood of grapes:
Genesis|49|12|His eyes shall be red with wine,                   And his teeth white with milk.
Genesis|49|13|Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;                   And he shall be for a haven of ships;                   And his border shall be upon Sidon.
Genesis|49|14|Issachar is a strong ass,                   Couching down between the sheepfolds:
Genesis|49|15|And he saw a resting-place that it was good,                   And the land that it was pleasant;                   And he bowed his shoulder to bear,                   And became a servant under taskwork.
Genesis|49|16|Dan shall judge his people,                   As one of the tribes of Israel.
Genesis|49|17|Dan shall be a serpent in the way,                   An adder in the path,                   That biteth the horseâ€™s heels,                   So that his rider falleth backward.
Genesis|49|18|I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.
Genesis|49|19|Gad, a troop shall press upon him;                   But he shall press upon their heel.
Genesis|49|20|Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat,                   And he shall yield royal dainties.
Genesis|49|21|Naphtali is a hind let loose:                   He giveth goodly words.
Genesis|49|22|Joseph is a fruitful bough,                   A fruitful bough by a fountain;                   His branches run over the wall.
Genesis|49|23|The archers have sorely grieved him,                   And shot at him, and persecute him:
Genesis|49|24|But his bow abode in strength,                   And the arms of his hands were made strong,                   By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,                   (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
Genesis|49|25|Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee,                   And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee,                   With blessings of heaven above,                   Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath,                   Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
Genesis|49|26|The blessings of thy father                   Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors                   Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:                   They shall be on the head of Joseph,                   And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Genesis|49|27|Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth:                   In the morning she shall devour the prey,                   And at even he shall divide the spoil.
Genesis|49|28|All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
Genesis|49|29|And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis|49|30|in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
Genesis|49|31|there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:
Genesis|49|32|the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
Genesis|49|33|And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis|50|1|And Joseph fell upon his fatherâ€™s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
Genesis|50|2|And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis|50|3|And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.
Genesis|50|4|And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis|50|5|My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
Genesis|50|6|And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
Genesis|50|7|And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis|50|8|and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his fatherâ€™s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|50|9|And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
Genesis|50|10|And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis|50|11|And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
Genesis|50|12|And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
Genesis|50|13|for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
Genesis|50|14|And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
Genesis|50|15|And when Josephâ€™s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
Genesis|50|16|And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
Genesis|50|17|So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Genesis|50|18|And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
Genesis|50|19|And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Genesis|50|20|And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Genesis|50|21|Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
Genesis|50|22|And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his fatherâ€™s house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
Genesis|50|23|And Joseph saw Ephraimâ€™s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Josephâ€™s knees.
Genesis|50|24|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Genesis|50|25|And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
Genesis|50|26|So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
1 Peter|1|1|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
1 Peter|1|2|according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
1 Peter|1|3|Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1 Peter|1|4|unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
1 Peter|1|5|who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter|1|6|Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,
1 Peter|1|7|that the proof of your faith, {being} more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
1 Peter|1|8|whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
1 Peter|1|9|receiving the end of your faith, {even} the salvation of {your} souls.
1 Peter|1|10|Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that {should come} unto you:
1 Peter|1|11|searching what {time} or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.
1 Peter|1|12|To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angel desire to look into.
1 Peter|1|13|Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
1 Peter|1|14|as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in {the time of} your ignorance:
1 Peter|1|15|but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;
1 Peter|1|16|because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.
1 Peter|1|17|And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each manâ€™s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:
1 Peter|1|18|knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;
1 Peter|1|19|but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, {even the blood} of Christ:
1 Peter|1|20|who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of times for your sake,
1 Peter|1|21|who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.
1 Peter|1|22|Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:
1 Peter|1|23|having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.
1 Peter|1|24|For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:
1 Peter|1|25|But the word of the Lord abideth for ever. And this is the word of good tidings which was preached unto you.
1 Peter|2|1|Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
1 Peter|2|2|as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;
1 Peter|2|3|if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
1 Peter|2|4|unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,
1 Peter|2|5|ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter|2|6|Because it is contained in scripture,             Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious:                   And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
1 Peter|2|7|For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve,             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner;
1 Peter|2|8|and,             A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence;            for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
1 Peter|2|9|But ye are a elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for {Godâ€™s} own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
1 Peter|2|10|who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
1 Peter|2|11|Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;
1 Peter|2|12|having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
1 Peter|2|13|Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
1 Peter|2|14|or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.
1 Peter|2|15|For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
1 Peter|2|16|as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
1 Peter|2|17|Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
1 Peter|2|18|Servants, {be} in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
1 Peter|2|19|For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.
1 Peter|2|20|For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted {for it}, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer {for it}, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
1 Peter|2|21|For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:
1 Peter|2|22|who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
1 Peter|2|23|who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered threatened not; but committed {himself} to him that judgeth righteously:
1 Peter|2|24|who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
1 Peter|2|25|For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1 Peter|3|1|In like manner, ye wives, {be} in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;
1 Peter|3|2|beholding your chaste behavior {coupled} with fear.
1 Peter|3|3|Whose {adorning} let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;
1 Peter|3|4|but {let it be} the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible {apparel} of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
1 Peter|3|5|For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
1 Peter|3|6|as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
1 Peter|3|7|Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with {your wives} according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.
1 Peter|3|8|Finally, {be} ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:
1 Peter|3|9|not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
1 Peter|3|10|For,             He that would love life,                   And see good days,                   Let him refrain his tongue from evil,                   And his lips that they speak no guile:
1 Peter|3|11|And let him turn away from evil, and do good;                   Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
1 Peter|3|12|For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,                   And his ears unto their supplication:                   But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.
1 Peter|3|13|And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?
1 Peter|3|14|But even if ye should suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, blessed {are ye:} and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;
1 Peter|3|15|but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: {being} ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:
1 Peter|3|16|having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.
1 Peter|3|17|For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
1 Peter|3|18|Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
1 Peter|3|19|in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,
1 Peter|3|20|that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
1 Peter|3|21|which also after a true likeness doth now save you, {even} baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
1 Peter|3|22|who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
1 Peter|4|1|Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
1 Peter|4|2|that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
1 Peter|4|3|For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:
1 Peter|4|4|wherein they think it strange that ye run not with {them} into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of {you}:
1 Peter|4|5|who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter|4|6|For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
1 Peter|4|7|But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer:
1 Peter|4|8|above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins:
1 Peter|4|9|using hospitality one to another without murmuring:
1 Peter|4|10|according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
1 Peter|4|11|if any man speaketh, {speaking} as it were oracles of God; is any man ministereth, {ministering} as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter|4|12|Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:
1 Peter|4|13|but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.
1 Peter|4|14|If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed {are ye}; because the {Spirit} of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.
1 Peter|4|15|For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other menâ€™s matters:
1 Peter|4|16|but if {a man suffer} as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.
1 Peter|4|17|For the time {is come} for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if {it begin} first at us, what {shall be} the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?
1 Peter|4|18|And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?
1 Peter|4|19|Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.
1 Peter|5|1|The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
1 Peter|5|2|Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to {the will of} God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
1 Peter|5|3|neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.
1 Peter|5|4|And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
1 Peter|5|5|Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
1 Peter|5|6|Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
1 Peter|5|7|casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.
1 Peter|5|8|Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour,
1 Peter|5|9|whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
1 Peter|5|10|And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
1 Peter|5|11|To him {be} the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter|5|12|By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account {him}, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand ye fast therein.
1 Peter|5|13|She that is in Babylon, elect together with {you}, saluteth you; and {so doth} Mark my son.
1 Peter|5|14|Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.
James|1|1|James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.
James|1|2|Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;
James|1|3|Knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.
James|1|4|And let patience have {its} perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.
James|1|5|But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
James|1|6|But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.
James|1|7|For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;
James|1|8|a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.
James|1|9|But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:
James|1|10|and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
James|1|11|For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass: and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.
James|1|12|Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which {the Lord} promised to them that love him.
James|1|13|Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:
James|1|14|but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
James|1|15|Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.
James|1|16|Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.
James|1|17|Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.
James|1|18|Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
James|1|19|Ye know {this}, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
James|1|20|for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
James|1|21|Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
James|1|22|But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.
James|1|23|For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:
James|1|24|for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
James|1|25|But he that looketh into the perfect law, the {law} of liberty, and {so} continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.
James|1|26|If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this manâ€™s religion is vain.
James|1|27|Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, {and} to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
James|2|1|My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, {the Lord} of glory, with respect of persons.
James|2|2|For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;
James|2|3|and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;
James|2|4|Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
James|2|5|Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world {to be} rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?
James|2|6|But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?
James|2|7|Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?
James|2|8|Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:
James|2|9|but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
James|2|10|For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one {point}, he is become guilty of all.
James|2|11|For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
James|2|12|So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.
James|2|13|For judgment {is} without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.
James|2|14|What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?
James|2|15|If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,
James|2|16|and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?
James|2|17|Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
James|2|18|Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from {thy} works, and I by my works will show thee {my} faith.
James|2|19|Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
James|2|20|But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?
James|2|21|Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
James|2|22|Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;
James|2|23|and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
James|2|24|Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
James|2|25|And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
James|2|26|For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
James|3|1|Be not many {of you} teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.
James|3|2|For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
James|3|3|Now if we put the horsesâ€™ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.
James|3|4|Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.
James|3|5|So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!
James|3|6|And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.
James|3|7|For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.
James|3|8|But the tongue can no man tame; {it is} a restless evil, {it is} full of deadly poison.
James|3|9|Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:
James|3|10|out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
James|3|11|Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet {water} and bitter?
James|3|12|Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither {can} salt water yield sweet.
James|3|13|Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.
James|3|14|But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.
James|3|15|This wisdom is not {a wisdom} that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
James|3|16|For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.
James|3|17|But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.
James|3|18|And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.
James|4|1|Whence {come} wars and whence {come} fightings among you? {come they} not hence, {even} of your pleasures that war in your members?
James|4|2|Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.
James|4|3|Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend {it} in your pleasures.
James|4|4|Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.
James|4|5|Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?
James|4|6|But he giveth more grace. Wherefore {the scripture} saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
James|4|7|Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James|4|8|Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.
James|4|9|Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
James|4|10|Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.
James|4|11|Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
James|4|12|One {only} is the lawgiver and judge, {even} he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?
James|4|13|Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:
James|4|14|whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
James|4|15|For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.
James|4|16|But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.
James|4|17|To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
James|5|1|Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.
James|5|2|Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
James|5|3|Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.
James|5|4|Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
James|5|5|Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James|5|6|Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous {one}; he doth not resist you.
James|5|7|Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain.
James|5|8|Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
James|5|9|Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.
James|5|10|Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord.
James|5|11|Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.
James|5|12|But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.
James|5|13|Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.
James|5|14|Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James|5|15|and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.
James|5|16|Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.
James|5|17|Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.
James|5|18|And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
James|5|19|My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;
James|5|20|let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
1 Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;
1 Timothy|1|2|unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Timothy|1|3|As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
1 Timothy|1|4|neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; {so do I now}.
1 Timothy|1|5|But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:
1 Timothy|1|6|from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;
1 Timothy|1|7|desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.
1 Timothy|1|8|But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,
1 Timothy|1|9|as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
1 Timothy|1|10|for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
1 Timothy|1|11|according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1 Timothy|1|12|I thank him that enabled me, {even} Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to {his} service;
1 Timothy|1|13|though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;
1 Timothy|1|14|and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy|1|15|Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:
1 Timothy|1|16|howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.
1 Timothy|1|17|Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, {be} honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
1 Timothy|1|18|This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;
1 Timothy|1|19|holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:
1 Timothy|1|20|of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
1 Timothy|2|1|I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
1 Timothy|2|2|for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
1 Timothy|2|3|This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1 Timothy|2|4|who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy|2|5|For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, {himself} man, Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy|2|6|who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony {to be borne} in its own times;
1 Timothy|2|7|whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1 Timothy|2|8|I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
1 Timothy|2|9|In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;
1 Timothy|2|10|but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.
1 Timothy|2|11|Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
1 Timothy|2|12|But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
1 Timothy|2|13|For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
1 Timothy|2|14|and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:
1 Timothy|2|15|but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
1 Timothy|3|1|Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
1 Timothy|3|2|The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1 Timothy|3|3|no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;
1 Timothy|3|4|one that ruleth well his own house, having {his} children in subjection with all gravity;
1 Timothy|3|5|(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
1 Timothy|3|6|not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1 Timothy|3|7|Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1 Timothy|3|8|Deacons in like manner {must be} grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
1 Timothy|3|9|holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy|3|10|And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.
1 Timothy|3|11|Women in like manner {must be} grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
1 Timothy|3|12|Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling {their} children and their own houses well.
1 Timothy|3|13|For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy|3|14|These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly;
1 Timothy|3|15|but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
1 Timothy|3|16|And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness;             He who was manifested in the flesh,                   Justified in the spirit,                   Seen of angels,                   Preached among the nations,                   Believed on in the world,                   Received up in glory.
1 Timothy|4|1|But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
1 Timothy|4|2|through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
1 Timothy|4|3|forbidding to marry, {and commanding} to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy|4|4|For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:
1 Timothy|4|5|for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy|4|6|If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed {until now}:
1 Timothy|4|7|but refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:
1 Timothy|4|8|for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.
1 Timothy|4|9|Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.
1 Timothy|4|10|For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.
1 Timothy|4|11|These things command and teach.
1 Timothy|4|12|Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.
1 Timothy|4|13|Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
1 Timothy|4|14|Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
1 Timothy|4|15|Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.
1 Timothy|4|16|Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.
1 Timothy|5|1|Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:
1 Timothy|5|2|the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
1 Timothy|5|3|Honor widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy|5|4|But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
1 Timothy|5|5|Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
1 Timothy|5|6|But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1 Timothy|5|7|These things also command, that they may be without reproach.
1 Timothy|5|8|But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
1 Timothy|5|9|Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, {having been} the wife of one man,
1 Timothy|5|10|well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saintsâ€™ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.
1 Timothy|5|11|But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
1 Timothy|5|12|having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
1 Timothy|5|13|And withal they learn also {to be} idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
1 Timothy|5|14|I desire therefore that the younger {widows} marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:
1 Timothy|5|15|for already some are turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy|5|16|If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy|5|17|Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
1 Timothy|5|18|For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his hire.
1 Timothy|5|19|Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at {the mouth of} two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy|5|20|Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
1 Timothy|5|21|I charge {thee} in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
1 Timothy|5|22|Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other menâ€™s sins: keep thyself pure.
1 Timothy|5|23|Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake and thine often infirmities.
1 Timothy|5|24|Some menâ€™s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.
1 Timothy|5|25|In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.
1 Timothy|6|1|Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.
1 Timothy|6|2|And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.
1 Timothy|6|3|If any man teacheth a different doctrine, and consenteth not to sound words, {even} the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
1 Timothy|6|4|he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1 Timothy|6|5|wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.
1 Timothy|6|6|But godliness with contentment is great gain:
1 Timothy|6|7|for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;
1 Timothy|6|8|but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.
1 Timothy|6|9|But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.
1 Timothy|6|10|For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1 Timothy|6|11|But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
1 Timothy|6|12|Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
1 Timothy|6|13|I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;
1 Timothy|6|14|that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Timothy|6|15|which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1 Timothy|6|16|who only hath immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom {be} honor and power eternal. Amen.
1 Timothy|6|17|Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
1 Timothy|6|18|that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1 Timothy|6|19|laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life which is {life} indeed.
1 Timothy|6|20|O Timothy, guard that which is committed unto {thee}, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;
1 Timothy|6|21|which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.
2 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;
2 Thessalonians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|1|3|We are bound to give thanks to God always to you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith growth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth;
2 Thessalonians|1|4|so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;
2 Thessalonians|1|5|{which is} a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
2 Thessalonians|1|6|if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you,
2 Thessalonians|1|7|and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,
2 Thessalonians|1|8|rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus:
2 Thessalonians|1|9|who shall suffer punishment, {even} eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
2 Thessalonians|1|10|when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.
2 Thessalonians|1|11|To which end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and {every} work of faith, with power;
2 Thessalonians|1|12|that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|2|1|Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;
2 Thessalonians|2|2|to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;
2 Thessalonians|2|3|let no man beguile you in any wise: for {it will not be,} except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
2 Thessalonians|2|4|he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.
2 Thessalonians|2|5|Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians|2|6|And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
2 Thessalonians|2|7|For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only {there is} one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians|2|8|And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;
2 Thessalonians|2|9|{even he}, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
2 Thessalonians|2|10|and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2 Thessalonians|2|11|And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:
2 Thessalonians|2|12|that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians|2|13|But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
2 Thessalonians|2|14|whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|2|15|So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
2 Thessalonians|2|16|Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians|2|17|comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians|3|1|Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also {it is} with you;
2 Thessalonians|3|2|and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.
2 Thessalonians|3|3|But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil {one}.
2 Thessalonians|3|4|And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.
2 Thessalonians|3|5|And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
2 Thessalonians|3|6|Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
2 Thessalonians|3|7|For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians|3|8|neither did we eat bread for nought at any manâ€™s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:
2 Thessalonians|3|9|not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.
2 Thessalonians|3|10|For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.
2 Thessalonians|3|11|For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.
2 Thessalonians|3|12|Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians|3|13|But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.
2 Thessalonians|3|14|And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians|3|15|And {yet} count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians|3|16|Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians|3|17|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
2 Thessalonians|3|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Mark|1|1|The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mark|1|2|Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.
Mark|1|3|The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;
Mark|1|4|John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.
Mark|1|5|And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark|1|6|And John was clothed with camelâ€™s hair, and {had} a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.
Mark|1|7|And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
Mark|1|8|I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
Mark|1|9|And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
Mark|1|10|And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:
Mark|1|11|And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
Mark|1|12|And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.
Mark|1|13|And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.
Mark|1|14|Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
Mark|1|15|and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.
Mark|1|16|And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.
Mark|1|17|And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark|1|18|And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.
Mark|1|19|And going on a little further, he saw James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.
Mark|1|20|And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
Mark|1|21|And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
Mark|1|22|And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark|1|23|And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark|1|24|saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Mark|1|25|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Mark|1|26|And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark|1|27|And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
Mark|1|28|And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
Mark|1|29|And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark|1|30|Now Simonâ€™s wifeâ€™s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:
Mark|1|31|and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
Mark|1|32|And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.
Mark|1|33|And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark|1|34|And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Mark|1|35|And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.
Mark|1|36|And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
Mark|1|37|and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.
Mark|1|38|And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.
Mark|1|39|And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
Mark|1|40|And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark|1|41|And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.
Mark|1|42|And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
Mark|1|43|And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,
Mark|1|44|and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|1|45|But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
Mark|2|1|And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark|2|2|And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room {for them}, no, not even about the door: and he spake the word unto them.
Mark|2|3|And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.
Mark|2|4|And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.
Mark|2|5|And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.
Mark|2|6|But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark|2|7|Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, {even} God?
Mark|2|8|And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
Mark|2|9|Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
Mark|2|10|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),
Mark|2|11|I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.
Mark|2|12|And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
Mark|2|13|And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
Mark|2|14|And as he passed by, he saw Levi the {son} of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
Mark|2|15|And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark|2|16|And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, {How is it} that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
Mark|2|17|And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Mark|2|18|And Johnâ€™s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do Johnâ€™s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark|2|19|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark|2|20|But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.
Mark|2|21|No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made.
Mark|2|22|And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins: but {they put} new wine into fresh wine-skins.
Mark|2|23|And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.
Mark|2|24|And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
Mark|2|25|And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?
Mark|2|26|How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?
Mark|2|27|And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Mark|2|28|so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
Mark|3|1|And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
Mark|3|2|And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
Mark|3|3|And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.
Mark|3|4|And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
Mark|3|5|And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
Mark|3|6|And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
Mark|3|7|And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,
Mark|3|8|and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.
Mark|3|9|And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:
Mark|3|10|for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
Mark|3|11|And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
Mark|3|12|And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
Mark|3|13|And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.
Mark|3|14|And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark|3|15|and to have authority to cast out demons:
Mark|3|16|and Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark|3|17|and James the {son} of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
Mark|3|18|and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the {son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
Mark|3|19|and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house.
Mark|3|20|And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
Mark|3|21|And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
Mark|3|22|And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons.
Mark|3|23|And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark|3|24|And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark|3|25|And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
Mark|3|26|And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
Mark|3|27|But no one can enter into the house of the strong {man}, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong {man}; and then he will spoil his house.
Mark|3|28|Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
Mark|3|29|but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:
Mark|3|30|because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark|3|31|And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.
Mark|3|32|And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
Mark|3|33|And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?
Mark|3|34|And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Mark|3|35|For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Mark|4|1|And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.
Mark|4|2|And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,
Mark|4|3|Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:
Mark|4|4|and it came to pass, as he sowed, some {seed} fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.
Mark|4|5|And other fell on the rocky {ground}, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:
Mark|4|6|and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark|4|7|And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark|4|8|And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|9|And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|10|And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.
Mark|4|11|And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:
Mark|4|12|that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.
Mark|4|13|And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?
Mark|4|14|The sower soweth the word.
Mark|4|15|And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.
Mark|4|16|And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky {places}, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;
Mark|4|17|and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.
Mark|4|18|And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,
Mark|4|19|and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
Mark|4|20|And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|21|And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, {and} not to be put on the stand?
Mark|4|22|For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was {anything} made secret, but that it should come to light.
Mark|4|23|If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|24|And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.
Mark|4|25|For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Mark|4|26|And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
Mark|4|27|and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.
Mark|4|28|The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
Mark|4|29|But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.
