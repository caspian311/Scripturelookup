Matthew|12|47|And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
Matthew|12|48|But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Matthew|12|49|And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Matthew|12|50|For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Matthew|13|1|On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
Matthew|13|2|And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
Matthew|13|3|And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
Matthew|13|4|and as he sowed, some {seeds} fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:
Matthew|13|5|and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:
Matthew|13|6|and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew|13|7|And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:
Matthew|13|8|and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew|13|9|He that hath ears, let him hear.
Matthew|13|10|And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
Matthew|13|11|And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
Matthew|13|12|For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew|13|13|Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
Matthew|13|14|And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,             By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;                   And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
Matthew|13|15|For this people’s heart is waxed gross,                   And their ears are dull of hearing,                   And their eyes they have closed;                   Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,                   And hear with their ears,                   And understand with their heart,                   And should turn again,                   And I should heal them.
Matthew|13|16|But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Matthew|13|17|For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Matthew|13|18|Hear then ye the parable of the sower.
Matthew|13|19|When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, {then} cometh the evil {one}, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.
Matthew|13|20|And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;
Matthew|13|21|yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.
Matthew|13|22|And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
Matthew|13|23|And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew|13|24|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:
Matthew|13|25|but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
Matthew|13|26|But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
Matthew|13|27|And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?
Matthew|13|28|And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
Matthew|13|29|But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.
Matthew|13|30|Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
Matthew|13|31|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
Matthew|13|32|which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.
Matthew|13|33|Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
Matthew|13|34|All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:
Matthew|13|35|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,             I will open my mouth in parables;                   I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
Matthew|13|36|Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
Matthew|13|37|And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
Matthew|13|38|and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil {one};
Matthew|13|39|and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew|13|40|As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
Matthew|13|41|The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,
Matthew|13|42|and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|43|Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.
Matthew|13|44|The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
Matthew|13|45|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:
Matthew|13|46|and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
Matthew|13|47|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
Matthew|13|48|which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.
Matthew|13|49|So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,
Matthew|13|50|and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|51|Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.
Matthew|13|52|And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Matthew|13|53|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
Matthew|13|54|And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Matthew|13|55|Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew|13|56|And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
Matthew|13|57|And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
Matthew|13|58|And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew|14|1|At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
Matthew|14|2|and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.
Matthew|14|3|For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
Matthew|14|4|For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew|14|5|And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew|14|6|But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Matthew|14|7|Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.
Matthew|14|8|And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Matthew|14|9|And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given;
Matthew|14|10|and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew|14|11|And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew|14|12|And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.
Matthew|14|13|Now when Jesus heard {it}, he withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard {thereof,} they followed him on foot from the cities.
Matthew|14|14|And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
Matthew|14|15|And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
Matthew|14|16|But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.
Matthew|14|17|And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
Matthew|14|18|And he said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew|14|19|And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|14|20|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
Matthew|14|21|And they that did eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew|14|22|And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.
Matthew|14|23|And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.
Matthew|14|24|But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
Matthew|14|25|And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
Matthew|14|26|And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
Matthew|14|27|But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew|14|28|And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
Matthew|14|29|And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
Matthew|14|30|But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
Matthew|14|31|And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
Matthew|14|32|And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Matthew|14|33|And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
Matthew|14|34|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.
Matthew|14|35|And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick,
Matthew|14|36|and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.
Matthew|15|1|Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,
Matthew|15|2|Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
