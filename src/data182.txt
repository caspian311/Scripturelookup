Mark|6|46|And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
Mark|6|47|And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
Mark|6|48|And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:
Mark|6|49|but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
Mark|6|50|for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
Mark|6|51|And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;
Mark|6|52|for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
Mark|6|53|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
Mark|6|54|And when they were come out of the boat, straightway {the people} knew him,
Mark|6|55|and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
Mark|6|56|And wheresoever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
Mark|7|1|And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
Mark|7|2|and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.
Mark|7|3|(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;
Mark|7|4|and {when they come} from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)
Mark|7|5|And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?
Mark|7|6|And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,             This people honoreth me with their lips,                   But their heart is far from me.
Mark|7|7|But in vain do they worship me,                   Teaching {as their} doctrines the precepts of men.
Mark|7|8|Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.
Mark|7|9|And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.
Mark|7|10|For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:
Mark|7|11|but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given {to God};
Mark|7|12|ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;
Mark|7|13|making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
Mark|7|14|And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:
Mark|7|15|there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
Mark|7|16|{If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.}
Mark|7|17|And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
Mark|7|18|And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, {it} cannot defile him;
Mark|7|19|because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? {This he said}, making all meats clean.
Mark|7|20|And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.
Mark|7|21|For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
Mark|7|22|covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:
Mark|7|23|all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
Mark|7|24|And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.
Mark|7|25|But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
Mark|7|26|Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
Mark|7|27|And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Mark|7|28|But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
Mark|7|29|And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
Mark|7|30|And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
Mark|7|31|And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
Mark|7|32|And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.
Mark|7|33|And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;
Mark|7|34|and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
Mark|7|35|And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
Mark|7|36|And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.
Mark|7|37|And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
Mark|8|1|In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Mark|8|2|I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:
Mark|8|3|and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.
Mark|8|4|And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?
Mark|8|5|And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
Mark|8|6|And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
Mark|8|7|And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.
Mark|8|8|And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.
Mark|8|9|And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark|8|10|And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark|8|11|And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.
Mark|8|12|And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
Mark|8|13|And he left them, and again entering into {the boat} departed to the other side.
Mark|8|14|And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.
Mark|8|15|And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
Mark|8|16|And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.
Mark|8|17|And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?
Mark|8|18|Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
Mark|8|19|When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
Mark|8|20|And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.
Mark|8|21|And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?
Mark|8|22|And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.
Mark|8|23|And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?
Mark|8|24|And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I behold {them} as trees, walking.
Mark|8|25|Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.
Mark|8|26|And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
Mark|8|27|And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?
Mark|8|28|And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.
Mark|8|29|And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
Mark|8|30|And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark|8|31|And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark|8|32|And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark|8|33|But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Mark|8|34|And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark|8|35|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.
Mark|8|36|For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
Mark|8|37|For what should a man give in exchange for his life?
Mark|8|38|For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Mark|9|1|And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There are some here of them that stand {by}, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.
Mark|9|2|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them;
Mark|9|3|and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
Mark|9|4|And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark|9|5|And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Mark|9|6|For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.
Mark|9|7|And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye him.
Mark|9|8|And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
Mark|9|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead.
Mark|9|10|And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.
Mark|9|11|And they asked him, saying, {How is it} that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
Mark|9|12|And he said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought?
Mark|9|13|But I say unto you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him.
Mark|9|14|And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
