Exodus|17|6|Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|17|7|And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?
Exodus|17|8|Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus|17|9|And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
Exodus|17|10|So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus|17|11|And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus|17|12|But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus|17|13|And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus|17|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
Exodus|17|15|And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;
Exodus|17|16|And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
Exodus|18|1|Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus|18|2|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
Exodus|18|3|and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:
Exodus|18|4|and the name of the other was Eliezer; for {he said}, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Exodus|18|5|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:
Exodus|18|6|and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
Exodus|18|7|And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
Exodus|18|8|And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.
Exodus|18|9|And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|10|And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|11|Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
Exodus|18|12|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
Exodus|18|13|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.
Exodus|18|14|And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?
Exodus|18|15|And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
Exodus|18|16|when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
Exodus|18|17|And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
Exodus|18|18|Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
Exodus|18|19|Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:
Exodus|18|20|and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
Exodus|18|21|Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
Exodus|18|22|and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear {the burden} with thee.
Exodus|18|23|If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
Exodus|18|24|So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
Exodus|18|25|And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
Exodus|18|26|And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
Exodus|18|27|And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
Exodus|19|1|In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus|19|2|And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
Exodus|19|3|And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
Exodus|19|4|Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.
Exodus|19|5|Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:
Exodus|19|6|and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
Exodus|19|7|And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.
Exodus|19|8|And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|10|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,
Exodus|19|11|and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
Exodus|19|12|And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
Exodus|19|13|no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
Exodus|19|14|And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
Exodus|19|15|And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
Exodus|19|16|And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
Exodus|19|17|And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
Exodus|19|18|And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
Exodus|19|19|And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
Exodus|19|20|And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
Exodus|19|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
Exodus|19|22|And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|23|And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
Exodus|19|24|And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|25|So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
Exodus|20|1|And God spake all these words, saying,
Exodus|20|2|I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Exodus|20|3|Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Exodus|20|4|Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness {of any thing} that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
Exodus|20|5|Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
Exodus|20|6|and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Exodus|20|7|Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Exodus|20|8|Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus|20|9|Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
Exodus|20|10|but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
Exodus|20|11|for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
Exodus|20|12|Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Exodus|20|13|Thou shalt not kill.
Exodus|20|14|Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Exodus|20|15|Thou shalt not steal.
Exodus|20|16|Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Exodus|20|17|Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.
Exodus|20|18|And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
Exodus|20|19|And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
Exodus|20|20|And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
Exodus|20|21|And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus|20|22|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
Exodus|20|23|Ye shall not make {other gods} with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
Exodus|20|24|An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
Exodus|20|25|And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
Exodus|20|26|Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.
Exodus|21|1|Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.
Exodus|21|2|If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
Exodus|21|3|If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus|21|4|If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
Exodus|21|5|But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
Exodus|21|6|then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
Exodus|21|7|And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.
Exodus|21|8|If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
Exodus|21|9|And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
Exodus|21|10|If he take him another {wife}; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
Exodus|21|11|And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
