Genesis|14|7|And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis|14|8|And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis|14|9|against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Genesis|14|10|Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis|14|11|And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis|14|12|And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Genesis|14|13|And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
Genesis|14|14|And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
Genesis|14|15|And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis|14|16|And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Genesis|14|17|And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King’s Vale).
Genesis|14|18|And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
Genesis|14|19|And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis|14|20|and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
Genesis|14|21|And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis|14|22|And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis|14|23|that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis|14|24|save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.
Genesis|15|1|After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.
Genesis|15|2|And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
Genesis|15|3|And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis|15|4|And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Genesis|15|5|And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Genesis|15|6|And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
Genesis|15|7|And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Genesis|15|8|And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis|15|9|And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
Genesis|15|10|And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis|15|11|And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
Genesis|15|12|And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis|15|13|And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Genesis|15|14|and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Genesis|15|15|But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis|15|16|And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
Genesis|15|17|And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
Genesis|15|18|In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis|15|19|the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
Genesis|15|20|and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
Genesis|15|21|and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
Genesis|16|1|Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Genesis|16|2|And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis|16|3|And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
Genesis|16|4|And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis|16|5|And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee.
Genesis|16|6|But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.
Genesis|16|7|And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis|16|8|And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Genesis|16|9|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Genesis|16|10|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis|16|11|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis|16|12|And he shall be {as} a wild ass among men; his hand {shall be} against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.
Genesis|16|13|And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis|16|14|Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Genesis|16|15|And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis|16|16|And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Genesis|17|1|And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Genesis|17|2|And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Genesis|17|3|And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis|17|4|As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis|17|5|Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
Genesis|17|6|And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Genesis|17|7|And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
Genesis|17|8|And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Genesis|17|9|And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
Genesis|17|10|This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis|17|11|And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis|17|12|And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
Genesis|17|13|He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis|17|14|And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
Genesis|17|15|And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Genesis|17|16|And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be {a mother of} nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
Genesis|17|17|Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Genesis|17|18|And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
Genesis|17|19|And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
Genesis|17|20|And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis|17|21|But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
Genesis|17|22|And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis|17|23|And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Genesis|17|24|And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|25|And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|26|In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis|17|27|And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
Genesis|18|1|And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis|18|2|and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
Genesis|18|3|and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis|18|4|let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis|18|5|and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Genesis|18|6|And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
Genesis|18|7|And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis|18|8|And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Genesis|18|9|And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Genesis|18|10|And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis|18|11|Now Abraham and Sarah were old, {and} well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis|18|12|And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis|18|13|And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?
Genesis|18|14|Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
Genesis|18|15|Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Genesis|18|16|And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis|18|17|And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;
Genesis|18|18|seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
