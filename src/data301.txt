1 Samuel|30|31|and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
1 Samuel|31|1|Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|2|And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Samuel|31|3|And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
1 Samuel|31|4|Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
1 Samuel|31|5|And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.
1 Samuel|31|6|So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
1 Samuel|31|7|And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1 Samuel|31|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|9|And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.
1 Samuel|31|10|And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
1 Samuel|31|11|And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Samuel|31|12|all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
1 Samuel|31|13|And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Deuteronomy|1|1|These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
Deuteronomy|1|2|It is eleven days’ {journey} from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|3|And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them;
Deuteronomy|1|4|after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|1|5|Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|6|Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:
Deuteronomy|1|7|turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all {the places} nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy|1|8|Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
Deuteronomy|1|9|And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
Deuteronomy|1|10|Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy|1|11|Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!
Deuteronomy|1|12|How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
Deuteronomy|1|13|Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
Deuteronomy|1|14|And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good {for us} to do.
Deuteronomy|1|15|So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
Deuteronomy|1|16|And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear {the causes} between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.
Deuteronomy|1|17|Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.
Deuteronomy|1|18|And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Deuteronomy|1|19|And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|20|And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy|1|21|Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy|1|22|And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.
Deuteronomy|1|23|And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
Deuteronomy|1|24|and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
Deuteronomy|1|25|And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy|1|26|Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:
Deuteronomy|1|27|and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Deuteronomy|1|28|Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
Deuteronomy|1|29|Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy|1|30|Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
Deuteronomy|1|31|and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.
Deuteronomy|1|32|Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
Deuteronomy|1|33|who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
Deuteronomy|1|34|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|35|Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
Deuteronomy|1|36|save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|1|37|Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:
Deuteronomy|1|38|Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|1|39|Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy|1|40|But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Deuteronomy|1|41|Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|42|And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
Deuteronomy|1|43|So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|44|And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.
Deuteronomy|1|45|And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
Deuteronomy|1|46|So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode {there}.
Deuteronomy|2|1|Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.
Deuteronomy|2|2|And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|3|Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy|2|4|And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;
Deuteronomy|2|5|contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|6|Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
Deuteronomy|2|7|For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy|2|8|So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber.      And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy|2|9|And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|10|(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
Deuteronomy|2|11|these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy|2|12|The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.)
Deuteronomy|2|13|Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy|2|14|And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them.
Deuteronomy|2|15|Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
Deuteronomy|2|16|So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
Deuteronomy|2|17|that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|18|Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
Deuteronomy|2|19|and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|20|(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
Deuteronomy|2|21|a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;
Deuteronomy|2|22|as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
Deuteronomy|2|23|and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
Deuteronomy|2|24|Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy|2|25|This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
Deuteronomy|2|26|And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|27|Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left.
Deuteronomy|2|28|Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,
Deuteronomy|2|29|as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.
Deuteronomy|2|30|But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|2|31|And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
Deuteronomy|2|32|Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy|2|33|And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
Deuteronomy|2|34|And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:
Deuteronomy|2|35|only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
Deuteronomy|2|36|From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and {from} the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:
Deuteronomy|2|37|only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever Jehovah our God forbade us.
Deuteronomy|3|1|Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|3|2|And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
Deuteronomy|3|3|So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
