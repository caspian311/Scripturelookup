Judges|10|13|Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.
Judges|10|14|Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
Judges|10|15|And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
Judges|10|16|And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Jehovah; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
Judges|10|17|Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
Judges|10|18|And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges|11|1|Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
Judges|11|2|And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.
Judges|11|3|Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
Judges|11|4|And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
Judges|11|5|And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
Judges|11|6|and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|7|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
Judges|11|8|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges|11|9|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
Judges|11|10|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
Judges|11|11|Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spake all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
Judges|11|12|And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?
Judges|11|13|And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those {lands} again peaceably.
Judges|11|14|And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon;
Judges|11|15|and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
Judges|11|16|but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
Judges|11|17|then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
Judges|11|18|Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
Judges|11|19|And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
Judges|11|20|But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
Judges|11|21|And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
Judges|11|22|And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
Judges|11|23|So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?
Judges|11|24|Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
Judges|11|25|And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
Judges|11|26|While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?
Judges|11|27|I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|28|Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
Judges|11|29|Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|30|And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
Judges|11|31|then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
Judges|11|32|So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.
Judges|11|33|And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
Judges|11|34|And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
Judges|11|35|And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
Judges|11|36|And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|37|And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
Judges|11|38|And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
Judges|11|39|And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,
Judges|11|40|that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
Judges|12|1|And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
Judges|12|2|And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
Judges|12|3|And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
Judges|12|4|Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, {and} in the midst of Manasseh.
Judges|12|5|And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And it was so, that, when {any of} the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
Judges|12|6|then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth; for he could not frame to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
Judges|12|7|And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in {one of} the cities of Gilead.
Judges|12|8|And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
Judges|12|9|And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges|12|10|And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
Judges|12|11|And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges|12|12|And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
Judges|12|13|And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
Judges|12|14|And he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges|12|15|And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites.
Judges|13|1|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
Judges|13|2|And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
Judges|13|3|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
Judges|13|4|Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
Judges|13|5|for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
Judges|13|6|Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
Judges|13|7|but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.
Judges|13|8|Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
Judges|13|9|And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges|13|10|And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the {other} day.
Judges|13|11|And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
Judges|13|12|And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and {how} shall we do unto him?
Judges|13|13|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
Judges|13|14|She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
Judges|13|15|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
Judges|13|16|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|17|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?
Judges|13|18|And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
Judges|13|19|So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and {the angel} did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges|13|20|For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
Judges|13|21|But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|22|And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
Judges|13|23|But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
Judges|13|24|And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.
Judges|13|25|And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges|14|1|And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges|14|2|And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
Judges|14|3|Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
Judges|14|4|But his father and his mother knew not that it was of Jehovah; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
Judges|14|5|Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
Judges|14|6|And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges|14|7|And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
Judges|14|8|And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
Judges|14|9|And he took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
Judges|14|10|And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges|14|11|And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges|14|12|And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;
Judges|14|13|but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
Judges|14|14|And he said unto them,             Out of the eater came forth food,                   And out of the strong came forth sweetness.            And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
