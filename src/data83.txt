Luke|4|31|And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:
Luke|4|32|and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.
Luke|4|33|And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke|4|34|Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Luke|4|35|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.
Luke|4|36|And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
Luke|4|37|And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.
Luke|4|38|And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
Luke|4|39|And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.
Luke|4|40|And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
Luke|4|41|And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
Luke|4|42|And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.
Luke|4|43|But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.
Luke|4|44|And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
Luke|5|1|Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
Luke|5|2|and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
Luke|5|3|And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.
Luke|5|4|And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
Luke|5|5|And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.
Luke|5|6|And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;
Luke|5|7|and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke|5|8|But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
Luke|5|9|For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;
Luke|5|10|and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
Luke|5|11|And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.
Luke|5|12|And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Luke|5|13|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.
Luke|5|14|And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Luke|5|15|But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.
Luke|5|16|But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.
Luke|5|17|And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
Luke|5|18|And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
Luke|5|19|And not finding by what {way} they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
Luke|5|20|And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
Luke|5|21|And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
Luke|5|22|But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?
Luke|5|23|Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
Luke|5|24|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.
Luke|5|25|And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.
Luke|5|26|And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.
Luke|5|27|And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.
Luke|5|28|And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.
Luke|5|29|And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.
Luke|5|30|And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?
Luke|5|31|And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.
Luke|5|32|I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
Luke|5|33|And they said unto him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the {disciples} of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.
Luke|5|34|And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
Luke|5|35|But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.
Luke|5|36|And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.
Luke|5|37|And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.
Luke|5|38|But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.
Luke|5|39|And no man having drunk old {wine} desireth new; for he saith, The old is good.
Luke|6|1|Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
Luke|6|2|But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?
Luke|6|3|And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him;
Luke|6|4|how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?
Luke|6|5|And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
Luke|6|6|And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
Luke|6|7|And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.
Luke|6|8|But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
Luke|6|9|And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?
Luke|6|10|And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did {so}: and his hand was restored.
Luke|6|11|But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke|6|12|And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.
Luke|6|13|And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:
Luke|6|14|Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
Luke|6|15|and Matthew and Thomas, and James {the son} of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,
Luke|6|16|and Judas {the son} of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;
Luke|6|17|and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
Luke|6|18|and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
Luke|6|19|And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed {them} all.
Luke|6|20|And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed {are} ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke|6|21|Blessed {are} ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed {are} ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke|6|22|Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you {from their company}, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
Luke|6|23|Rejoice in that day, and leap {for joy}: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
Luke|6|24|But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Luke|6|25|Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger. Woe {unto you}, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke|6|26|Woe {unto you}, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.
Luke|6|27|But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
Luke|6|28|bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.
Luke|6|29|To him that smiteth thee on the {one} cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.
Luke|6|30|Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
Luke|6|31|And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
Luke|6|32|And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.
Luke|6|33|And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.
Luke|6|34|And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.
Luke|6|35|But love your enemies, and do {them} good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
Luke|6|36|Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
Luke|6|37|And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:
Luke|6|38|give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.
Luke|6|39|And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?
Luke|6|40|The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.
Luke|6|41|And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Luke|6|42|Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
Luke|6|43|For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.
Luke|6|44|For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
Luke|6|45|The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil {man} out of the evil {treasure} bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke|6|46|And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Luke|6|47|Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:
