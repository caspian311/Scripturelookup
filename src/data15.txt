Ezekiel|12|5|Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
Ezekiel|12|6|In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|7|And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel|12|8|And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|9|Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
Ezekiel|12|10|Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden {concerneth} the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.
Ezekiel|12|11|Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
Ezekiel|12|12|And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel|12|13|My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
Ezekiel|12|14|And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
Ezekiel|12|15|And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
Ezekiel|12|16|But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|17|Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|18|Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;
Ezekiel|12|19|and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, {and despoiled} of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
Ezekiel|12|20|And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|21|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|22|Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
Ezekiel|12|23|Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.
Ezekiel|12|24|For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|25|For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|26|Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|27|Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.
Ezekiel|12|28|Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|13|2|Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|13|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel|13|4|O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
Ezekiel|13|5|Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|6|They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.
Ezekiel|13|7|Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?
Ezekiel|13|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|9|And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|10|Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered {mortar}:
Ezekiel|13|11|say unto them that daub it with untempered {mortar}, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
Ezekiel|13|12|Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
Ezekiel|13|13|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
Ezekiel|13|14|So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered {mortar}, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|15|Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered {mortar}; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
Ezekiel|13|16|{to wit}, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|17|And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
Ezekiel|13|18|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of {persons of} every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
Ezekiel|13|19|And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.
Ezekiel|13|20|Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make {them} fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make {them} fly.
Ezekiel|13|21|Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|22|Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:
Ezekiel|13|23|Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|1|Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|14|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|3|Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?
Ezekiel|14|4|Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;
Ezekiel|14|5|that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
Ezekiel|14|6|Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
Ezekiel|14|7|For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:
Ezekiel|14|8|and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|9|And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
Ezekiel|14|10|And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh {unto him};
Ezekiel|14|11|that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|12|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|13|Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|14|though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|15|If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;
Ezekiel|14|16|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.
Ezekiel|14|17|Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|18|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.
Ezekiel|14|19|Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|20|though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
Ezekiel|14|21|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
Ezekiel|14|22|Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
Ezekiel|14|23|And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|15|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|15|2|Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel|15|3|Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Ezekiel|15|4|Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?
Ezekiel|15|5|Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!
Ezekiel|15|6|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel|15|7|And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.
Ezekiel|15|8|And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|1|Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|16|2|Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;
Ezekiel|16|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.
Ezekiel|16|4|And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
Ezekiel|16|5|No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.
Ezekiel|16|6|And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, {Though thou art} in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, {Though thou art} in thy blood, live.
Ezekiel|16|7|I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.
Ezekiel|16|8|Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine.
Ezekiel|16|9|Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
Ezekiel|16|10|I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.
Ezekiel|16|11|And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
Ezekiel|16|12|And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
Ezekiel|16|13|Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.
Ezekiel|16|14|And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|15|But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.
Ezekiel|16|16|And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: {the like things} shall not come, neither shall it be {so}.
Ezekiel|16|17|Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;
Ezekiel|16|18|and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
Ezekiel|16|19|My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and {thus} it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|20|Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
Ezekiel|16|21|that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through {the fire} unto them?
Ezekiel|16|22|And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.
