Exodus|39|11|and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond;
Exodus|39|12|and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;

Exodus|39|19|And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.
Exodus|39|20|And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.
Exodus|39|21|And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|22|And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
Exodus|39|23|And the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.
Exodus|39|24|And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, {and} twined {linen}.
