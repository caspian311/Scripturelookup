Ezekiel|7|8|Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|9|And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.
Ezekiel|7|10|Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
Ezekiel|7|11|Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them {shall remain}, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.
Ezekiel|7|12|The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|13|For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
Ezekiel|7|14|They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|15|The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
Ezekiel|7|16|But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|17|All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel|7|18|They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
Ezekiel|7|19|They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|20|As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations {and} their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.
Ezekiel|7|21|And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.
Ezekiel|7|22|My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret {place}; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.
Ezekiel|7|23|Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel|7|24|Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
Ezekiel|7|25|Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
Ezekiel|7|26|Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
Ezekiel|7|27|The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|8|1|And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
Ezekiel|8|2|Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
Ezekiel|8|3|And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner {court} that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
Ezekiel|8|4|And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
Ezekiel|8|5|Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
Ezekiel|8|6|And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.
Ezekiel|8|7|And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel|8|8|Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.
Ezekiel|8|9|And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.
Ezekiel|8|10|So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
Ezekiel|8|11|And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.
Ezekiel|8|12|Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.
Ezekiel|8|13|He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.
Ezekiel|8|14|Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel|8|15|Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.
Ezekiel|8|16|And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah’s house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.
Ezekiel|8|17|Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
Ezekiel|8|18|Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
Ezekiel|9|1|Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
Ezekiel|9|2|And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
Ezekiel|9|3|And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.
Ezekiel|9|4|And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|9|5|And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;
Ezekiel|9|6|slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.
Ezekiel|9|7|And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.
Ezekiel|9|8|And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
Ezekiel|9|9|Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wrestling {of judgment}: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.
Ezekiel|9|10|And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.
Ezekiel|9|11|And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
Ezekiel|10|1|Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
Ezekiel|10|2|And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling {wheels}, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
Ezekiel|10|3|Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
Ezekiel|10|4|And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, {and stood} over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.
Ezekiel|10|5|And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.
Ezekiel|10|6|And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|7|And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took {thereof}, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
Ezekiel|10|8|And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|9|And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.
Ezekiel|10|10|And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|11|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
Ezekiel|10|12|And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, {even} the wheels that they four had.
Ezekiel|10|13|As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling {wheels}.
Ezekiel|10|14|And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|10|15|And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
Ezekiel|10|16|And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.
Ezekiel|10|17|When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
Ezekiel|10|18|And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|19|And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|10|20|This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|21|Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|22|And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel|11|1|Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
Ezekiel|11|2|And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;
Ezekiel|11|3|that say, {The time} is not near to build houses: this {city} is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
Ezekiel|11|4|Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
Ezekiel|11|5|And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
Ezekiel|11|6|Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
Ezekiel|11|7|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this {city} is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.
Ezekiel|11|8|Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|9|And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
Ezekiel|11|10|Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|11|This {city} shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;
Ezekiel|11|12|and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.
Ezekiel|11|13|And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
Ezekiel|11|14|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|11|15|Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, {are they} unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.
Ezekiel|11|16|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.
Ezekiel|11|17|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|11|18|And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
Ezekiel|11|19|And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;
Ezekiel|11|20|that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|11|21|But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|22|Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|11|23|And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel|11|24|And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
Ezekiel|11|25|Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.
Ezekiel|12|1|The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|2|Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|3|Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|4|And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.
