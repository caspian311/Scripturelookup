Luke|10|31|And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|32|And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|33|But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
Luke|10|34|and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on {them} oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
Luke|10|35|And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.
Luke|10|36|Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?
Luke|10|37|And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
Luke|10|38|Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
Luke|10|39|And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.
Luke|10|40|But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
Luke|10|41|But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:
Luke|10|42|but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
Luke|11|1|And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
Luke|11|2|And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Luke|11|3|Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke|11|4|And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.
Luke|11|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
Luke|11|6|for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;
Luke|11|7|and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?
Luke|11|8|I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.
Luke|11|9|And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Luke|11|10|For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Luke|11|11|And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?
Luke|11|12|Or {if} he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
Luke|11|13|If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall {your} heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
Luke|11|14|And he was casting out a demon {that was} dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.
Luke|11|15|But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
Luke|11|16|And others, trying {him}, sought of him a sign from heaven.
Luke|11|17|But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house {divided} against a house falleth.
Luke|11|18|And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
Luke|11|19|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Luke|11|20|But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Luke|11|21|When the strong {man} fully armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace:
Luke|11|22|but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
Luke|11|23|He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Luke|11|24|The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out.
Luke|11|25|And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.
Luke|11|26|Then goeth he, and taketh {to him} seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
Luke|11|27|And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.
Luke|11|28|But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
Luke|11|29|And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
Luke|11|30|For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
Luke|11|31|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Luke|11|32|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Luke|11|33|No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light.
Luke|11|34|The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
Luke|11|35|Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.
Luke|11|36|If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.
Luke|11|37|Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
Luke|11|38|And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.
Luke|11|39|And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
Luke|11|40|Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?
Luke|11|41|But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.
Luke|11|42|But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Luke|11|43|Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.
Luke|11|44|Woe unto you! for ye are as the tombs which appear not, and the men that walk over {them} know it not.
Luke|11|45|And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.
Luke|11|46|And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke|11|47|Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luke|11|48|So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers: for they killed them, and ye build {their tombs}.
Luke|11|49|Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send unto them prophets and apostles; and {some} of them they shall kill and persecute;
Luke|11|50|that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
Luke|11|51|from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.
Luke|11|52|Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
Luke|11|53|And when he was come out from thence, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon {him} vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;
Luke|11|54|laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.
Luke|12|1|In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke|12|2|But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Luke|12|3|Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke|12|4|And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Luke|12|5|But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Luke|12|6|Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
Luke|12|7|But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke|12|8|And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
Luke|12|9|but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
Luke|12|10|And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.
Luke|12|11|And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
Luke|12|12|for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.
Luke|12|13|And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.
Luke|12|14|But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
Luke|12|15|And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
Luke|12|16|And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
Luke|12|17|and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits?
Luke|12|18|And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods.
Luke|12|19|And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
Luke|12|20|But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?
Luke|12|21|So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
Luke|12|22|And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for {your} life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
Luke|12|23|For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.
Luke|12|24|Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds!
Luke|12|25|And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?
Luke|12|26|If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest?
Luke|12|27|Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Luke|12|28|But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more {shall he clothe} you, O ye of little faith?
Luke|12|29|And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
Luke|12|30|For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke|12|31|Yet seek ye his kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you.
Luke|12|32|Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
Luke|12|33|Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth.
Luke|12|34|For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
