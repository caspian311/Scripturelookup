Luke|2|21|And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Luke|2|22|And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord
Luke|2|23|(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),
Luke|2|24|and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
Luke|2|25|And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke|2|26|And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke|2|27|And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,
Luke|2|28|then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
Luke|2|29|Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord,                   According to thy word, in peace;
Luke|2|30|For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
Luke|2|31|Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;
Luke|2|32|A light for revelation to the Gentiles,                   And the glory of thy people Israel.
Luke|2|33|And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;
Luke|2|34|and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this {child} is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;
Luke|2|35|yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.
Luke|2|36|And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
Luke|2|37|and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.
Luke|2|38|And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
Luke|2|39|And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
Luke|2|40|And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
Luke|2|41|And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
Luke|2|42|And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;
Luke|2|43|and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;
Luke|2|44|but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance:
Luke|2|45|and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.
Luke|2|46|And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:
Luke|2|47|and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
Luke|2|48|And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.
Luke|2|49|And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?
Luke|2|50|And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
Luke|2|51|And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all {these} sayings in her heart.
Luke|2|52|And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
Luke|3|1|Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke|3|2|in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
Luke|3|3|And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;
Luke|3|4|as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.
Luke|3|5|Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough ways smooth;
Luke|3|6|And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Luke|3|7|He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Luke|3|9|And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Luke|3|10|And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?
Luke|3|11|And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.
Luke|3|12|And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do?
Luke|3|13|And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.
Luke|3|14|And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse {any one} wrongfully; and be content with your wages.
Luke|3|15|And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;
Luke|3|16|John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and {in} fire:
Luke|3|17|whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Luke|3|18|With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people;
Luke|3|19|but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,
Luke|3|20|added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
Luke|3|21|Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
Luke|3|22|and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

Luke|4|1|And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness
Luke|4|2|during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered.
Luke|4|3|And the devil said unto him, if thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.
Luke|4|4|And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.
Luke|4|5|And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke|4|6|And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
Luke|4|7|If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine.
Luke|4|8|And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Luke|4|9|And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
Luke|4|10|for it is written,             He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to guard thee:
Luke|4|11|and,             On their hands they shall bear thee up,                   Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Luke|4|12|And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
Luke|4|13|And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him for a season.
Luke|4|14|And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about.
Luke|4|15|And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
Luke|4|16|And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.
Luke|4|17|And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
Luke|4|18|The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,                   Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor:                   He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives,                   And recovering of sight to the blind,                   To set at liberty them that are bruised,
Luke|4|19|To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
Luke|4|20|And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
Luke|4|21|And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.
Luke|4|22|And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
Luke|4|23|And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.
Luke|4|24|And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.
Luke|4|25|But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;
Luke|4|26|and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.
Luke|4|27|And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.
Luke|4|28|And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;
Luke|4|29|and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.
Luke|4|30|But he passing through the midst of them went his way.
