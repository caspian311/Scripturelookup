Deuteronomy|17|15|thou shalt surely set him king over thee, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother.
Deuteronomy|17|16|Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.
Deuteronomy|17|17|Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
Deuteronomy|17|18|And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of {that which is} before the priests the Levites:
Deuteronomy|17|19|and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;
Deuteronomy|17|20|that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
Deuteronomy|18|1|The priests the Levites, {even} all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.
Deuteronomy|18|2|And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.
Deuteronomy|18|3|And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
Deuteronomy|18|4|The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
Deuteronomy|18|5|For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever.
Deuteronomy|18|6|And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;
Deuteronomy|18|7|then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|18|8|They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
Deuteronomy|18|9|When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
Deuteronomy|18|10|There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
Deuteronomy|18|11|or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
Deuteronomy|18|12|For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|18|13|Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|18|14|For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
Deuteronomy|18|15|Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;
Deuteronomy|18|16|according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.
Deuteronomy|18|17|And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|18|18|I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
Deuteronomy|18|19|And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
Deuteronomy|18|20|But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
Deuteronomy|18|21|And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?
Deuteronomy|18|22|when a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.
Deuteronomy|19|1|When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
Deuteronomy|19|2|thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.
Deuteronomy|19|3|Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither.
Deuteronomy|19|4|And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;
Deuteronomy|19|5|as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:
Deuteronomy|19|6|lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
Deuteronomy|19|7|Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.
Deuteronomy|19|8|And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|19|9|if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
Deuteronomy|19|10|that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
Deuteronomy|19|11|But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;
Deuteronomy|19|12|then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
Deuteronomy|19|13|Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
Deuteronomy|19|14|Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.
Deuteronomy|19|15|One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
Deuteronomy|19|16|If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,
Deuteronomy|19|17|then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;
Deuteronomy|19|18|and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;
Deuteronomy|19|19|then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|19|20|And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|19|21|And thine eyes shall not pity; life {shall go} for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Deuteronomy|20|1|When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, {and} a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|20|2|And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
Deuteronomy|20|3|and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them;
Deuteronomy|20|4|for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
Deuteronomy|20|5|And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
Deuteronomy|20|6|And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof.
Deuteronomy|20|7|And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
Deuteronomy|20|8|And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart.
Deuteronomy|20|9|And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people.
Deuteronomy|20|10|When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
Deuteronomy|20|11|And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.
Deuteronomy|20|12|And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
Deuteronomy|20|13|and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
Deuteronomy|20|14|but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|20|15|Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
Deuteronomy|20|16|But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;
Deuteronomy|20|17|but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;
Deuteronomy|20|18|that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so would ye sin against Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|20|19|When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee?
Deuteronomy|20|20|Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.
Deuteronomy|21|1|If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;
Deuteronomy|21|2|then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:
Deuteronomy|21|3|and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
Deuteronomy|21|4|and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
Deuteronomy|21|5|And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
Deuteronomy|21|6|And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;
Deuteronomy|21|7|and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
Deuteronomy|21|8|Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood {to remain} in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
Deuteronomy|21|9|So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|21|10|When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,
Deuteronomy|21|11|and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;
Deuteronomy|21|12|then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
Deuteronomy|21|13|and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
Deuteronomy|21|14|And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.
Deuteronomy|21|15|If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;
Deuteronomy|21|16|then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:
Deuteronomy|21|17|but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.
Deuteronomy|21|18|If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;
Deuteronomy|21|19|then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
Deuteronomy|21|20|and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
Deuteronomy|21|21|And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
Deuteronomy|21|22|And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;
Deuteronomy|21|23|his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
Deuteronomy|22|1|Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother.
Deuteronomy|22|2|And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him.
Deuteronomy|22|3|And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself.
Deuteronomy|22|4|Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
Deuteronomy|22|5|A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|22|6|If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
Deuteronomy|22|7|thou shalt surely let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.
Deuteronomy|22|8|When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence.
