2 Samuel|9|1|And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
2 Samuel|9|2|And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
2 Samuel|9|3|And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
2 Samuel|9|4|And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|5|Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|6|And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!
2 Samuel|9|7|And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
2 Samuel|9|8|And he did obeisance, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2 Samuel|9|9|Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.
2 Samuel|9|10|And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in {the fruits}, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2 Samuel|9|11|Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, {said the king}, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|9|12|And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel|9|13|So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.
2 Samuel|10|1|And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2 Samuel|10|2|And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|3|But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
2 Samuel|10|4|So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
2 Samuel|10|5|When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
2 Samuel|10|6|And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
2 Samuel|10|7|And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
2 Samuel|10|8|And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
2 Samuel|10|9|Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
2 Samuel|10|10|And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|11|And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
2 Samuel|10|12|Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
2 Samuel|10|13|So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
2 Samuel|10|14|And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|10|15|And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2 Samuel|10|16|And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
2 Samuel|10|17|And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
2 Samuel|10|18|And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians {the men of} seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.
2 Samuel|10|19|And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
2 Samuel|11|1|And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out {to battle}, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|11|2|And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
2 Samuel|11|3|And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
2 Samuel|11|4|And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.
2 Samuel|11|5|And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
2 Samuel|11|6|And David sent to Joab, {saying}, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2 Samuel|11|7|And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
2 Samuel|11|8|And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess {of food} from the king.
2 Samuel|11|9|But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
2 Samuel|11|10|And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?
2 Samuel|11|11|And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
2 Samuel|11|12|And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
2 Samuel|11|13|And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
2 Samuel|11|14|And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel|11|15|And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
2 Samuel|11|16|And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.
2 Samuel|11|17|And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2 Samuel|11|18|Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel|11|19|and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,
2 Samuel|11|20|it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
2 Samuel|11|21|who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel|11|22|So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
2 Samuel|11|23|And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.
2 Samuel|11|24|And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel|11|25|Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
2 Samuel|11|26|And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
2 Samuel|11|27|And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Jehovah.
2 Samuel|12|1|And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
2 Samuel|12|2|The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;
2 Samuel|12|3|but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
2 Samuel|12|4|And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
2 Samuel|12|5|And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:
2 Samuel|12|6|and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2 Samuel|12|7|And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
2 Samuel|12|8|and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.
2 Samuel|12|9|Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|12|10|Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
2 Samuel|12|11|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
2 Samuel|12|12|For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
2 Samuel|12|13|And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
2 Samuel|12|14|Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
2 Samuel|12|15|And Nathan departed unto his house.      And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
2 Samuel|12|16|David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
2 Samuel|12|17|And the elders of his house arose, {and stood} beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
2 Samuel|12|18|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!
2 Samuel|12|19|But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
2 Samuel|12|20|Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
2 Samuel|12|21|Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
2 Samuel|12|22|And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?
2 Samuel|12|23|But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
2 Samuel|12|24|And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;
2 Samuel|12|25|and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah’s sake.
2 Samuel|12|26|Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
2 Samuel|12|27|And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.
2 Samuel|12|28|Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2 Samuel|12|29|And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
2 Samuel|12|30|And he took the crown of their king from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and {in it were} precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
2 Samuel|12|31|And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|13|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2 Samuel|13|2|And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.
2 Samuel|13|3|But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
2 Samuel|13|4|And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
2 Samuel|13|5|And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
2 Samuel|13|6|So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
2 Samuel|13|7|Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.
2 Samuel|13|8|So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
2 Samuel|13|9|And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
2 Samuel|13|10|And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
