Acts|2|33|Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.
Acts|2|34|For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself,             The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
Acts|2|35|Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Acts|2|36|Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
Acts|2|37|Now when they heard {this,} they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
Acts|2|38|And Peter {said} unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|2|39|For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, {even} as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.
Acts|2|40|And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
Acts|2|41|They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added {unto them} in that day about three thousand souls.
Acts|2|42|And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
Acts|2|43|And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
Acts|2|44|And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
Acts|2|45|and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.
Acts|2|46|And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
Acts|2|47|praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those that were saved.
Acts|3|1|Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, {being} the ninth {hour}.
Acts|3|2|And a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
Acts|3|3|who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.
Acts|3|4|And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.
Acts|3|5|And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts|3|6|But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.
Acts|3|7|And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength.
Acts|3|8|And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
Acts|3|9|And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Acts|3|10|and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
Acts|3|11|And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
Acts|3|12|And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?
Acts|3|13|The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.
Acts|3|14|But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you,
Acts|3|15|and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
Acts|3|16|And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
Acts|3|17|And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
Acts|3|18|But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
Acts|3|19|Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;
Acts|3|20|and that he may send the Christ who hath been appointed for you, {even} Jesus:
Acts|3|21|whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old.
Acts|3|22|Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me. To him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.
Acts|3|23|And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Acts|3|24|Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
Acts|3|25|Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Acts|3|26|Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
Acts|4|1|And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
Acts|4|2|being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts|4|3|And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.
Acts|4|4|But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
Acts|4|5|And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
Acts|4|6|and Annas the high priest {was there}, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
Acts|4|7|And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?
Acts|4|8|Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,
Acts|4|9|if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;
Acts|4|10|be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, {even} in him doth this man stand here before you whole.
Acts|4|11|He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.
Acts|4|12|And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.
Acts|4|13|Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
Acts|4|14|And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
Acts|4|15|But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
Acts|4|16|saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
Acts|4|17|But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
Acts|4|18|And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Acts|4|19|But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:
Acts|4|20|for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.
Acts|4|21|And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.
Acts|4|22|For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.
Acts|4|23|And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.
Acts|4|24|And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:
Acts|4|25|who by the Holy Spirit, {by} the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say,             Why did the Gentiles rage,                   And the peoples imagine vain things?
Acts|4|26|The kings of the earth set themselves in array,                   And the rulers were gathered together,                   Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:
Acts|4|27|for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,
Acts|4|28|to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.
Acts|4|29|And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,
Acts|4|30|while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.
Acts|4|31|And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
Acts|4|32|And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one {of them} said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
Acts|4|33|And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Acts|4|34|For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
Acts|4|35|and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.
Acts|4|36|And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,
Acts|4|37|having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts|5|1|But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
Acts|5|2|and kept back {part} of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts|5|3|But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back {part} of the price of the land?
Acts|5|4|While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto God.
Acts|5|5|And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it.
Acts|5|6|And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.
Acts|5|7|And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
Acts|5|8|And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much.
Acts|5|9|But Peter {said} unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
Acts|5|10|And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
Acts|5|11|And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.
Acts|5|12|And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
Acts|5|13|But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them;
Acts|5|14|and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;
Acts|5|15|insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.
Acts|5|16|And there also came together the multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
Acts|5|17|But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
Acts|5|18|and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.
Acts|5|19|But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,
Acts|5|20|Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.
Acts|5|21|And when they heard {this}, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.
Acts|5|22|But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told,
