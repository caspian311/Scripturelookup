Isaiah|51|22|Thus saith thy Lord Jehovah, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again:

Isaiah|53|1|Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?

Isaiah|53|3|He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.
