Luke|6|48|he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.
Luke|6|49|But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.
Luke|7|1|After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
Luke|7|2|And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.
Luke|7|3|And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.
Luke|7|4|And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him;
Luke|7|5|for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.
Luke|7|6|And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:
Luke|7|7|wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Luke|7|8|For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Luke|7|9|And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Luke|7|10|And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
Luke|7|11|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.
Luke|7|12|Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
Luke|7|13|And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
Luke|7|14|And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
Luke|7|15|And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
Luke|7|16|And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.
Luke|7|17|And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about.
Luke|7|18|And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
Luke|7|19|And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|20|And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|21|In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.
Luke|7|22|And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Luke|7|23|And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
Luke|7|24|And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Luke|7|25|But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
Luke|7|26|But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke|7|27|This is he of whom it is written,             Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,                   Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Luke|7|28|I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Luke|7|29|And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke|7|30|But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.
Luke|7|31|Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?
Luke|7|32|They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.
Luke|7|33|For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
Luke|7|34|The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
Luke|7|35|And wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke|7|36|And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
Luke|7|37|And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,
Luke|7|38|and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke|7|39|Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
Luke|7|40|And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.
Luke|7|41|A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.
Luke|7|42|When they had not {wherewith} to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?
Luke|7|43|Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
Luke|7|44|And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
Luke|7|45|Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke|7|46|My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke|7|47|Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, {the same} loveth little.
Luke|7|48|And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
Luke|7|49|And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?
Luke|7|50|And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
Luke|8|1|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,
Luke|8|2|and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke|8|3|and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.
Luke|8|4|And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:
Luke|8|5|The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.
Luke|8|6|And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
Luke|8|7|And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
Luke|8|8|And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|8|9|And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.
Luke|8|10|And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
Luke|8|11|Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke|8|12|And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
Luke|8|13|And those on the rock {are} they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luke|8|14|And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of {this} life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luke|8|15|And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.
Luke|8|16|And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.
Luke|8|17|For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor {anything} secret, that shall not be known and come to light.
Luke|8|18|Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.
Luke|8|19|And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.
Luke|8|20|And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
Luke|8|21|But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.
Luke|8|22|Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.
Luke|8|23|But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling {with water}, and were in jeopardy.
Luke|8|24|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke|8|25|And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?
Luke|8|26|And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luke|8|27|And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in {any} house, but in the tombs.
Luke|8|28|And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luke|8|29|For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.
Luke|8|30|And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.
Luke|8|31|And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.
Luke|8|32|Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.
Luke|8|33|And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.
Luke|8|34|And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
Luke|8|35|And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.
Luke|8|36|And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.
Luke|8|37|And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them, for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.
Luke|8|38|But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,
Luke|8|39|Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.
Luke|8|40|And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.
Luke|8|41|And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;
Luke|8|42|for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.
Luke|8|43|And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,
Luke|8|44|came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.
Luke|8|45|And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush {thee}.
Luke|8|46|But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.
Luke|8|47|And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luke|8|48|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
