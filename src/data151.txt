Zephaniah|3|5|Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
Zephaniah|3|6|I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|3|7|I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, {according to} all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
Zephaniah|3|8|Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
Zephaniah|3|9|For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.
Zephaniah|3|10|From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
Zephaniah|3|11|In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
Zephaniah|3|12|But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.
Zephaniah|3|13|The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
Zephaniah|3|14|Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
Zephaniah|3|15|Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.
Zephaniah|3|16|In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
Zephaniah|3|17|Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.
Zephaniah|3|18|I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; {to whom} the burden upon her was a reproach.
Zephaniah|3|19|Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.
Zephaniah|3|20|At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.
Ecclesiastes|1|1|The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|2|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|1|3|What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|1|4|One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecclesiastes|1|5|The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.
Ecclesiastes|1|6|The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.
Ecclesiastes|1|7|All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.
Ecclesiastes|1|8|All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter {it}: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes|1|9|That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|1|10|Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
Ecclesiastes|1|11|There is no remembrance of the former {generations}; neither shall there be any remembrance of the latter {generations} that are to come, among those that shall come after.
Ecclesiastes|1|12|I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|13|And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|1|14|I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|15|That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecclesiastes|1|16|I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
Ecclesiastes|1|17|And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|18|For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
Ecclesiastes|2|1|I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|2|I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?
Ecclesiastes|2|3|I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding {me} with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
Ecclesiastes|2|4|I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
Ecclesiastes|2|5|I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;
Ecclesiastes|2|6|I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;
Ecclesiastes|2|7|I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;
Ecclesiastes|2|8|I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
Ecclesiastes|2|9|So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
Ecclesiastes|2|10|And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.
Ecclesiastes|2|11|Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|12|And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what {can} the man {do} that cometh after the king? {even} that which hath been done long ago.
Ecclesiastes|2|13|Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
Ecclesiastes|2|14|The wise manâ€™s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes|2|15|Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|16|For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!
Ecclesiastes|2|17|So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|2|18|And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
Ecclesiastes|2|19|And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|20|Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|21|For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes|2|22|For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|2|23|For all his days are {but} sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|24|There is nothing better for a man {than} that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes|2|25|For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
Ecclesiastes|2|26|For to the man that pleaseth him {God} giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|3|1|For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
Ecclesiastes|3|2|a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
Ecclesiastes|3|3|a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
Ecclesiastes|3|4|a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
Ecclesiastes|3|5|a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
Ecclesiastes|3|6|a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
Ecclesiastes|3|7|a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
Ecclesiastes|3|8|a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes|3|9|What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
Ecclesiastes|3|10|I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|3|11|He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.
Ecclesiastes|3|12|I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.
Ecclesiastes|3|13|And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes|3|14|I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.
Ecclesiastes|3|15|That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.
Ecclesiastes|3|16|And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
Ecclesiastes|3|17|I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes|3|18|I said in my heart, {It is} because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are {but as} beasts.
Ecclesiastes|3|19|For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|3|20|All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes|3|21|Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes|3|22|Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him {back} to see what shall be after him?
Ecclesiastes|4|1|Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
Ecclesiastes|4|2|Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;
Ecclesiastes|4|3|yea, better than them both {did I esteem} him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|4|Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|5|The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes|4|6|Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|7|Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|8|There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, {saith he}, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
Ecclesiastes|4|9|Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
Ecclesiastes|4|10|For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.
Ecclesiastes|4|11|Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm {alone}?
Ecclesiastes|4|12|And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes|4|13|Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
Ecclesiastes|4|14|For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.
Ecclesiastes|4|15|I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.
Ecclesiastes|4|16|There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|5|1|Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.
Ecclesiastes|5|2|Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
