Proverbs|1|30|They would none of my counsel;                   They despised all my reproof.
Proverbs|1|31|Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,                   And be filled with their own devices.
Proverbs|1|32|For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them,                   And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.
Proverbs|1|33|But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,                   And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
Proverbs|2|1|My son, if thou wilt receive my words,                   And lay up my commandments with thee;
Proverbs|2|2|So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom,                   And apply thy heart to understanding;
Proverbs|2|3|Yea, if thou cry after discernment,                   And lift up thy voice for understanding;
Proverbs|2|4|If thou seek her as silver,                   And search for her as for hid treasures:
Proverbs|2|5|Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah,                   And find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs|2|6|For Jehovah giveth wisdom;                   Out of his mouth {cometh} knowledge and understanding:
Proverbs|2|7|He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright;                           {He is} a shield to them that walk in integrity;
Proverbs|2|8|That he may guard the paths of justice,                   And preserve the way of his saints.
Proverbs|2|9|Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,                   And equity, {yea}, every good path.
Proverbs|2|10|For wisdom shall enter into thy heart,                   And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
Proverbs|2|11|Discretion shall watch over thee;                   Understanding shall keep thee:
Proverbs|2|12|To deliver thee from the way of evil,                   From the men that speak perverse things;
Proverbs|2|13|Who forsake the paths of uprightness,                   To walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs|2|14|Who rejoice to do evil,                   And delight in the perverseness of evil;
Proverbs|2|15|Who are crooked in their ways,                   And wayward in their paths:
Proverbs|2|16|To deliver thee from the strange woman,                   Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
Proverbs|2|17|That forsaketh the friend of her youth,                   And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
Proverbs|2|18|For her house inclineth unto death,                   And her paths unto the dead;
Proverbs|2|19|None that go unto her return again,                   Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
Proverbs|2|20|That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,                   And keep the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs|2|21|For the upright shall dwell in the land,                   And the perfect shall remain in it.
Proverbs|2|22|But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,                   And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
Proverbs|3|1|My son, forget not my law;                   But let thy heart keep my commandments:
Proverbs|3|2|For length of days, and years of life,                   And peace, will they add to thee.
Proverbs|3|3|Let not kindness and truth forsake thee:                   Bind them about thy neck;                   Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
Proverbs|3|4|So shalt thou find favor and good understanding                   In the sight of God and man.
Proverbs|3|5|Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart,                   And lean not upon thine own understanding:
Proverbs|3|6|In all thy ways acknowledge him,                   And he will direct thy paths.
Proverbs|3|7|Be not wise in thine own eyes;                   Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:
Proverbs|3|8|It will be health to thy navel,                   And marrow to thy bones.
Proverbs|3|9|Honor Jehovah with thy substance,                   And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:
Proverbs|3|10|So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,                   And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
Proverbs|3|11|My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah;                   Neither be weary of his reproof:
Proverbs|3|12|For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth;                   Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Proverbs|3|13|Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,                   And the man that getteth understanding.
Proverbs|3|14|For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,                   And the profit thereof than fine gold.
Proverbs|3|15|She is more precious than rubies:                   And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.
Proverbs|3|16|Length of days is in her right hand;                   In her left hand are riches and honor.
Proverbs|3|17|Her ways are ways of pleasantness,                   And all her paths are peace.
Proverbs|3|18|She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:                   And happy is every one that retaineth her.
Proverbs|3|19|Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth;                   By understanding he established the heavens.
Proverbs|3|20|By his knowledge the depths were broken up,                   And the skies drop down the dew.
Proverbs|3|21|My son, let them not depart from thine eyes;                   Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Proverbs|3|22|So shall they be life unto thy soul,                   And grace to thy neck.
Proverbs|3|23|Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely,                   And thy foot shall not stumble.
Proverbs|3|24|When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:                   Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Proverbs|3|25|Be not afraid of sudden fear,                   Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
Proverbs|3|26|For Jehovah will be thy confidence,                   And will keep thy foot from being taken.
Proverbs|3|27|Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,                   When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
Proverbs|3|28|Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again,                   And to-morrow I will give;                   When thou hast it by thee.
Proverbs|3|29|Devise not evil against thy neighbor,                   Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Proverbs|3|30|Strive not with a man without cause,                   If he have done thee no harm.
Proverbs|3|31|Envy thou not the man of violence,                   And choose none of his ways.
Proverbs|3|32|For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah;                   But his friendship is with the upright.
Proverbs|3|33|The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked;                   But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
Proverbs|3|34|Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers;                   But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Proverbs|3|35|The wise shall inherit glory;                   But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Proverbs|4|1|Hear, {my} sons, the instruction of a father,                   And attend to know understanding:
Proverbs|4|2|For I give you good doctrine;                   Forsake ye not my law.
Proverbs|4|3|For I was a son unto my father,                   Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Proverbs|4|4|And he taught me, and said unto me:                   Let thy heart retain my words;                   Keep my commandments, and live;
Proverbs|4|5|Get wisdom, get understanding;                   Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;

Proverbs|4|14|Enter not into the path of the wicked,                   And walk not in the way of evil men.
Proverbs|4|15|Avoid it, pass not by it;                   Turn from it, and pass on.
Proverbs|4|16|For they sleep not, except they do evil;                   And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Proverbs|4|17|For they eat the bread of wickedness,                   And drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs|4|18|But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light,                   That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Proverbs|4|19|The way of the wicked is as darkness:                   They know not at what they stumble.

Proverbs|4|21|Let them not depart from thine eyes;                   Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
Proverbs|4|22|For they are life unto those that find them,                   And health to all their flesh.
Proverbs|4|23|Keep thy heart with all diligence;                   For out of it are the issues of life.
Proverbs|4|24|Put away from thee a wayward mouth,                   And perverse lips put far from thee.

Proverbs|5|1|My son, attend unto my wisdom;                   Incline thine ear to my understanding:
Proverbs|5|2|That thou mayest preserve discretion,                   And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Proverbs|5|3|For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,                   And her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs|5|4|But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,                   Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs|5|5|Her feet go down to death;                   Her steps take hold on Sheol;
Proverbs|5|6|So that she findeth not the level path of life:                   Her ways are unstable, {and} she knoweth {it} not.
Proverbs|5|7|Now therefore, {my} sons, hearken unto me,                   And depart not from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs|5|8|Remove thy way far from her,                   And come not nigh the door of her house;
Proverbs|5|9|Lest thou give thine honor unto others,                   And thy years unto the cruel;
Proverbs|5|10|Lest strangers be filled with thy strength,                   And thy labors {be} in the house of an alien,
Proverbs|5|11|And thou mourn at thy latter end,                   When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Proverbs|5|12|And say, How have I hated instruction,                   And my heart despised reproof;
