Isaiah|28|26|For his God doth instruct him aright, {and} doth teach him.
Isaiah|28|27|For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp {threshing} instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
Isaiah|28|28|Bread {grain} is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.
Isaiah|28|29|This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
Isaiah|29|1|Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:

Isaiah|29|5|But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.
Isaiah|29|6|She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
Isaiah|29|7|And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
Isaiah|29|8|And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
Isaiah|29|9|Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.

Isaiah|29|13|And the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh {unto me}, and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught {them};
Isaiah|29|14|therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
Isaiah|29|15|Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
Isaiah|29|16|Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?
Isaiah|29|17|Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
Isaiah|29|18|And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
Isaiah|29|19|The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|29|20|For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;
Isaiah|29|21|that make a man an offender in {his} cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.

Isaiah|30|1|Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,
Isaiah|30|2|that set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah|30|3|Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
Isaiah|30|4|For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors are come to Hanes.
Isaiah|30|5|They shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
Isaiah|30|6|The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit {them}.
Isaiah|30|7|For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.
Isaiah|30|8|Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
Isaiah|30|9|For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;
Isaiah|30|10|that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,
Isaiah|30|11|get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
Isaiah|30|12|Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;
Isaiah|30|13|therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.
Isaiah|30|14|And he shall break it as a potterâ€™s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.
Isaiah|30|15|For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:
Isaiah|30|16|but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
Isaiah|30|17|One thousand {shall flee} at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
Isaiah|30|18|And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.
Isaiah|30|19|For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.
Isaiah|30|20|And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;

Isaiah|30|22|And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
Isaiah|30|23|And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;
Isaiah|30|24|the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
Isaiah|30|25|And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill, brooks {and} streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Isaiah|30|26|Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
Isaiah|30|27|Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;
Isaiah|30|28|and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err {shall be} in the jaws of the peoples.
Isaiah|30|29|Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.

Isaiah|31|1|Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!
Isaiah|31|2|Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
Isaiah|31|3|Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.
Isaiah|31|4|For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.

Isaiah|32|4|And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
Isaiah|32|5|The fool shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
Isaiah|32|6|For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
Isaiah|32|7|And the instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.

Isaiah|32|13|Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

Isaiah|32|15|until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.

Isaiah|33|10|Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.
