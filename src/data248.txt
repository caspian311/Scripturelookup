Job|24|7|They lie all night naked without clothing,                   And have no covering in the cold.
Job|24|8|They are wet with the showers of the mountains,                   And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
Job|24|9|There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,                   And take a pledge of the poor;
Job|24|10|{So that} they go about naked without clothing,                   And being hungry they carry the sheaves.
Job|24|11|They make oil within the walls of these men;                    They tread {their} winepresses, and suffer thirst.
Job|24|12|From out of the populous city men groan,                    And the soul of the wounded crieth out:                    Yet God regardeth not the folly.
Job|24|13|These are of them that rebel against the light;                   They know not the ways thereof,                   Nor abide in the paths thereof.
Job|24|14|The murderer riseth with the light;                   He killeth the poor and needy;                   And in the night he is as a thief.
Job|24|15|The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,                   Saying, No eye shall see me:                   And he disguiseth his face.
Job|24|16|In the dark they dig through houses:                   They shut themselves up in the day-time;                   They know not the light.
Job|24|17|For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness;                   For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
Job|24|18|Swiftly they {pass away} upon the face of the waters;                   Their portion is cursed in the earth:                   They turn not into the way of the vineyards.
Job|24|19|Drought and heat consume the snow waters:                           {So doth} Sheol {those that} have sinned.
Job|24|20|The womb shall forget him;                   The worm shall feed sweetly on him;                   He shall be no more remembered;                   And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
Job|24|21|He devoureth the barren that beareth not,                   And doeth not good to the widow.
Job|24|22|Yet {God} preserveth the mighty by his power:                   He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.
Job|24|23|{God} giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon;                   And his eyes are upon their ways.
Job|24|24|They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;                   Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,                   And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
Job|24|25|And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,                   And make my speech nothing worth?
Job|25|1|Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|25|2|Dominion and fear are with him;                   He maketh peace in his high places.
Job|25|3|Is there any number of his armies?                   And upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job|25|4|How then can man be just with God?                   Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job|25|5|Behold, even the moon hath no brightness,                   And the stars are not pure in his sight:
Job|25|6|How much less man, that is a worm!                   And the son of man, that is a worm!
Job|26|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|26|2|How hast thou helped him that is without power!                   How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
Job|26|3|How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,                   And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
Job|26|4|To whom hast thou uttered words?                   And whose spirit came forth from thee?
Job|26|5|They that are deceased tremble                   Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
Job|26|6|Sheol is naked before {God},                   And Abaddon hath no covering.
Job|26|7|He stretcheth out the north over empty space,                   And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
Job|26|8|He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;                   And the cloud is not rent under them.
Job|26|9|He incloseth the face of his throne,                   And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
Job|26|10|He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters,                   Unto the confines of light and darkness.
Job|26|11|The pillars of heaven tremble                   And are astonished at his rebuke.
Job|26|12|He stirreth up the sea with his power,                   And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
Job|26|13|By his Spirit the heavens are garnished;                   His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
Job|26|14|Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways:                   And how small a whisper do we hear of him!                   But the thunder of his power who can understand?
Job|27|1|And Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job|27|2|As God liveth, who hath taken away my right,                   And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:
Job|27|3|(For my life is yet whole in me,                   And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
Job|27|4|Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,                   Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
Job|27|5|Far be it from me that I should justify you:                   Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
Job|27|6|My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:                   My heart shall not reproach {me} so long as I live.
Job|27|7|Let mine enemy be as the wicked,                   And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
Job|27|8|For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain,                   When God taketh away his soul?
Job|27|9|Will God hear his cry,                   When trouble cometh upon him?
Job|27|10|Will he delight himself in the Almighty,                   And call upon God at all times?
Job|27|11|I will teach you concerning the hand of God;                   That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job|27|12|Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;                   Why then are ye become altogether vain?
Job|27|13|This is the portion of a wicked man with God,                   And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:
Job|27|14|If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;                   And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Job|27|15|Those that remain of him shall be buried in death,                   And his widows shall make no lamentation.
Job|27|16|Though he heap up silver as the dust,                   And prepare raiment as the clay;
Job|27|17|He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,                   And the innocent shall divide the silver.
Job|27|18|He buildeth his house as the moth,                   And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
Job|27|19|He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered {to his fathers};                   He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
Job|27|20|Terrors overtake him like waters;                   A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job|27|21|The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;                   And it sweepeth him out of his place.
Job|27|22|For {God} shall hurl at him, and not spare:                   He would fain flee out of his hand.
Job|27|23|Men shall clap their hands at him,                   And shall hiss him out of his place.
Job|28|1|Surely there is a mine for silver,                    And a place for gold which they refine.
Job|28|2|Iron is taken out of the earth,                   And copper is molten out of the stone.
Job|28|3|{Man} setteth an end to darkness,                   And searcheth out, to the furthest bound,                   The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
Job|28|4|He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;                   They are forgotten of the foot;                   They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
Job|28|5|As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;                   And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
Job|28|6|The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,                   And it hath dust of gold.
Job|28|7|That path no bird of prey knoweth,                   Neither hath the falconâ€™s eye seen it:
Job|28|8|The proud beasts have not trodden it,                   Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.
Job|28|9|He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;                   He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job|28|10|He cutteth out channels among the rocks;                   And his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job|28|11|He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;                    And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job|28|12|But where shall wisdom be found?                   And where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|13|Man knoweth not the price thereof;                   Neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job|28|14|The deep saith, It is not in me;                   And the sea saith, It is not with me.
Job|28|15|It cannot be gotten for gold,                   Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
Job|28|16|It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,                   With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
Job|28|17|Gold and glass cannot equal it,                   Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
Job|28|18|No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:                   Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
Job|28|19|The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,                   Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Job|28|20|Whence then cometh wisdom?                   And where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|21|Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,                   And kept close from the birds of the heavens.
Job|28|22|Destruction and Death say,                   We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.
Job|28|23|God understandeth the way thereof,                   And he knoweth the place thereof.
Job|28|24|For he looketh to the ends of the earth,                   And seeth under the whole heaven;
Job|28|25|To make a weight for the wind:                   Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.
Job|28|26|When he made a decree for the rain,                   And a way for the lightning of the thunder;
Job|28|27|Then did he see it, and declare it;                   He established it, yea, and searched it out.
Job|28|28|And unto man he said,                   Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;                   And to depart from evil is understanding.
Job|29|1|And Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job|29|2|Oh that I were as in the months of old,                   As in the days when God watched over me;
Job|29|3|When his lamp shined upon my head,                   And by his light I walked through darkness;
Job|29|4|As I was in the ripeness of my days,                   When the friendship of God was upon my tent;
Job|29|5|When the Almighty was yet with me,                   And my children were about me;
Job|29|6|When my steps were washed with butter,                   And the rock poured me out streams of oil!
Job|29|7|When I went forth to the gate unto the city,                   When I prepared my seat in the street,
Job|29|8|The young men saw me and hid themselves,                   And the aged rose up and stood;
Job|29|9|The princes refrained from talking,                   And laid their hand on their mouth;
Job|29|10|The voice of the nobles was hushed,                   And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
