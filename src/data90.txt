Luke|20|15|And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
Luke|20|16|He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
Luke|20|17|But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written,             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner?
Luke|20|18|Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Luke|20|19|And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.
Luke|20|20|And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
Luke|20|21|And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person {of any}, but of a truth teachest the way of God:
Luke|20|22|Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Luke|20|23|But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,
Luke|20|24|Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.
Luke|20|25|And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.
Luke|20|26|And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
Luke|20|27|And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;
Luke|20|28|and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Luke|20|29|There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;
Luke|20|30|and the second:
Luke|20|31|and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
Luke|20|32|Afterward the woman also died.
Luke|20|33|In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
Luke|20|34|And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
Luke|20|35|but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke|20|36|for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
Luke|20|37|But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in {the place concerning} the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke|20|38|Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
Luke|20|39|And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
Luke|20|40|For they durst not any more ask him any question.
Luke|20|41|And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?
Luke|20|42|For David himself saith in the book of Psalms,             The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,
Luke|20|43|Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Luke|20|44|David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?
Luke|20|45|And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,
Luke|20|46|Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;
Luke|20|47|who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.
Luke|21|1|And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke|21|2|And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke|21|3|And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all:
Luke|21|4|for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.
Luke|21|5|And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said,
Luke|21|6|As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Luke|21|7|And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these things be? and what {shall be} the sign when these things are about to come to pass?
Luke|21|8|And he said, Take heed that ye be not led astray: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am {he}; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them.
Luke|21|9|And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.
Luke|21|10|Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
Luke|21|11|and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.
Luke|21|12|But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|13|It shall turn out unto you for a testimony.
Luke|21|14|Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer:
Luke|21|15|for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay.
Luke|21|16|But ye shall be delivered up even by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolk, and friends; and {some} of you shall they cause to be put to death.
Luke|21|17|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|18|And not a hair of your head shall perish.
Luke|21|19|In your patience ye shall win your souls.
Luke|21|20|But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.
Luke|21|21|Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein.
Luke|21|22|For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
Luke|21|23|Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people.
Luke|21|24|And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
Luke|21|25|And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows;
Luke|21|26|men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
Luke|21|27|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke|21|28|But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.
Luke|21|29|And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees:
Luke|21|30|when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh.
Luke|21|31|Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.
Luke|21|32|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished.
Luke|21|33|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke|21|34|But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare:
Luke|21|35|for {so} shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.
Luke|21|36|But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
Luke|21|37|And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet.
Luke|21|38|And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
Luke|22|1|Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
Luke|22|2|And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.
Luke|22|3|And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
Luke|22|4|And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them.
Luke|22|5|And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
Luke|22|6|And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Luke|22|7|And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed.
Luke|22|8|And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat.
Luke|22|9|And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready?
Luke|22|10|And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.
Luke|22|11|And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Luke|22|12|And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke|22|13|And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Luke|22|14|And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.
Luke|22|15|And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
Luke|22|16|for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke|22|17|And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
Luke|22|18|for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
Luke|22|19|And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Luke|22|20|And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, {even} that which is poured out for you.
Luke|22|21|But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
Luke|22|22|For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!
Luke|22|23|And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
Luke|22|24|And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.
Luke|22|25|And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.
Luke|22|26|But ye {shall} not {be} so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
Luke|22|27|For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
Luke|22|28|But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;
Luke|22|29|and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,
