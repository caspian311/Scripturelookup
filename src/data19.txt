Ezekiel|25|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:
Ezekiel|25|3|and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:
Ezekiel|25|4|therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
Ezekiel|25|5|And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|6|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|25|7|therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|8|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;
Ezekiel|25|9|therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
Ezekiel|25|10|unto the children of the east, {to go} against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
Ezekiel|25|11|and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|12|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
Ezekiel|25|13|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
Ezekiel|25|14|And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;
Ezekiel|25|16|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
Ezekiel|25|17|And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
Ezekiel|26|1|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|26|2|Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken {that was} the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:
Ezekiel|26|3|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
Ezekiel|26|4|And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel|26|5|She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
Ezekiel|26|6|And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|7|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people.
Ezekiel|26|8|He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.
Ezekiel|26|9|And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
Ezekiel|26|10|By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
Ezekiel|26|11|With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.
Ezekiel|26|12|And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
Ezekiel|26|13|And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
Ezekiel|26|14|And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
Ezekiel|26|16|Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.
Ezekiel|26|17|And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there!
Ezekiel|26|18|Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.
Ezekiel|26|19|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;
Ezekiel|26|20|then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living:
Ezekiel|26|21|I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt no more have any being; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|27|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|27|2|And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
Ezekiel|27|3|and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|27|4|Thy borders are in the heart of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|5|They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
Ezekiel|27|6|Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.
Ezekiel|27|7|Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.
Ezekiel|27|8|The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots.
Ezekiel|27|9|The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|10|Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
Ezekiel|27|11|The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|12|Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.

Ezekiel|27|23|Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur {and} Chilmad, were thy traffickers.
Ezekiel|27|24|These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|25|The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|27|26|Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|27|27|Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
Ezekiel|27|28|At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.
Ezekiel|27|29|And all that handled the oar, the mariners, {and} all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,
Ezekiel|27|30|and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
Ezekiel|27|31|and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.
Ezekiel|27|32|And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, {saying}, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
Ezekiel|27|33|When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|34|In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee.
Ezekiel|27|35|All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.
Ezekiel|27|36|The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.
Ezekiel|28|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|2|Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of God;-
Ezekiel|28|3|behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee;
Ezekiel|28|4|by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;
Ezekiel|28|5|by thy great wisdom {and} by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;-
Ezekiel|28|6|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God,
Ezekiel|28|7|therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
Ezekiel|28|8|They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|28|9|Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.
Ezekiel|28|10|Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|12|Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|28|13|Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared.
Ezekiel|28|14|Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, {so that} thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|15|Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.
Ezekiel|28|16|By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|17|Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|18|By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|19|All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.
Ezekiel|28|20|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|21|Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel|28|22|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
Ezekiel|28|23|For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|24|And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|25|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
Ezekiel|28|26|And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.
Ezekiel|29|1|In the tenth year, in the tenth {month}, in the twelfth {day} of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
