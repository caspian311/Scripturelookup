Nehemiah|12|8|Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, {and} Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
Nehemiah|12|9|Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, were over against them according to their offices.
Nehemiah|12|10|And Jeshua begat Joiakim, and Joiakim begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
Nehemiah|12|11|and Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
Nehemiah|12|12|And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’ {houses}: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
Nehemiah|12|13|of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
Nehemiah|12|14|of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
Nehemiah|12|15|of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
Nehemiah|12|16|of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
Nehemiah|12|17|of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
Nehemiah|12|18|of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
Nehemiah|12|19|and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
Nehemiah|12|20|of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
Nehemiah|12|21|of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
Nehemiah|12|22|As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers’ {houses}; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
Nehemiah|12|23|The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’ {houses}, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
Nehemiah|12|24|And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch next to watch.
Nehemiah|12|25|Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates.
Nehemiah|12|26|These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
Nehemiah|12|27|And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
Nehemiah|12|28|And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;
Nehemiah|12|29|also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|12|30|And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
Nehemiah|12|31|Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; {whereof one went} on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
Nehemiah|12|32|and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
Nehemiah|12|33|and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
Nehemiah|12|34|Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
Nehemiah|12|35|and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
Nehemiah|12|36|and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.
Nehemiah|12|37|And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
Nehemiah|12|38|And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,
Nehemiah|12|39|and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.
Nehemiah|12|40|So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;
Nehemiah|12|41|and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
Nehemiah|12|42|and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
Nehemiah|12|43|And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
Nehemiah|12|44|And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
Nehemiah|12|45|And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and {so did} the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
Nehemiah|12|46|For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
Nehemiah|12|47|And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart {that which was} for the Levites; and the Levites set apart {that which was} for the sons of Aaron.
Nehemiah|13|1|On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,
Nehemiah|13|2|because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah|13|3|And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
Nehemiah|13|4|Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,
Nehemiah|13|5|had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.
Nehemiah|13|6|But in all this {time} I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,
Nehemiah|13|7|and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah|13|8|And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah|13|9|Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah|13|10|And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
Nehemiah|13|11|Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
Nehemiah|13|12|Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah|13|13|And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.
Nehemiah|13|14|Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.
Nehemiah|13|15|In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses {therewith}; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified {against them} in the day wherein they sold victuals.
Nehemiah|13|16|There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|13|17|Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
Nehemiah|13|18|Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|19|And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
Nehemiah|13|20|So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah|13|21|Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|22|And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.
Nehemiah|13|23|In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, {and} of Moab:
Nehemiah|13|24|and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.
Nehemiah|13|25|And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, {saying}, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
Nehemiah|13|26|Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
Nehemiah|13|27|Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
Nehemiah|13|28|And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah|13|29|Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
Nehemiah|13|30|Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;
Nehemiah|13|31|and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
Ruth|1|1|And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
Ruth|1|2|And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
Ruth|1|3|And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
Ruth|1|4|And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
Ruth|1|5|And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
Ruth|1|6|Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.
Ruth|1|7|And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
Ruth|1|8|And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
Ruth|1|9|Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
Ruth|1|10|And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.
Ruth|1|11|And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth|1|12|Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;
Ruth|1|13|would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.
Ruth|1|14|And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.
Ruth|1|15|And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.
Ruth|1|16|And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
Ruth|1|17|where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.
Ruth|1|18|And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.
Ruth|1|19|So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and {the women} said, Is this Naomi?
Ruth|1|20|And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth|1|21|I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
Ruth|1|22|So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
Ruth|2|1|And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
Ruth|2|2|And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
Ruth|2|3|And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth|2|4|And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.
Ruth|2|5|Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
Ruth|2|6|And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
Ruth|2|7|And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.
