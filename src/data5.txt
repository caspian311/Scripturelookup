Joshua|11|7|So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
Joshua|11|8|And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
Joshua|11|9|And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
Joshua|11|10|And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua|11|11|And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
Joshua|11|12|And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.
Joshua|11|13|But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
Joshua|11|14|And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.
Joshua|11|15|As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.
Joshua|11|16|So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
Joshua|11|17|from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.
Joshua|11|18|Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua|11|19|There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.
Joshua|11|20|For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Joshua|11|21|And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
Joshua|11|22|There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
Joshua|11|23|So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua|12|1|Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:
Joshua|12|2|Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and {the city that is in} the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|12|3|and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
Joshua|12|4|and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Joshua|12|5|and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua|12|6|Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|12|7|And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
Joshua|12|8|in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Joshua|12|9|the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|10|the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua|12|11|the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua|12|12|the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua|12|13|the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua|12|14|the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua|12|15|the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua|12|16|the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|17|the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua|12|18|the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
Joshua|12|19|the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua|12|20|the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua|12|21|the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua|12|22|the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua|12|23|the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua|12|24|the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
Joshua|13|1|Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
Joshua|13|2|This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
Joshua|13|3|from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, {which} is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,
Joshua|13|4|on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;
Joshua|13|5|and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath;
Joshua|13|6|all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Joshua|13|7|Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|13|8|With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:
Joshua|13|9|from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
Joshua|13|10|and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|13|11|and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;
Joshua|13|12|all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out.
Joshua|13|13|Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.
Joshua|13|14|Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.
Joshua|13|15|And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua|13|16|And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Joshua|13|17|Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
Joshua|13|18|and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Joshua|13|19|and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
Joshua|13|20|and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
Joshua|13|21|and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.
Joshua|13|22|Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua|13|23|And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border {thereof}. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua|13|24|And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families.
Joshua|13|25|And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
Joshua|13|26|and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
Joshua|13|27|and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border {thereof}, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
Joshua|13|28|This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua|13|29|And Moses gave {inheritance} unto the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua|13|30|And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
Joshua|13|31|and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.
Joshua|13|32|These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
Joshua|13|33|But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Jehovah, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spake unto them.
Joshua|14|1|And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,
Joshua|14|2|by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
Joshua|14|3|For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
Joshua|14|4|For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
Joshua|14|5|As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.
Joshua|14|6|Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua|14|7|Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
Joshua|14|8|Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|9|And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|10|And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
Joshua|14|11|As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
Joshua|14|12|Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake.
Joshua|14|13|And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua|14|14|Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Joshua|14|15|Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; {which Arba was} the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua|15|1|And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
Joshua|15|2|And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;
Joshua|15|3|and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;
Joshua|15|4|and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border.
Joshua|15|5|And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;
Joshua|15|6|and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|15|7|and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel;
Joshua|15|8|and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward;
Joshua|15|9|and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim);
Joshua|15|10|and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;
Joshua|15|11|and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
Joshua|15|12|And the west border was to the great sea, and the border {thereof}. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
Joshua|15|13|And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, {which Arba was} the father of Anak (the same is Hebron).
Joshua|15|14|And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
Joshua|15|15|And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua|15|16|And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|17|And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|18|And it came to pass, when she came {unto him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?
Joshua|15|19|And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
Joshua|15|20|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
Joshua|15|21|And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
Joshua|15|22|and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
Joshua|15|23|and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
Joshua|15|24|Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,
Joshua|15|25|and Hazor-hadattah, and Kerioth-hezron (the same is Hazor),
Joshua|15|26|Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,
Joshua|15|27|and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-pelet,
Joshua|15|28|and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,
Joshua|15|29|Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
Joshua|15|30|and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
Joshua|15|31|and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
Joshua|15|32|and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages.
Joshua|15|33|In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
Joshua|15|34|and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
Joshua|15|35|Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
Joshua|15|36|and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|37|Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,
Joshua|15|38|and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
Joshua|15|39|Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
Joshua|15|40|and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
Joshua|15|41|and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|42|Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
Joshua|15|43|and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
Joshua|15|44|and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|45|Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
Joshua|15|46|from Ekron even unto the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
Joshua|15|47|Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border {thereof}.
Joshua|15|48|And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
Joshua|15|49|and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the same is Debir),
Joshua|15|50|and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
Joshua|15|51|and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|52|Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
Joshua|15|53|and Janim, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,
Joshua|15|54|and Humtah, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|55|Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
Joshua|15|56|and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
Joshua|15|57|Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|58|Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,
Joshua|15|59|and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|60|Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|61|In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
Joshua|15|62|and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|63|And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
Joshua|16|1|And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;
Joshua|16|2|and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;
Joshua|16|3|and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.
Joshua|16|4|And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
Joshua|16|5|And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was {thus}: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;
Joshua|16|6|and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
Joshua|16|7|and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
Joshua|16|8|From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;
Joshua|16|9|together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
Joshua|16|10|And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and are become servants to do taskwork.
Joshua|17|1|And {this} was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua|17|2|So {the lot} was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua|17|3|But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua|17|4|And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
Joshua|17|5|And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
Joshua|17|6|because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua|17|7|And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua|17|8|The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
Joshua|17|9|And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:
Joshua|17|10|southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
Joshua|17|11|And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
Joshua|17|12|Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out {the inhabitants of} those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Joshua|17|13|And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.
Joshua|17|14|And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?
Joshua|17|15|And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
Joshua|17|16|And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
Joshua|17|17|And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:
Joshua|17|18|but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
Joshua|18|1|And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua|18|2|And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.
Joshua|18|3|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?
Joshua|18|4|Appoint for you three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.
Joshua|18|5|And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.
Joshua|18|6|And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring {the description} hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.
Joshua|18|7|For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.
Joshua|18|8|And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.
Joshua|18|9|And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua|18|10|And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
Joshua|18|11|And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua|18|12|And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua|18|13|And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether.
Joshua|18|14|And the border extended {thence}, and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
Joshua|18|15|And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;
Joshua|18|16|and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;
Joshua|18|17|and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|18|18|and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;
Joshua|18|19|and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border.
Joshua|18|20|And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
Joshua|18|21|Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,
Joshua|18|22|and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,
Joshua|18|23|and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
Joshua|18|24|and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:
Joshua|18|25|Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
Joshua|18|26|and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
Joshua|18|27|and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
Joshua|18|28|and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, {and} Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
Joshua|19|1|And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah.
Joshua|19|2|And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
Joshua|19|3|and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
Joshua|19|4|and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
Joshua|19|5|and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
Joshua|19|6|and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:
Joshua|19|7|Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:
Joshua|19|8|and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
Joshua|19|9|Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
Joshua|19|10|And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;
Joshua|19|11|and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
Joshua|19|12|and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;
Joshua|19|13|and from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretcheth unto Neah;
Joshua|19|14|and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtah-el;
Joshua|19|15|and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|16|This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|17|The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families.
Joshua|19|18|And their border was unto Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
Joshua|19|19|and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
Joshua|19|20|and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,
Joshua|19|21|and Remeth, and Engannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez,
Joshua|19|22|and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|23|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|24|And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
Joshua|19|25|And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
Joshua|19|26|and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
Joshua|19|27|and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
Joshua|19|28|and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Sidon;
Joshua|19|29|and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
Joshua|19|30|Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|31|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|32|The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
Joshua|19|33|And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;
Joshua|19|34|and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|19|35|And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
Joshua|19|36|and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
Joshua|19|37|and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,
Joshua|19|38|And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|39|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|40|The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
Joshua|19|41|And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,
Joshua|19|42|and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,
Joshua|19|43|and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron,
Joshua|19|44|and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
Joshua|19|45|and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,
Joshua|19|46|and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
Joshua|19|47|And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua|19|48|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|49|So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
Joshua|19|50|according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
Joshua|19|51|These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
Joshua|20|1|And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|20|2|Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,
Joshua|20|3|that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly {and} unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua|20|4|And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
Joshua|20|5|And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
Joshua|20|6|And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
Joshua|20|7|And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah.
Joshua|20|8|And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|20|9|These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
Joshua|21|1|Then came near the heads of fathers’ {houses} of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua|21|2|and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
Joshua|21|3|And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|4|And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
Joshua|21|5|And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
Joshua|21|6|And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
Joshua|21|7|The children of Merari according to their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
Joshua|21|8|And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded by Moses.
Joshua|21|9|And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are {here} mentioned by name:
Joshua|21|10|and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
Joshua|21|11|And they gave them Kiriath-arba, {which Arba was} the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
Joshua|21|12|But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
Joshua|21|13|And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|14|and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|15|and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|16|and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, {and} Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
Joshua|21|17|And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|18|Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|19|All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|20|And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
Joshua|21|21|And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|22|and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|23|And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|24|Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|25|And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
Joshua|21|26|All the cities of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|27|And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh {they gave} Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
Joshua|21|28|And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|29|Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|30|And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|31|Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|32|And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
Joshua|21|33|All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|34|And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|35|Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|36|And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|37|Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|38|And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|39|Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
Joshua|21|40|All {these were} the cities of the children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.
Joshua|21|41|All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|42|These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus it was with all these cities.
Joshua|21|43|So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
Joshua|21|44|And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
Joshua|21|45|There failed not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
Joshua|22|1|Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua|22|2|and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:
Joshua|22|3|ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.
Joshua|22|4|And now Jehovah your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.
Joshua|22|5|Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Joshua|22|6|So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went unto their tents.
Joshua|22|7|Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given {inheritance} in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,
Joshua|22|8|and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
Joshua|22|9|And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
Joshua|22|10|And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.
Joshua|22|11|And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.
Joshua|22|12|And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.
Joshua|22|13|And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
Joshua|22|14|and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.
Joshua|22|15|And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
Joshua|22|16|Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?
Joshua|22|17|Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,
Joshua|22|18|that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
Joshua|22|19|Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
Joshua|22|20|Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
Joshua|22|21|Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
Joshua|22|22|The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day,)
Joshua|22|23|that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;
Joshua|22|24|and if we have not {rather} out of carefulness done this, {and} of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?
Joshua|22|25|for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.
Joshua|22|26|Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
Joshua|22|27|but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.
Joshua|22|28|Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.
Joshua|22|29|Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn away this day from following Jehovah, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
Joshua|22|30|And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well.
Joshua|22|31|And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
Joshua|22|32|And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
Joshua|22|33|And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
Joshua|22|34|And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar {Ed}: For, {said they}, it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.
Joshua|23|1|And it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;
Joshua|23|2|that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:
Joshua|23|3|and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your God, he it is that hath fought for you.
Joshua|23|4|Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
Joshua|23|5|And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you.
Joshua|23|6|Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
Joshua|23|7|that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear {by them}, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them;
Joshua|23|8|but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.
Joshua|23|9|For Jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.
Joshua|23|10|One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you.
Joshua|23|11|Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.
Joshua|23|12|Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;
Joshua|23|13|know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.
Joshua|23|14|And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.
Joshua|23|15|And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.
Joshua|23|16|When ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
Joshua|24|1|And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua|24|2|And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
Joshua|24|3|And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
Joshua|24|4|And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
Joshua|24|5|And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.
Joshua|24|6|And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.
Joshua|24|7|And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
Joshua|24|8|And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
Joshua|24|9|Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
Joshua|24|10|but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua|24|11|And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
Joshua|24|12|And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
Joshua|24|13|And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
Joshua|24|14|Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.
Joshua|24|15|And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
Joshua|24|16|And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;
Joshua|24|17|for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;
Joshua|24|18|and Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve Jehovah; for he is our God.
Joshua|24|19|And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.
Joshua|24|20|If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
Joshua|24|21|And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah.
Joshua|24|22|And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
Joshua|24|23|Now therefore put away, {said he}, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Joshua|24|24|And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.
Joshua|24|25|So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
Joshua|24|26|And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
Joshua|24|27|And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
Joshua|24|28|So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.
Joshua|24|29|And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
Joshua|24|30|And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Joshua|24|31|And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of Jehovah, that he had wrought for Israel.
Joshua|24|32|And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
Joshua|24|33|And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.
Nahum|1|1|The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum|1|2|Jehovah is a jealous God and avengeth; Jehovah avengeth and is full of wrath; Jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth {wrath} for his enemies.
Nahum|1|3|Jehovah is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear {the guilty}: Jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
Nahum|1|4|He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
Nahum|1|5|The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
Nahum|1|6|Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.
Nahum|1|7|Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.
Nahum|1|8|But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
Nahum|1|9|What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum|1|10|For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
Nahum|1|11|There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.
Nahum|1|12|Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
Nahum|1|13|And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
Nahum|1|14|And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
Nahum|1|15|Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
Nahum|2|1|He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
Nahum|2|2|For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.
Nahum|2|3|The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress {spears} are brandished.
Nahum|2|4|The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.
Nahum|2|5|He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.
Nahum|2|6|The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
Nahum|2|7|And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.
Nahum|2|8|But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, {they cry}; but none looketh back.
Nahum|2|9|Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
Nahum|2|10|She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
Nahum|2|11|Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion {and} the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?
Nahum|2|12|The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.
Nahum|2|13|Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
Nahum|3|1|Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.
Nahum|3|2|The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
Nahum|3|3|the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon their bodies;-
Nahum|3|4|because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
Nahum|3|5|Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
Nahum|3|6|And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.
Nahum|3|7|And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
Nahum|3|8|Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, {and} her wall was of the sea?
Nahum|3|9|Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
Nahum|3|10|Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
Nahum|3|11|Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
Nahum|3|12|All thy fortresses shall be {like} fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
Nahum|3|13|Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.
Nahum|3|14|Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.
Nahum|3|15|There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm: make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.
Nahum|3|16|Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.
Nahum|3|17|Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
Nahum|3|18|Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.
Nahum|3|19|There is no assuaging of thy hurt: thy wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap their hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
1 Kings|1|1|Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1 Kings|1|2|Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1 Kings|1|3|So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1 Kings|1|4|And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
1 Kings|1|5|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1 Kings|1|6|And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.
1 Kings|1|7|And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1 Kings|1|8|But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|9|And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:
1 Kings|1|10|but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1 Kings|1|11|Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1 Kings|1|12|Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1 Kings|1|13|Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
1 Kings|1|14|Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1 Kings|1|15|And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.
1 Kings|1|16|And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1 Kings|1|17|And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, {saying}, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1 Kings|1|18|And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:
1 Kings|1|19|and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|20|And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1 Kings|1|21|Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1 Kings|1|22|And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
1 Kings|1|23|And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1 Kings|1|24|And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1 Kings|1|25|For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, {Long} live king Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|26|But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|27|Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1 Kings|1|28|Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
1 Kings|1|29|And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
1 Kings|1|30|verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.
1 Kings|1|31|Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1 Kings|1|32|And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1 Kings|1|33|And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1 Kings|1|34|and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, {Long} live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|35|Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
1 Kings|1|36|And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so {too}.
1 Kings|1|37|As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
1 Kings|1|38|So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings|1|39|And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, {Long} live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|40|And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1 Kings|1|41|And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1 Kings|1|42|While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.
1 Kings|1|43|And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:
1 Kings|1|44|and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;
1 Kings|1|45|and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1 Kings|1|46|And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings|1|47|And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1 Kings|1|48|And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
1 Kings|1|49|And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1 Kings|1|50|And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|1|51|And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1 Kings|1|52|And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
1 Kings|1|53|So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.
1 Kings|2|1|Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
1 Kings|2|2|I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
1 Kings|2|3|and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, {and} his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
1 Kings|2|4|That Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
1 Kings|2|5|Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1 Kings|2|6|Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
1 Kings|2|7|But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.
1 Kings|2|8|And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
1 Kings|2|9|Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
1 Kings|2|10|And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings|2|11|And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1 Kings|2|12|And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1 Kings|2|13|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
1 Kings|2|14|He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
1 Kings|2|15|And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|16|And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
1 Kings|2|17|And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
1 Kings|2|18|And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1 Kings|2|19|Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
1 Kings|2|20|Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.
1 Kings|2|21|And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
1 Kings|2|22|And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
1 Kings|2|23|Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
1 Kings|2|24|Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
1 Kings|2|25|And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.
1 Kings|2|26|And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
1 Kings|2|27|So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
1 Kings|2|28|And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|2|29|And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
1 Kings|2|30|And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
1 Kings|2|31|And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.
1 Kings|2|32|And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, {to wit}, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
1 Kings|2|33|So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|34|Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings|2|35|And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
1 Kings|2|36|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
1 Kings|2|37|For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|38|And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1 Kings|2|39|And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
1 Kings|2|40|And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
1 Kings|2|41|And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
1 Kings|2|42|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good.
1 Kings|2|43|Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
1 Kings|2|44|The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|45|But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.
1 Kings|2|46|So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1 Kings|3|1|And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
1 Kings|3|2|Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.
1 Kings|3|3|And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1 Kings|3|4|And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1 Kings|3|5|In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
1 Kings|3|6|And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1 Kings|3|7|And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.
1 Kings|3|8|And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1 Kings|3|9|Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?
1 Kings|3|10|And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1 Kings|3|11|And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;
1 Kings|3|12|behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
1 Kings|3|13|And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.
1 Kings|3|14|And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1 Kings|3|15|And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
1 Kings|3|16|Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
1 Kings|3|17|And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1 Kings|3|18|And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
1 Kings|3|19|And this woman’s child died in the night, because she lay upon it.
1 Kings|3|20|And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1 Kings|3|21|And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.
1 Kings|3|22|And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
1 Kings|3|23|Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
1 Kings|3|24|And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1 Kings|3|25|And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1 Kings|3|26|Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.
1 Kings|3|27|Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
1 Kings|3|28|And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
1 Kings|4|1|And king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings|4|2|And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
1 Kings|4|3|Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
1 Kings|4|4|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
1 Kings|4|5|and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, {and} the king’s friend;
1 Kings|4|6|and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork.
1 Kings|4|7|And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.
1 Kings|4|8|And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
1 Kings|4|9|Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
1 Kings|4|10|Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him {pertained} Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);
1 Kings|4|11|Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|12|Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
1 Kings|4|13|Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him {pertained} the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; {even} to him {pertained} the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);
1 Kings|4|14|Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1 Kings|4|15|Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|16|Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
1 Kings|4|17|Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1 Kings|4|18|Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
1 Kings|4|19|Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and {he was} the only officer that was in the land.
1 Kings|4|20|Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
1 Kings|4|21|And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1 Kings|4|22|And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
1 Kings|4|23|ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.
1 Kings|4|24|For he had dominion over all {the region} on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
1 Kings|4|25|And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|4|26|And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
1 Kings|4|27|And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
1 Kings|4|28|Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where {the officers} were, every man according to his charge.
1 Kings|4|29|And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
1 Kings|4|30|And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1 Kings|4|31|For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about.
1 Kings|4|32|And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.
1 Kings|4|33|And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
1 Kings|4|34|And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
1 Kings|5|1|And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
1 Kings|5|2|And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1 Kings|5|3|Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.
1 Kings|5|4|But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
1 Kings|5|5|And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name.
1 Kings|5|6|Now therefore command thou that they cut me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that knoweth how to cut timber like unto the Sidonians.
1 Kings|5|7|And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
1 Kings|5|8|And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard {the message} which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
1 Kings|5|9|My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1 Kings|5|10|So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.
1 Kings|5|11|And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
1 Kings|5|12|And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
1 Kings|5|13|And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings|5|14|And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.
1 Kings|5|15|And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;
1 Kings|5|16|besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1 Kings|5|17|And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone.
1 Kings|5|18|And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
1 Kings|6|1|And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|6|2|And the house which king Solomon built for Jehovah, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty {cubits}, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
1 Kings|6|3|And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; {and} ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
1 Kings|6|4|And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.
1 Kings|6|5|And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.
1 Kings|6|6|The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets {in the wall} of the house round about, that {the beams} should not have hold in the walls of the house.
1 Kings|6|7|And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
1 Kings|6|8|The door for the middle side-chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle {story}, and out of the middle into the third.
1 Kings|6|9|So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
1 Kings|6|10|And he built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
1 Kings|6|11|And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,
1 Kings|6|12|Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.
1 Kings|6|13|And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
1 Kings|6|14|So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1 Kings|6|15|And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.
1 Kings|6|16|And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the walls {of the ceiling}: he built {them} for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.
1 Kings|6|17|And the house, that is, the temple before {the oracle}, was forty cubits {long}.
1 Kings|6|18|And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
1 Kings|6|19|And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
1 Kings|6|20|And within the oracle was {a space of} twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.
1 Kings|6|21|So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
1 Kings|6|22|And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle he overlaid with gold.
1 Kings|6|23|And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.
1 Kings|6|24|And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
1 Kings|6|25|And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
1 Kings|6|26|The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
1 Kings|6|27|And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
1 Kings|6|28|And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings|6|29|And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.
1 Kings|6|30|And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1 Kings|6|31|And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood: the lintel {and} door-posts were a fifth part {of the wall}.
1 Kings|6|32|So {he made} two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.
1 Kings|6|33|So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, out of a fourth part {of the wall};
1 Kings|6|34|and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
1 Kings|6|35|And he carved {thereon} cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.
1 Kings|6|36|And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.
1 Kings|6|37|In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.
1 Kings|6|38|And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
1 Kings|7|1|And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1 Kings|7|2|For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1 Kings|7|3|And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.
1 Kings|7|4|And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.
1 Kings|7|5|And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.
1 Kings|7|6|And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.
1 Kings|7|7|And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
1 Kings|7|8|And his house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken to wife), like unto this porch.
1 Kings|7|9|All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.
1 Kings|7|10|And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
1 Kings|7|11|And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.
1 Kings|7|12|And the great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.
1 Kings|7|13|And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings|7|14|He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
1 Kings|7|15|For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.
1 Kings|7|16|And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
1 Kings|7|17|There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
1 Kings|7|18|So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.
1 Kings|7|19|And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.
1 Kings|7|20|And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.
1 Kings|7|21|And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
1 Kings|7|22|And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
1 Kings|7|23|And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
1 Kings|7|24|And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
1 Kings|7|25|It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1 Kings|7|26|And it was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.
1 Kings|7|27|And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
1 Kings|7|28|And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;
1 Kings|7|29|and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
1 Kings|7|30|And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
1 Kings|7|31|And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.
1 Kings|7|32|And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
1 Kings|7|33|And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.
1 Kings|7|34|And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.
1 Kings|7|35|And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.
1 Kings|7|36|And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.
1 Kings|7|37|After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.
1 Kings|7|38|And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver.
1 Kings|7|39|And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
1 Kings|7|40|And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:
1 Kings|7|41|the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
1 Kings|7|42|and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;
1 Kings|7|43|and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;
1 Kings|7|44|and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
1 Kings|7|45|and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.
1 Kings|7|46|In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
1 Kings|7|47|And Solomon left all the vessels {unweighed}, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.
1 Kings|7|48|And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;
1 Kings|7|49|and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
1 Kings|7|50|and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, {to wit}, of the temple, of gold.
1 Kings|7|51|Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, {even} the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|1|Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ {houses} of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
1 Kings|8|2|And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
1 Kings|8|3|And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1 Kings|8|4|And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
1 Kings|8|5|And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
1 Kings|8|6|And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings|8|7|For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
1 Kings|8|8|And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
1 Kings|8|9|There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings|8|10|And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
1 Kings|8|11|so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|12|Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
1 Kings|8|13|I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.
1 Kings|8|14|And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
1 Kings|8|15|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
1 Kings|8|16|Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
1 Kings|8|17|Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Kings|8|18|But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
1 Kings|8|19|nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
1 Kings|8|20|And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Kings|8|21|And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings|8|22|And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
1 Kings|8|23|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;
1 Kings|8|24|who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
1 Kings|8|25|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
1 Kings|8|26|Now therefore, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
1 Kings|8|27|But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!
1 Kings|8|28|Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;
1 Kings|8|29|that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
1 Kings|8|30|And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place; and when thou hearest, forgive.
1 Kings|8|31|If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he come {and} swear before thine altar in this house;
1 Kings|8|32|then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1 Kings|8|33|When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house:
1 Kings|8|34|then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
1 Kings|8|35|When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:
1 Kings|8|36|then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1 Kings|8|37|If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting {or} mildew, locust {or} caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
1 Kings|8|38|what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, {or} by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
1 Kings|8|39|then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
1 Kings|8|40|that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
1 Kings|8|41|Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name’s sake
1 Kings|8|42|(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;
1 Kings|8|43|hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
1 Kings|8|44|If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name;
1 Kings|8|45|then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1 Kings|8|46|If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;
1 Kings|8|47|yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
1 Kings|8|48|if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
1 Kings|8|49|then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;
1 Kings|8|50|and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
1 Kings|8|51|(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
1 Kings|8|52|that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee.
1 Kings|8|53|For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|54|And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.
1 Kings|8|55|And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1 Kings|8|56|Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.
1 Kings|8|57|Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;
1 Kings|8|58|that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
1 Kings|8|59|And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
1 Kings|8|60|that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.
1 Kings|8|61|Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
1 Kings|8|62|And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|63|And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|64|The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
1 Kings|8|65|So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
1 Kings|8|66|On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David his servant, and to Israel his people.
1 Kings|9|1|And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,
1 Kings|9|2|that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
1 Kings|9|3|And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
1 Kings|9|4|And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
1 Kings|9|5|then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
1 Kings|9|6|But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
1 Kings|9|7|then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
1 Kings|9|8|And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?
1 Kings|9|9|and they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath Jehovah brought all this evil upon them.
1 Kings|9|10|And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king’s house
1 Kings|9|11|(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1 Kings|9|12|And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
1 Kings|9|13|And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
1 Kings|9|14|And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
1 Kings|9|15|And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
1 Kings|9|16|Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
1 Kings|9|17|And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
1 Kings|9|18|and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
1 Kings|9|19|and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
1 Kings|9|20|As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;
1 Kings|9|21|their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.
1 Kings|9|22|But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
1 Kings|9|23|These were the chief officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1 Kings|9|24|But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which {Solomon} had built for her: then did he build Millo.
1 Kings|9|25|And three times a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto Jehovah, burning incense therewith, {upon the altar} that was before Jehovah. So he finished the house.
1 Kings|9|26|And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1 Kings|9|27|And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
1 Kings|9|28|And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
1 Kings|10|1|And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.
1 Kings|10|2|And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1 Kings|10|3|And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.
1 Kings|10|4|And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
1 Kings|10|5|and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
1 Kings|10|6|And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|7|Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
1 Kings|10|8|Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, {and} that hear thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|9|Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.
1 Kings|10|10|And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1 Kings|10|11|And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.
1 Kings|10|12|And the king made of the almug-trees pillars for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor were seen, unto this day.
1 Kings|10|13|And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
1 Kings|10|14|Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
1 Kings|10|15|besides {that which} the traders {brought}, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.
1 Kings|10|16|And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred {shekels} of gold went to one buckler.
1 Kings|10|17|And {he made} three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1 Kings|10|18|Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
1 Kings|10|19|There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
1 Kings|10|20|And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1 Kings|10|21|And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|10|22|For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1 Kings|10|23|So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
1 Kings|10|24|And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1 Kings|10|25|And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1 Kings|10|26|And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1 Kings|10|27|And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
1 Kings|10|28|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
1 Kings|10|29|And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
1 Kings|11|1|Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
1 Kings|11|2|of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
1 Kings|11|3|And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
1 Kings|11|4|For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.
1 Kings|11|5|For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
1 Kings|11|6|And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|7|Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
1 Kings|11|8|And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1 Kings|11|9|And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,
1 Kings|11|10|and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.
1 Kings|11|11|Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
1 Kings|11|12|Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1 Kings|11|13|Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.
1 Kings|11|14|And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
1 Kings|11|15|For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom
1 Kings|11|16|(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
1 Kings|11|17|that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
1 Kings|11|18|And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
1 Kings|11|19|And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
1 Kings|11|20|And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
1 Kings|11|21|And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
1 Kings|11|22|Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.
1 Kings|11|23|And God raised up {another} adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
1 Kings|11|24|And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them {of Zobah}: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
1 Kings|11|25|And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad {did}: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
1 Kings|11|26|And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.
1 Kings|11|27|And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.
1 Kings|11|28|And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
1 Kings|11|29|And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now {Ahijah} had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
1 Kings|11|30|And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.
1 Kings|11|31|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee
1 Kings|11|32|(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);
1 Kings|11|33|because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and {to keep} my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|34|Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
1 Kings|11|35|but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
1 Kings|11|36|And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
1 Kings|11|37|And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
1 Kings|11|38|And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
1 Kings|11|39|And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1 Kings|11|40|Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1 Kings|11|41|Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1 Kings|11|42|And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings|11|43|And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|12|1|And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings|12|2|And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,
1 Kings|12|3|and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
1 Kings|12|4|Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1 Kings|12|5|And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
1 Kings|12|6|And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
1 Kings|12|7|And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
1 Kings|12|8|But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.
1 Kings|12|9|And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?
1 Kings|12|10|And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
1 Kings|12|11|And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings|12|12|So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1 Kings|12|13|And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
1 Kings|12|14|and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings|12|15|So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was a thing brought about of Jehovah, that he might establish his word, which Jehovah spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings|12|16|And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
1 Kings|12|17|But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1 Kings|12|18|Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings|12|19|So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1 Kings|12|20|And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1 Kings|12|21|And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1 Kings|12|22|But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1 Kings|12|23|Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
1 Kings|12|24|Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the word of Jehovah, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|12|25|Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.
1 Kings|12|26|And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:
1 Kings|12|27|if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
1 Kings|12|28|Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings|12|29|And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.
1 Kings|12|30|And this thing became a sin; for the people went {to worship} before the one, even unto Dan.
1 Kings|12|31|And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi.
1 Kings|12|32|And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made.
1 Kings|12|33|And he went up unto the altar which he had made in Beth-el on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto the altar, to burn incense.
1 Kings|13|1|And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings|13|2|And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.
1 Kings|13|3|And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
1 Kings|13|4|And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.
1 Kings|13|5|The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|13|6|And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
1 Kings|13|7|And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
1 Kings|13|8|And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
1 Kings|13|9|for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.
1 Kings|13|10|So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
1 Kings|13|11|Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.
1 Kings|13|12|And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.
1 Kings|13|13|And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.
1 Kings|13|14|And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
1 Kings|13|15|Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1 Kings|13|16|And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
1 Kings|13|17|for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
1 Kings|13|18|And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. {But} he lied unto him.
1 Kings|13|19|So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
1 Kings|13|20|And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;
1 Kings|13|21|and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
1 Kings|13|22|but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
1 Kings|13|23|And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, {to wit}, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
1 Kings|13|24|And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.
1 Kings|13|25|And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1 Kings|13|26|And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him.
1 Kings|13|27|And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.
1 Kings|13|28|And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.
1 Kings|13|29|And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
1 Kings|13|30|And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, {saying}, Alas, my brother!
1 Kings|13|31|And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
1 Kings|13|32|For the saying which he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
1 Kings|13|33|After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
1 Kings|13|34|And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
1 Kings|14|1|At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1 Kings|14|2|And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people.
1 Kings|14|3|And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.
1 Kings|14|4|And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
1 Kings|14|5|And Jehovah said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire of thee concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her; for it will be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
1 Kings|14|6|And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1 Kings|14|7|Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
1 Kings|14|8|and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,
1 Kings|14|9|but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
1 Kings|14|10|therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone.
1 Kings|14|11|Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it.
1 Kings|14|12|Arise thou therefore, get thee to thy house: {and} when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
1 Kings|14|13|And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
1 Kings|14|14|Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
1 Kings|14|15|For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.
1 Kings|14|16|And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he hath sinned, and wherewith he hath made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|14|17|And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: {and} as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
1 Kings|14|18|And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings|14|19|And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1 Kings|14|20|And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|14|21|And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
1 Kings|14|22|And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.
1 Kings|14|23|For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;
1 Kings|14|24|and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah drove out before the children of Israel.
1 Kings|14|25|And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
1 Kings|14|26|and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
1 Kings|14|27|And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.
1 Kings|14|28|And it was so, that, as oft as the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
1 Kings|14|29|Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings|14|30|And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings|14|31|And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|1|Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.
1 Kings|15|2|Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings|15|3|And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.
1 Kings|15|4|Nevertheless for David’s sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;
1 Kings|15|5|because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
1 Kings|15|6|Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1 Kings|15|7|And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1 Kings|15|8|And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|9|And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.
1 Kings|15|10|And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings|15|11|And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father.
1 Kings|15|12|And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
1 Kings|15|13|And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
1 Kings|15|14|But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
1 Kings|15|15|And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things that his father had dedicated, and the things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
1 Kings|15|16|And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings|15|17|And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1 Kings|15|18|Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
1 Kings|15|19|{There is} a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1 Kings|15|20|And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
1 Kings|15|21|And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
1 Kings|15|22|Then king Asa made a proclamation unto all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
1 Kings|15|23|Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1 Kings|15|24|And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|25|And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
1 Kings|15|26|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|15|27|And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1 Kings|15|28|Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|29|And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
1 Kings|15|30|for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation wherewith he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger.
1 Kings|15|31|Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|15|32|And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings|15|33|In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, {and reigned} twenty and four years.
1 Kings|15|34|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|16|1|And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
1 Kings|16|2|Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1 Kings|16|3|behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings|16|4|Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
1 Kings|16|5|Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|6|And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|7|And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.
1 Kings|16|8|In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, {and reigned} two years.
1 Kings|16|9|And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
1 Kings|16|10|and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|11|And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
1 Kings|16|12|Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
1 Kings|16|13|for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|14|Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|15|In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1 Kings|16|16|And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1 Kings|16|17|And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|18|And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
1 Kings|16|19|for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
1 Kings|16|20|Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|21|Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1 Kings|16|22|But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1 Kings|16|23|In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, {and reigned} twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|24|And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
1 Kings|16|25|And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|26|For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|27|Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|28|So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|29|And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
1 Kings|16|30|And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|31|And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
1 Kings|16|32|And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1 Kings|16|33|And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
1 Kings|16|34|In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
1 Kings|17|1|And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
1 Kings|17|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|3|Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|4|And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1 Kings|17|5|So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|6|And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
1 Kings|17|7|And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1 Kings|17|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|9|Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.
1 Kings|17|10|So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1 Kings|17|11|And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
1 Kings|17|12|And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
1 Kings|17|13|And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
1 Kings|17|14|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|17|15|And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days.
1 Kings|17|16|The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah.
1 Kings|17|17|And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
1 Kings|17|18|And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!
1 Kings|17|19|And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
1 Kings|17|20|And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
1 Kings|17|21|And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.
1 Kings|17|22|And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
1 Kings|17|23|And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
1 Kings|17|24|And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.
1 Kings|18|1|And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|18|2|And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.
1 Kings|18|3|And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:
1 Kings|18|4|for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
1 Kings|18|5|And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
1 Kings|18|6|So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1 Kings|18|7|And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?
1 Kings|18|8|And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
1 Kings|18|9|And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
1 Kings|18|10|As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
1 Kings|18|11|And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
1 Kings|18|12|And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.
1 Kings|18|13|Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
1 Kings|18|14|And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}; and he will slay me.
1 Kings|18|15|And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.
1 Kings|18|16|So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings|18|17|And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?
1 Kings|18|18|And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.
1 Kings|18|19|Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel’s table.
1 Kings|18|20|So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
1 Kings|18|21|And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
1 Kings|18|22|Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
1 Kings|18|23|Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|24|And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
1 Kings|18|25|And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|26|And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.
1 Kings|18|27|And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.
1 Kings|18|28|And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.
1 Kings|18|29|And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the {evening} oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
1 Kings|18|30|And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.
1 Kings|18|31|And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
1 Kings|18|32|And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
1 Kings|18|33|And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.
1 Kings|18|34|And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
1 Kings|18|35|And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1 Kings|18|36|And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the {evening} oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
1 Kings|18|37|Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and {that} thou hast turned their heart back again.
1 Kings|18|38|Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
1 Kings|18|39|And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God.
1 Kings|18|40|and Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1 Kings|18|41|And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
1 Kings|18|42|So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
1 Kings|18|43|And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
1 Kings|18|44|And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a cloud out of the sea, as small as a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Make ready {thy chariot}, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
1 Kings|18|45|And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:
1 Kings|18|46|and the hand of Jehovah was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
1 Kings|19|1|And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
1 Kings|19|2|Then Jezebel send a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.
1 Kings|19|3|And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
1 Kings|19|4|But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
1 Kings|19|5|And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
1 Kings|19|6|And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
1 Kings|19|7|And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.
1 Kings|19|8|And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
1 Kings|19|9|And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1 Kings|19|10|And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
1 Kings|19|11|And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake:
1 Kings|19|12|and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
1 Kings|19|13|And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1 Kings|19|14|And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
1 Kings|19|15|And Jehovah said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;
1 Kings|19|16|and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
1 Kings|19|17|And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
1 Kings|19|18|Yet will I leave {me} seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
1 Kings|19|19|So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke {of oxen} before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him.
1 Kings|19|20|And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?
1 Kings|19|21|And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.
1 Kings|20|1|And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
1 Kings|20|2|And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
1 Kings|20|3|Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
1 Kings|20|4|And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have.
1 Kings|20|5|And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
1 Kings|20|6|but I will send my servants unto thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
1 Kings|20|7|Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
1 Kings|20|8|And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent.
1 Kings|20|9|Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
1 Kings|20|10|And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
1 Kings|20|11|And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on {his armor} boast himself as he that putteth it off.
1 Kings|20|12|And it came to pass, when {Ben-hadad} heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set {yourselves in array}. And they set {themselves in array} against the city.
1 Kings|20|13|And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
1 Kings|20|14|And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.
1 Kings|20|15|Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
1 Kings|20|16|And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
1 Kings|20|17|And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.
1 Kings|20|18|And he said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.
1 Kings|20|19|So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
1 Kings|20|20|And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
1 Kings|20|21|And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1 Kings|20|22|And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1 Kings|20|23|And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1 Kings|20|24|And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;
1 Kings|20|25|and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
1 Kings|20|26|And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
1 Kings|20|27|And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
1 Kings|20|28|And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
1 Kings|20|29|And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
1 Kings|20|30|But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
1 Kings|20|31|And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
1 Kings|20|32|So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and {put} ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
1 Kings|20|33|Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
1 Kings|20|34|And {Ben-hadad} said unto him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I, {said Ahab}, will let thee go with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
1 Kings|20|35|And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
1 Kings|20|36|Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
1 Kings|20|37|Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.
1 Kings|20|38|So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
1 Kings|20|39|And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
1 Kings|20|40|And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
1 Kings|20|41|And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
1 Kings|20|42|And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
1 Kings|20|43|And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
1 Kings|21|1|And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1 Kings|21|2|And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
1 Kings|21|3|And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
1 Kings|21|4|And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
1 Kings|21|5|But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
1 Kings|21|6|And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee {another} vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
1 Kings|21|7|And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1 Kings|21|8|So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, {and} that dwelt with Naboth.
1 Kings|21|9|And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
1 Kings|21|10|and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst curse God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him to death.
1 Kings|21|11|And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
1 Kings|21|12|They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1 Kings|21|13|And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.
1 Kings|21|14|Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
1 Kings|21|15|And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
1 Kings|21|16|And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1 Kings|21|17|And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings|21|18|Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
1 Kings|21|19|And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
1 Kings|21|20|And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.
1 Kings|21|21|Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:
1 Kings|21|22|and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|21|23|And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
1 Kings|21|24|Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
1 Kings|21|25|(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
1 Kings|21|26|And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)
1 Kings|21|27|And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1 Kings|21|28|And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings|21|29|Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.
1 Kings|22|1|And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings|22|2|And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|3|And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1 Kings|22|4|And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
1 Kings|22|5|And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|22|6|Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|7|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
1 Kings|22|8|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
1 Kings|22|9|Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
1 Kings|22|10|Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
1 Kings|22|11|And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
1 Kings|22|12|And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|13|And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets {declare} good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.
1 Kings|22|14|And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.
1 Kings|22|15|And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|16|And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
1 Kings|22|17|And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
1 Kings|22|18|And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
1 Kings|22|19|And {Micaiah} said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
1 Kings|22|20|And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.
1 Kings|22|21|And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
1 Kings|22|22|And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
1 Kings|22|23|Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.
1 Kings|22|24|Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?
1 Kings|22|25|And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1 Kings|22|26|And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
1 Kings|22|27|and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
1 Kings|22|28|And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
1 Kings|22|29|So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1 Kings|22|30|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1 Kings|22|31|Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|32|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
1 Kings|22|33|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1 Kings|22|34|And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
1 Kings|22|35|And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
1 Kings|22|36|And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.
1 Kings|22|37|So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings|22|38|And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves {there}); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.
1 Kings|22|39|Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|22|40|So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|22|41|And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|42|Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1 Kings|22|43|And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1 Kings|22|44|And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|45|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings|22|46|And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.
1 Kings|22|47|And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1 Kings|22|48|Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
1 Kings|22|49|Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1 Kings|22|50|And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|22|51|Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
1 Kings|22|52|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|22|53|And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
Hebrews|1|1|God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,
Hebrews|1|2|hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in {his} Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;
Hebrews|1|3|who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
Hebrews|1|4|having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
Hebrews|1|5|For unto which of the angels said he at any time,             Thou art my Son,                   This day have I begotten thee?            and again,             I will be to him a Father,                   And he shall be to me a Son?
Hebrews|1|6|And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
Hebrews|1|7|And of the angels he saith,             Who maketh his angels winds,                   And his ministers a flame a fire:
Hebrews|1|8|but of the Son {he saith,}             Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;                   And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Hebrews|1|9|Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;                   Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee                   With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Hebrews|1|10|And,             Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth,                   And the heavens are the works of thy hands:
Hebrews|1|11|They shall perish; but thou continuest:                   And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
Hebrews|1|12|And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up,                   As a garment, and they shall be changed:                   But thou art the same,                   And thy years shall not fail.
Hebrews|1|13|But of which of the angels hath he said at any time,             Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
Hebrews|1|14|Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?
Hebrews|2|1|Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away {from them}.
Hebrews|2|2|For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
Hebrews|2|3|how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;
Hebrews|2|4|God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.
Hebrews|2|5|For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.
Hebrews|2|6|But one hath somewhere testified, saying,             What is man, that thou art mindful of him?                   Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Hebrews|2|7|Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;                   Thou crownedst him with glory and honor,                   And didst set him over the works of thy hands:
Hebrews|2|8|Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet.            For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.
Hebrews|2|9|But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, {even} Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every {man}.
Hebrews|2|10|For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Hebrews|2|11|For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews|2|12|saying,             I will declare thy name unto my brethren,                   In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.
Hebrews|2|13|And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.
Hebrews|2|14|Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
Hebrews|2|15|and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews|2|16|For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews|2|17|Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews|2|18|For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.
Hebrews|3|1|Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, {even} Jesus;
Hebrews|3|2|who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
Hebrews|3|3|For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
Hebrews|3|4|For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
Hebrews|3|5|And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;
Hebrews|3|6|but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
Hebrews|3|7|Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith,             To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
Hebrews|3|8|Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,                   Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
Hebrews|3|9|Where your fathers tried {me} by proving {me,}                   And saw my works forty years.
Hebrews|3|10|Wherefore I was displeased with this generation,                   And said, They do always err in their heart:                   But they did not know my ways;
Hebrews|3|11|As I sware in my wrath,                   They shall not enter into my rest.
Hebrews|3|12|Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:
Hebrews|3|13|but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:
Hebrews|3|14|for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:
Hebrews|3|15|while it is said,             To-day if ye shall hear his voice,                   Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
Hebrews|3|16|For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?
Hebrews|3|17|And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews|3|18|And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?
Hebrews|3|19|And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews|4|1|Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.
Hebrews|4|2|For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.
Hebrews|4|3|For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said,             As I sware in my wrath,                   They shall not enter into my rest:            although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews|4|4|For he hath said somewhere of the seventh {day} on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;
Hebrews|4|5|and in this {place} again,             They shall not enter into my rest.
Hebrews|4|6|Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
Hebrews|4|7|he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before),             To-day if ye shall hear his voice,                   Harden not your hearts.
Hebrews|4|8|For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
Hebrews|4|9|There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews|4|10|For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
Hebrews|4|11|Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.
Hebrews|4|12|For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews|4|13|And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews|4|14|Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
Hebrews|4|15|For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as {we are, yet} without sin.
Hebrews|4|16|Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help {us} in time of need.
Hebrews|5|1|For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Hebrews|5|2|who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;
Hebrews|5|3|and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
Hebrews|5|4|And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.
Hebrews|5|5|So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him,             Thou art my Son,                   This day have I begotten thee:
Hebrews|5|6|as he saith also in another {place,}             Thou art a priest for ever                   After the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|5|7|Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
Hebrews|5|8|though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;
Hebrews|5|9|and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;
Hebrews|5|10|named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|5|11|Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.
Hebrews|5|12|For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.
Hebrews|5|13|For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.
Hebrews|5|14|But solid food is for fullgrown men, {even} those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.
Hebrews|6|1|Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Hebrews|6|2|of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
Hebrews|6|3|And this will we do, if God permit.
Hebrews|6|4|For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
Hebrews|6|5|and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews|6|6|and {then} fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
Hebrews|6|7|For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:
Hebrews|6|8|but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.
Hebrews|6|9|But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:
Hebrews|6|10|for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.
Hebrews|6|11|And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:
Hebrews|6|12|that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
Hebrews|6|13|For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,
Hebrews|6|14|saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
Hebrews|6|15|And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews|6|16|For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
Hebrews|6|17|Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
Hebrews|6|18|that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:
Hebrews|6|19|which we have as an anchor of the soul, {a hope} both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
Hebrews|6|20|whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|7|1|For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
Hebrews|7|2|to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;
Hebrews|7|3|without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.
Hebrews|7|4|Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.
Hebrews|7|5|And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:
Hebrews|7|6|but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.
Hebrews|7|7|But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.
Hebrews|7|8|And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
Hebrews|7|9|And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;
Hebrews|7|10|for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews|7|11|Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need {was there} that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews|7|12|For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
Hebrews|7|13|For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.
Hebrews|7|14|For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.
Hebrews|7|15|And {what we say} is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,
Hebrews|7|16|who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
Hebrews|7|17|for it is witnessed {of him,}             Thou art a priest for ever                   After the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|7|18|For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
Hebrews|7|19|(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.
Hebrews|7|20|And inasmuch as {it is} not without the taking of an oath
Hebrews|7|21|(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him,             The Lord sware and will not repent himself,                   Thou art a priest for ever);
Hebrews|7|22|by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
Hebrews|7|23|And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:
Hebrews|7|24|but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.
Hebrews|7|25|Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
Hebrews|7|26|For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
Hebrews|7|27|who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the {sins} of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
Hebrews|7|28|For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, {appointeth} a Son, perfected for evermore.
Hebrews|8|1|Now in the things which we are saying the chief point {is this}: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
Hebrews|8|2|a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
Hebrews|8|3|For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this {high priest} also have somewhat to offer.
Hebrews|8|4|Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
Hebrews|8|5|who serve {that which is} a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned {of God} when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.
Hebrews|8|6|But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.
Hebrews|8|7|For if that first {covenant} had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.
Hebrews|8|8|For finding fault with them, he saith,             Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,                   That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
Hebrews|8|9|Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers                   In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt;                   For they continued not in my covenant,                   And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
Hebrews|8|10|For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel                   After those days, saith the Lord;                   I will put my laws into their mind,                   And on their heart also will I write them:                   And I will be to them a God,                   And they shall be to me a people:
Hebrews|8|11|And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen,                   And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:                   For all shall know me,                   From the least to the greatest of them.
Hebrews|8|12|For I will be merciful to their iniquities,                   And their sins will I remember no more.
Hebrews|8|13|In that he saith, A new {covenant} he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.
Hebrews|9|1|Now even a first {covenant} had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, {a sanctuary} of this world.
Hebrews|9|2|For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein {were} the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.
Hebrews|9|3|And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;
Hebrews|9|4|having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein {was} a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews|9|5|and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.
Hebrews|9|6|Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;
Hebrews|9|7|but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:
Hebrews|9|8|the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;
Hebrews|9|9|which {is} a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,
Hebrews|9|10|{being} only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
Hebrews|9|11|But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
Hebrews|9|12|nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.
Hebrews|9|13|For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:
Hebrews|9|14|how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews|9|15|And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews|9|16|For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.
Hebrews|9|17|For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.
Hebrews|9|18|Wherefore even the first {covenant} hath not been dedicated without blood.
Hebrews|9|19|For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews|9|20|saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.
Hebrews|9|21|Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.
Hebrews|9|22|And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
Hebrews|9|23|It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews|9|24|For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:
Hebrews|9|25|nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;
Hebrews|9|26|else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews|9|27|And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this {cometh} judgment;
Hebrews|9|28|so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.
Hebrews|10|1|For the law having a shadow of the good {things} to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.
Hebrews|10|2|Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.
Hebrews|10|3|But in those {sacrifices} there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
Hebrews|10|4|For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
Hebrews|10|5|Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith,             Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,                   But a body didst thou prepare for me;
Hebrews|10|6|In whole burnt offerings and {sacrifices} for sin thou hadst no pleasure:
Hebrews|10|7|Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me)                   To do thy will, O God.
Hebrews|10|8|Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and {sacrifices} for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),
Hebrews|10|9|then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
Hebrews|10|10|By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews|10|11|And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:
Hebrews|10|12|but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
Hebrews|10|13|henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.
Hebrews|10|14|For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews|10|15|And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,
Hebrews|10|16|This is the covenant that I will make with them                   After those days, saith the Lord:                   I will put my laws on their heart,                   And upon their mind also will I write them;                   {then saith he,}
Hebrews|10|17|And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews|10|18|Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
Hebrews|10|19|Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews|10|20|by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
Hebrews|10|21|and {having} a great priest over the house of God;
Hebrews|10|22|let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,
Hebrews|10|23|let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:
Hebrews|10|24|and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;
Hebrews|10|25|not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting {one another}; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.
Hebrews|10|26|For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews|10|27|but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.
Hebrews|10|28|A man that hath set at nought Moses law dieth without compassion on {the word of} two or three witnesses:
Hebrews|10|29|of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews|10|30|For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
Hebrews|10|31|It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews|10|32|But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews|10|33|partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.
Hebrews|10|34|For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
Hebrews|10|35|Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.
Hebrews|10|36|For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.
Hebrews|10|37|For yet a very little while,                   He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.
Hebrews|10|38|But my righteous one shall live by faith:                   And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.
Hebrews|10|39|But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.
Hebrews|11|1|Now faith is assurance of {things} hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.
Hebrews|11|2|For therein the elders had witness borne to them.
Hebrews|11|3|By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.
Hebrews|11|4|By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.
Hebrews|11|5|By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:
Hebrews|11|6|And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing {unto him}; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and {that} he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.
Hebrews|11|7|By faith Noah, being warned {of God} concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
Hebrews|11|8|By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
Hebrews|11|9|By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a {land} not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
Hebrews|11|10|for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
Hebrews|11|11|By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:
Hebrews|11|12|wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, {so many} as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.
Hebrews|11|13|These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
Hebrews|11|14|For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.
Hebrews|11|15|And if indeed they had been mindful of that {country} from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
Hebrews|11|16|But now they desire a better {country}, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
Hebrews|11|17|By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten {son};
Hebrews|11|18|even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews|11|19|accounting that God {is} able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.
Hebrews|11|20|By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
Hebrews|11|21|By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, {leaning} upon the top of his staff.
Hebrews|11|22|By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
Hebrews|11|23|By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
Hebrews|11|24|By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
Hebrews|11|25|choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
Hebrews|11|26|accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.
Hebrews|11|27|By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
Hebrews|11|28|By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
Hebrews|11|29|By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.
Hebrews|11|30|By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.
Hebrews|11|31|By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
Hebrews|11|32|And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:
Hebrews|11|33|who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews|11|34|quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.
Hebrews|11|35|Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
Hebrews|11|36|and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
Hebrews|11|37|they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
Hebrews|11|38|(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.
Hebrews|11|39|And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,
Hebrews|11|40|God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
Hebrews|12|1|Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
Hebrews|12|2|looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of {our} faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews|12|3|For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.
Hebrews|12|4|Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:
Hebrews|12|5|and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons,             My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord,                   Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;
Hebrews|12|6|For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,                   And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
Hebrews|12|7|It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom {his} father chasteneth not?
Hebrews|12|8|But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Hebrews|12|9|Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
Hebrews|12|10|For they indeed for a few days chastened {us} as seemed good to them; but he for {our} profit, that {we} may be partakers of his holiness.
Hebrews|12|11|All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, {even the fruit} of righteousness.
Hebrews|12|12|Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;
Hebrews|12|13|and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
Hebrews|12|14|Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:
Hebrews|12|15|looking carefully lest {there be} any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble {you}, and thereby the many be defiled;
Hebrews|12|16|lest {there be} any fornication, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.
Hebrews|12|17|For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind {in his father,} though he sought it diligently with tears.
Hebrews|12|18|For ye are not come unto {a mount} that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
Hebrews|12|19|and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which {voice} they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;
Hebrews|12|20|for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
Hebrews|12|21|and so fearful was the appearance, {that} Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:
Hebrews|12|22|but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
Hebrews|12|23|to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
Hebrews|12|24|and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than {that of} Abel.
Hebrews|12|25|See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned {them} on earth, much more {shall not} we {escape} who turn away from him that {warneth} from heaven:
Hebrews|12|26|whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.
Hebrews|12|27|And this {word}, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
Hebrews|12|28|Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:
Hebrews|12|29|for our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews|13|1|Let love of the brethren continue.
Hebrews|13|2|Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
Hebrews|13|3|Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body.
Hebrews|13|4|{Let} marriage {be} had in honor among all, and {let} the bed {be} undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews|13|5|Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.
Hebrews|13|6|So that with good courage we say,             The Lord is my helper; I will not fear:                   What shall man do unto me?
Hebrews|13|7|Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.
Hebrews|13|8|Jesus Christ {is} the same yesterday and to-day, {yea} and for ever.
Hebrews|13|9|Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.
Hebrews|13|10|We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.
Hebrews|13|11|For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest {as an offering} for sin, are burned without the camp.
Hebrews|13|12|Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.
Hebrews|13|13|Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
Hebrews|13|14|For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after {the city} which is to come.
Hebrews|13|15|Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.
Hebrews|13|16|But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews|13|17|Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit {to them}: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this {were} unprofitable for you.
Hebrews|13|18|Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
Hebrews|13|19|And I exhort {you} the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews|13|20|Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, {even} our Lord Jesus,
Hebrews|13|21|make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom {be} the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews|13|22|But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words.
Hebrews|13|23|Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
Hebrews|13|24|Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
Hebrews|13|25|Grace be with you all. Amen.
1 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
1 Thessalonians|1|2|We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention {of you} in our prayers;
1 Thessalonians|1|3|remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
1 Thessalonians|1|4|knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,
1 Thessalonians|1|5|how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and {in} much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.
1 Thessalonians|1|6|And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|1|7|so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians|1|8|For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.
1 Thessalonians|1|9|For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
1 Thessalonians|1|10|and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, {even} Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
1 Thessalonians|2|1|For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:
1 Thessalonians|2|2|but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.
1 Thessalonians|2|3|For our exhortation {is} not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
1 Thessalonians|2|4|but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.
1 Thessalonians|2|5|For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;
1 Thessalonians|2|6|nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians|2|7|But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:
1 Thessalonians|2|8|even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.
1 Thessalonians|2|9|For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
1 Thessalonians|2|10|Ye are witnesses, and God {also}, how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:
1 Thessalonians|2|11|as ye know how we {dealt with} each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging {you}, and testifying,
1 Thessalonians|2|12|to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians|2|13|And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, {even the word} of God, ye accepted {it} not {as} the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.
1 Thessalonians|2|14|For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;
1 Thessalonians|2|15|who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all men;
1 Thessalonians|2|16|forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1 Thessalonians|2|17|But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:
1 Thessalonians|2|18|because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.
1 Thessalonians|2|19|For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
1 Thessalonians|2|20|For ye are our glory and our joy.
1 Thessalonians|3|1|Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;
1 Thessalonians|3|2|and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort {you} concerning your faith;
1 Thessalonians|3|3|that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.
1 Thessalonians|3|4|For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
1 Thessalonians|3|5|For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
1 Thessalonians|3|6|But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also {to see} you;
1 Thessalonians|3|7|for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:
1 Thessalonians|3|8|for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians|3|9|For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
1 Thessalonians|3|10|night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians|3|11|Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:
1 Thessalonians|3|12|and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also {do} toward you;
1 Thessalonians|3|13|to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1 Thessalonians|4|1|Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk, --that ye abound more and more.
1 Thessalonians|4|2|For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians|4|3|For this is the will of God, {even} your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;
1 Thessalonians|4|4|that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
1 Thessalonians|4|5|not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;
1 Thessalonians|4|6|that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
1 Thessalonians|4|7|For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
1 Thessalonians|4|8|Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.
1 Thessalonians|4|9|But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
1 Thessalonians|4|10|for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;
1 Thessalonians|4|11|and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;
1 Thessalonians|4|12|that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
1 Thessalonians|4|13|But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians|4|14|For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
1 Thessalonians|4|15|For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians|4|16|For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
1 Thessalonians|4|17|then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians|4|18|Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians|5|1|But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.
1 Thessalonians|5|2|For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|3|When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.
1 Thessalonians|5|4|But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
1 Thessalonians|5|5|for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
1 Thessalonians|5|6|so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
1 Thessalonians|5|7|For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|8|But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians|5|9|For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians|5|10|who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1 Thessalonians|5|11|Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.
1 Thessalonians|5|12|But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
1 Thessalonians|5|13|and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians|5|14|And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|15|See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|16|Rejoice always;
1 Thessalonians|5|17|pray without ceasing;
1 Thessalonians|5|18|in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.
1 Thessalonians|5|19|Quench not the Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|5|20|despise not prophesyings;
1 Thessalonians|5|21|prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
1 Thessalonians|5|22|abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians|5|23|And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians|5|24|Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.
1 Thessalonians|5|25|Brethren, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians|5|26|Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians|5|27|I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians|5|28|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Romans|1|1|Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called {to be} an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Romans|1|2|which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
Romans|1|3|concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans|1|4|who was declared {to be} the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead; {even} Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans|1|5|through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake;
Romans|1|6|among whom are ye also called {to be} Jesus Christ’s:
Romans|1|7|To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called {to be} saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|1|8|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
Romans|1|9|For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers
Romans|1|10|making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you.
Romans|1|11|For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
Romans|1|12|that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
Romans|1|13|And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans|1|14|I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans|1|15|So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.
Romans|1|16|For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
Romans|1|17|For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.
Romans|1|18|For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;
Romans|1|19|because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them.
Romans|1|20|For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, {even} his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:
Romans|1|21|because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
Romans|1|22|Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
Romans|1|23|and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
Romans|1|24|Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves:
Romans|1|25|for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|1|26|For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:
Romans|1|27|and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.
Romans|1|28|And even as they refused to have God in {their} knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
Romans|1|29|being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
Romans|1|30|backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Romans|1|31|without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:
Romans|1|32|who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.
Romans|2|1|Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.
Romans|2|2|And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.
Romans|2|3|And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
Romans|2|4|Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
Romans|2|5|but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
Romans|2|6|who will render to every man according to his works:
Romans|2|7|to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:
Romans|2|8|but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, {shall be} wrath and indignation,
Romans|2|9|tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
Romans|2|10|but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:
Romans|2|11|for there is no respect of persons with God.
Romans|2|12|For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
Romans|2|13|for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
Romans|2|14|(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;
Romans|2|15|in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing {them});
Romans|2|16|in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.
Romans|2|17|But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,
Romans|2|18|and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
Romans|2|19|and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,
Romans|2|20|a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;
Romans|2|21|thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
Romans|2|22|thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?
Romans|2|23|thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?
Romans|2|24|For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.
Romans|2|25|For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
Romans|2|26|If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?
Romans|2|27|and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?
Romans|2|28|For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
Romans|2|29|but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
Romans|3|1|What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?
Romans|3|2|Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.
Romans|3|3|For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?
Romans|3|4|God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written,             That thou mightest be justified in thy words,                   And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.
Romans|3|5|But if our righteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)
Romans|3|6|God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
Romans|3|7|But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
Romans|3|8|and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.
Romans|3|9|What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;
Romans|3|10|as it is written,             There is none righteous, no, not one;
Romans|3|11|There is none that understandeth,                   There is none that seeketh after God;
Romans|3|12|They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable;                   There is none that doeth good, no, not, so much as one:
Romans|3|13|Their throat is an open sepulchre;                   With their tongues they have used deceit:                   The poison of asps is under their lips:
Romans|3|14|Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
Romans|3|15|Their feet are swift to shed blood;
Romans|3|16|Destruction and misery are in their ways;
Romans|3|17|And the way of peace have they not known:
Romans|3|18|There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Romans|3|19|Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:
Romans|3|20|because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law {cometh} the knowledge of sin.
Romans|3|21|But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
Romans|3|22|even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;
Romans|3|23|for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;
Romans|3|24|being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Romans|3|25|whom God set forth {to be} a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;
Romans|3|26|for the showing, {I say}, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.
Romans|3|27|Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.
Romans|3|28|We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans|3|29|Or is God {the God} of Jews only? is he not {the God} of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:
Romans|3|30|if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.
Romans|3|31|Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.
Romans|4|1|What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?
Romans|4|2|For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.
Romans|4|3|For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Romans|4|4|Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.
Romans|4|5|But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
Romans|4|6|Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,
Romans|4|7|{saying},             Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,                   And whose sins are covered.
Romans|4|8|Blessed is the man to whom, the Lord will not reckon sin.
Romans|4|9|Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.
Romans|4|10|How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:
Romans|4|11|and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;
Romans|4|12|and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.
Romans|4|13|For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans|4|14|For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:
Romans|4|15|for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
Romans|4|16|For this cause {it is} of faith, that {it may be} according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
Romans|4|17|(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, {even} God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.
Romans|4|18|Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.
Romans|4|19|And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
Romans|4|20|yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,
Romans|4|21|and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
Romans|4|22|Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Romans|4|23|Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;
Romans|4|24|but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Romans|4|25|who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
Romans|5|1|Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
Romans|5|2|through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
Romans|5|3|And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;
Romans|5|4|and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:
Romans|5|5|and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.
Romans|5|6|For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans|5|7|For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.
Romans|5|8|But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans|5|9|Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath {of God} through him.
Romans|5|10|For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;
Romans|5|11|and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Romans|5|12|Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:--
Romans|5|13|for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Romans|5|14|Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.
Romans|5|15|But not as the trespass, so also {is} the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.
Romans|5|16|And not as through one that sinned, {so} is the gift: for the judgment {came} of one unto condemnation, but the free gift {came} of many trespasses unto justification.
Romans|5|17|For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, {even} Jesus Christ.
Romans|5|18|So then as through one trespass {the judgment came} unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness {the free gift came} unto all men to justification of life.
Romans|5|19|For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.
Romans|5|20|And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:
Romans|5|21|that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans|6|1|What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
Romans|6|2|God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?
Romans|6|3|Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans|6|4|We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
Romans|6|5|For if we have become united with {him} in the likeness of his death, we shall be also {in the likeness} of his resurrection;
Romans|6|6|knowing this, that our old man was crucified with {him}, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;
Romans|6|7|for he that hath died is justified from sin.
Romans|6|8|But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
Romans|6|9|knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.
Romans|6|10|For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
Romans|6|11|Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.
Romans|6|12|Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:
Romans|6|13|neither present your members unto sin {as} instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members {as} instruments of righteousness unto God.
Romans|6|14|For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
Romans|6|15|What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.
Romans|6|16|Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves {as} servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Romans|6|17|But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;
Romans|6|18|and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.
Romans|6|19|I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members {as} servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members {as} servants to righteousness unto sanctification.
Romans|6|20|For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.
Romans|6|21|What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
Romans|6|22|But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
Romans|6|23|For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|7|1|Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?
Romans|7|2|For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
Romans|7|3|So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.
Romans|7|4|Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, {even} to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.
Romans|7|5|For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
Romans|7|6|But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
Romans|7|7|What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:
Romans|7|8|but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin {is} dead.
Romans|7|9|And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;
Romans|7|10|and the commandment, which {was} unto life, this I found {to be} unto death:
Romans|7|11|for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.
Romans|7|12|So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
Romans|7|13|Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
Romans|7|14|For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Romans|7|15|For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.
Romans|7|16|But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.
Romans|7|17|So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|18|For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good {is} not.
Romans|7|19|For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.
Romans|7|20|But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|21|I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.
Romans|7|22|For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
Romans|7|23|but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
Romans|7|24|Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?
Romans|7|25|I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans|8|1|There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
Romans|8|2|For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans|8|3|For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
Romans|8|4|that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Romans|8|5|For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
Romans|8|6|For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:
Romans|8|7|because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:
Romans|8|8|and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans|8|9|But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Romans|8|10|And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans|8|11|But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
Romans|8|12|So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
Romans|8|13|for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
Romans|8|14|For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
Romans|8|15|For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
Romans|8|16|The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:
Romans|8|17|and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with {him}, that we may be also glorified with {him}.
Romans|8|18|For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.
Romans|8|19|For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans|8|20|For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope
Romans|8|21|that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
Romans|8|22|For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
Romans|8|23|And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for {our} adoption, {to wit}, the redemption of our body.
Romans|8|24|For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?
Romans|8|25|But if we hope for that which we see not, {then} do we with patience wait for it.
Romans|8|26|And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for {us} with groanings which cannot be uttered;
Romans|8|27|and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to {the will of} God.
Romans|8|28|And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, {even} to them that are called according to {his} purpose.
Romans|8|29|For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained {to be} conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:
Romans|8|30|and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
Romans|8|31|What then shall we say to these things? If God {is} for us, who {is} against us?
Romans|8|32|He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
Romans|8|33|Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;
Romans|8|34|who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
Romans|8|35|Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Romans|8|36|Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Romans|8|37|Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Romans|8|38|For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans|8|39|nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|9|1|I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
Romans|9|2|that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans|9|3|For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Romans|9|4|who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service {of God}, and the promises;
Romans|9|5|whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|9|6|But {it is} not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:
Romans|9|7|neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Romans|9|8|That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.
Romans|9|9|For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
Romans|9|10|And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, {even} by our father Isaac--
Romans|9|11|for {the children} being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,
Romans|9|12|it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
Romans|9|13|Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.
Romans|9|14|What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
Romans|9|15|For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
Romans|9|16|So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.
Romans|9|17|For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.
Romans|9|18|So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth.
Romans|9|19|Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?
Romans|9|20|Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?
Romans|9|21|Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
Romans|9|22|What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:
Romans|9|23|and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,
Romans|9|24|{even} us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
Romans|9|25|As he saith also in Hosea,             I will call that my people, which was not my people;                   And her beloved, that was not beloved.
Romans|9|26|And it shall be, {that} in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people,                   There shall they be called sons of the living God.
Romans|9|27|And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:
Romans|9|28|for the Lord will execute {his} word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.
Romans|9|29|And, as Isaiah hath said before,             Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,                   We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.
Romans|9|30|What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:
Romans|9|31|but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at {that} law.
Romans|9|32|Wherefore? Because {they sought it} not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;
Romans|9|33|even as it is written,             Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:                   And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
Romans|10|1|Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.
Romans|10|2|For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
Romans|10|3|For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Romans|10|4|For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.
Romans|10|5|For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.
Romans|10|6|But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)
Romans|10|7|or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)
Romans|10|8|But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
Romans|10|9|because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus {as} Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:
Romans|10|10|for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Romans|10|11|For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
Romans|10|12|For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same {Lord} is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:
Romans|10|13|for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Romans|10|14|How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans|10|15|and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!
Romans|10|16|But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
Romans|10|17|So belief {cometh} of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
Romans|10|18|But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,             Their sound went out into all the earth,                   And their words unto the ends of the world.
Romans|10|19|But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith,             I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,                   With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.
Romans|10|20|And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,             I was found of them that sought me not;                   I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.
Romans|10|21|But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
Romans|11|1|I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans|11|2|God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:
Romans|11|3|Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
Romans|11|4|But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
Romans|11|5|Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Romans|11|6|But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
Romans|11|7|What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:
Romans|11|8|according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.
Romans|11|9|And David saith,             Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,                   And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:
Romans|11|10|Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,                   And bow thou down their back always.
Romans|11|11|I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation {is come} unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
Romans|11|12|Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
Romans|11|13|But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
Romans|11|14|if by any means I may provoke to jealousy {them that are} my flesh, and may save some of them.
Romans|11|15|For if the casting away of them {is} the reconciling of the world, what {shall} the receiving {of them be}, but life from the dead?
Romans|11|16|And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans|11|17|But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;
Romans|11|18|glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.
Romans|11|19|Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Romans|11|20|Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
Romans|11|21|for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
Romans|11|22|Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
Romans|11|23|And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans|11|24|For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural {branches}, be grafted into their own olive tree?
Romans|11|25|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;
Romans|11|26|and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,             There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;                   He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
Romans|11|27|And this is my covenant unto them,                   When I shall take away their sins.
Romans|11|28|As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
Romans|11|29|For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.
Romans|11|30|For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
Romans|11|31|even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
Romans|11|32|For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
Romans|11|33|O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
Romans|11|34|For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
Romans|11|35|or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
Romans|11|36|For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him {be} the glory for ever. Amen.
Romans|12|1|I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, {which is} your spiritual service.
Romans|12|2|And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
Romans|12|3|For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.
Romans|12|4|For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:
Romans|12|5|so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
Romans|12|6|And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, {let us prophesy} according to the proportion of our faith;
Romans|12|7|or ministry, {let us give ourselves} to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;
Romans|12|8|or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, {let him do it} with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Romans|12|9|Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Romans|12|10|In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;
Romans|12|11|in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Romans|12|12|rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;
Romans|12|13|communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.
Romans|12|14|Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.
Romans|12|15|Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
Romans|12|16|Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Romans|12|17|Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.
Romans|12|18|If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.
Romans|12|19|Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath {of God}: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.
Romans|12|20|But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.
Romans|12|21|Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans|13|1|Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the {powers} that be are ordained of God.
Romans|13|2|Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.
Romans|13|3|For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:
Romans|13|4|for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.
Romans|13|5|Wherefore {ye} must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
Romans|13|6|For this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.
Romans|13|7|Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute {is due}; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
Romans|13|8|Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.
Romans|13|9|For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Romans|13|10|Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.
Romans|13|11|And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we {first} believed.
Romans|13|12|The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Romans|13|13|Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.
Romans|13|14|But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to {fulfil} the lusts {thereof}.
Romans|14|1|But him that is weak in faith receive ye, {yet} not for decision of scruples.
Romans|14|2|One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.
Romans|14|3|Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Romans|14|4|Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.
Romans|14|5|One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day {alike}. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
Romans|14|6|He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
Romans|14|7|For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.
Romans|14|8|For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
Romans|14|9|For to this end Christ died and lived {again}, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
Romans|14|10|But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
Romans|14|11|For it is written,             As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow,                   And every tongue shall confess to God.
Romans|14|12|So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Romans|14|13|Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.
Romans|14|14|I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Romans|14|15|For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.
Romans|14|16|Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Romans|14|17|for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans|14|18|For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.
Romans|14|19|So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.
Romans|14|20|Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
Romans|14|21|It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor {to do anything} whereby thy brother stumbleth.
Romans|14|22|The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.
Romans|14|23|But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because {he eateth} not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
Romans|15|1|Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Romans|15|2|Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.
Romans|15|3|For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
Romans|15|4|For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
Romans|15|5|Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:
Romans|15|6|that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|15|7|Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
Romans|15|8|For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises {given} unto the fathers,
Romans|15|9|and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written,             Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles,                   And sing unto thy name.
Romans|15|10|And again he saith,             Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
Romans|15|11|And again,             Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles;                   And let all the peoples praise him.
Romans|15|12|And again, Isaiah saith,             There shall be the root of Jesse,                   And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles;                   On him shall the Gentiles hope.
Romans|15|13|Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|14|And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Romans|15|15|But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,
Romans|15|16|that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|17|I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
Romans|15|18|For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
Romans|15|19|in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;
Romans|15|20|yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was {already} named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;
Romans|15|21|but, as it is written,             They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came,                   And they who have not heard shall understand.
Romans|15|22|Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:
Romans|15|23|but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,
Romans|15|24|whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--
Romans|15|25|but now, I {say}, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.
Romans|15|26|For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.
Romans|15|27|Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it {to them} also to minister unto them in carnal things.
Romans|15|28|When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.
Romans|15|29|And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
Romans|15|30|Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
Romans|15|31|that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and {that} my ministration which {I have} for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
Romans|15|32|that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.
Romans|15|33|Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans|16|1|I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:
Romans|16|2|that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and of mine own self.
Romans|16|3|Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans|16|4|who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:
Romans|16|5|and {salute} the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ.
Romans|16|6|Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on you.
Romans|16|7|Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.
Romans|16|8|Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Romans|16|9|Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Romans|16|10|Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them that are of the {household} of Aristobulus.
Romans|16|11|Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the {household} of Narcissus, that are in the Lord.
Romans|16|12|Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
Romans|16|13|Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Romans|16|14|Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.
Romans|16|15|Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
Romans|16|16|Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
Romans|16|17|Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.
Romans|16|18|For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.
Romans|16|19|For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil.
Romans|16|20|And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Romans|16|21|Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
Romans|16|22|I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Romans|16|23|Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
Romans|16|24|{The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.}
Romans|16|25|Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal,
Romans|16|26|but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith:
Romans|16|27|to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
John|1|1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John|1|2|The same was in the beginning with God.
John|1|3|All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.
John|1|4|In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John|1|5|And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
John|1|6|There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
John|1|7|The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
John|1|8|He was not the light, but {came} that he might bear witness of the light.
John|1|9|There was the true light, {even the light} which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
John|1|10|He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
John|1|11|He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.
John|1|12|But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, {even} to them that believe on his name:
John|1|13|who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John|1|14|And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.
John|1|15|John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.
John|1|16|For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.
John|1|17|For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John|1|18|No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared {him}.
John|1|19|And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?
John|1|20|And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.
John|1|21|And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
John|1|22|They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
John|1|23|He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.
John|1|24|And they had been sent from the Pharisees.
John|1|25|And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?
John|1|26|John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,
John|1|27|{even} he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
John|1|28|These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John|1|29|On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!
John|1|30|This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.
John|1|31|And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.
John|1|32|And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.
John|1|33|And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.
John|1|34|And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
John|1|35|Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;
John|1|36|and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!
John|1|37|And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John|1|38|And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?
John|1|39|He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.
John|1|40|One of the two that heard John {speak}, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
John|1|41|He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
John|1|42|He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
John|1|43|On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.
John|1|44|Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
John|1|45|Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
John|1|46|And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
John|1|47|Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
John|1|48|Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
John|1|49|Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.
John|1|50|Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
John|1|51|And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
John|2|1|And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
John|2|2|and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.
John|2|3|And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
John|2|4|And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
John|2|5|His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
John|2|6|Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.
John|2|7|Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
John|2|8|And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.
John|2|9|And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,
John|2|10|and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when {men} have drunk freely, {then} that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.
John|2|11|This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
John|2|12|After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and {his} brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.
John|2|13|And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|2|14|And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
John|2|15|and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;
John|2|16|and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
John|2|17|His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.
John|2|18|The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
John|2|19|Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
John|2|20|The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
John|2|21|But he spake of the temple of his body.
John|2|22|When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
John|2|23|Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.
John|2|24|But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,
John|2|25|and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
John|3|1|Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
John|3|2|the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.
John|3|3|Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John|3|4|Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
John|3|5|Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!
John|3|6|That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John|3|7|Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.
John|3|8|The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
John|3|9|Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
John|3|10|Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?
John|3|11|Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
John|3|12|If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
John|3|13|And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, {even} the Son of man, who is in heaven.
John|3|14|And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;
John|3|15|that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.
John|3|16|For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
John|3|17|For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.
John|3|18|He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John|3|19|And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
John|3|20|For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.
John|3|21|But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.
John|3|22|After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
John|3|23|And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
John|3|24|For John was not yet cast into prison.
John|3|25|There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.
John|3|26|And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
John|3|27|John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.
John|3|28|Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.
John|3|29|He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.
John|3|30|He must increase, but I must decrease.
John|3|31|He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
John|3|32|What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
John|3|33|He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to {this}, that God is true.
John|3|34|For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.
John|3|35|The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
John|3|36|He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.
John|4|1|When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John|4|2|(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),
John|4|3|he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
John|4|4|And he must needs pass through Samaria.
John|4|5|So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
John|4|6|and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
John|4|7|There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
John|4|8|For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.
John|4|9|The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John|4|10|Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
John|4|11|The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?
John|4|12|Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
John|4|13|Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
John|4|14|but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.
John|4|15|The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
John|4|16|Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
John|4|17|The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:
John|4|18|for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.
John|4|19|The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John|4|20|Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
John|4|21|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
John|4|22|Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
John|4|23|But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.
John|4|24|God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
John|4|25|The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.
John|4|26|Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am {he}.
John|4|27|And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?
John|4|28|So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,
John|4|29|Come, see a man, who told me all things that {ever} I did: can this be the Christ?
John|4|30|They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
John|4|31|In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
John|4|32|But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.
John|4|33|The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him {aught} to eat?
John|4|34|Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
John|4|35|Say not ye, There are yet four months, and {then} cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.
John|4|36|He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
John|4|37|For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
John|4|38|I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.
John|4|39|And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that {ever} I did.
John|4|40|So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
John|4|41|And many more believed because of his word;
John|4|42|and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
John|4|43|And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
John|4|44|For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
John|4|45|So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
John|4|46|He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John|4|47|When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought {him} that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
John|4|48|Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.
John|4|49|The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
John|4|50|Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.
John|4|51|And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.
John|4|52|So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John|4|53|So the father knew that {it was} at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
John|4|54|This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
John|5|1|After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|5|2|Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep {gate} a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.
John|5|3|In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, {waiting for the moving of the water.}
John|5|4|{for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.}
John|5|5|And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.
John|5|6|When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time {in that case}, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?
John|5|7|The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
John|5|8|Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|9|And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.
John|5|10|So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.
John|5|11|But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|12|They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up {thy bed}, and walk?
John|5|13|But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.
John|5|14|Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.
John|5|15|The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
John|5|16|And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
John|5|17|But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.
John|5|18|For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
John|5|19|Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.
John|5|20|For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.
John|5|21|For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.
John|5|22|For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;
John|5|23|that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.
John|5|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.
John|5|25|Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.
John|5|26|For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:
John|5|27|and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
John|5|28|Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,
John|5|29|and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
John|5|30|I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John|5|31|If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
John|5|32|It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
John|5|33|Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.
John|5|34|But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.
John|5|35|He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.
John|5|36|But the witness which I have is greater than {that of} John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
John|5|37|And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
John|5|38|And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
John|5|39|Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;
John|5|40|and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.
John|5|41|I receive not glory from men.
John|5|42|But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.
John|5|43|I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
John|5|44|How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that {cometh} from the only God ye seek not?
John|5|45|Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, {even} Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.
John|5|46|For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.
John|5|47|But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
John|6|1|After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is {the sea} of Tiberias.
John|6|2|And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.
John|6|3|And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
John|6|4|Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
John|6|5|Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?
John|6|6|And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
John|6|7|Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
John|6|8|One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,
John|6|9|There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?
John|6|10|Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
John|6|11|Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.
John|6|12|And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.
John|6|13|So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten.
John|6|14|When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.
John|6|15|Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.
John|6|16|And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;
John|6|17|and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John|6|18|And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.
John|6|19|When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.
John|6|20|But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
John|6|21|They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.
John|6|22|On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but {that} his disciples went away alone
John|6|23|(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):
John|6|24|when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
John|6|25|And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
John|6|26|Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.
John|6|27|Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.
John|6|28|They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?
John|6|29|Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
John|6|30|They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou?
John|6|31|Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.
John|6|32|Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.
John|6|33|For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
John|6|34|They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
John|6|35|Jesus said unto them. I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
John|6|36|But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.
John|6|37|All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
John|6|38|For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John|6|39|And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.
John|6|40|For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
John|6|41|The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.
John|6|42|And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven?
John|6|43|Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
John|6|44|No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.
John|6|45|It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.
John|6|46|Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father.
John|6|47|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.
John|6|48|I am the bread of life.
John|6|49|Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
John|6|50|This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
John|6|51|I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
John|6|52|The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
John|6|53|Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.
John|6|54|He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
John|6|55|For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
John|6|56|He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.
John|6|57|As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.
John|6|58|This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.
John|6|59|These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
John|6|60|Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard {this}, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
John|6|61|But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble?
John|6|62|{What} then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?
John|6|63|It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.
John|6|64|But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.
John|6|65|And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father.
John|6|66|Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
John|6|67|Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away?
John|6|68|Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
John|6|69|And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God.
John|6|70|Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?
John|6|71|Now he spake of Judas {the son} of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, {being} one of the twelve.
John|7|1|And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
John|7|2|Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
John|7|3|His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.
John|7|4|For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
John|7|5|For even his brethren did not believe on him.
John|7|6|Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
John|7|7|The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
John|7|8|Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.
John|7|9|And having said these things unto them, he abode {still} in Galilee.
John|7|10|But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
John|7|11|The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
John|7|12|And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.
John|7|13|Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
John|7|14|But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
John|7|15|The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
John|7|16|Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
John|7|17|If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or {whether} I speak from myself.
John|7|18|He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
John|7|19|Did not Moses give you the law, and {yet} none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?
John|7|20|The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
John|7|21|Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.
John|7|22|Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
John|7|23|If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?
John|7|24|Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
John|7|25|Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
John|7|26|And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
John|7|27|Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.
John|7|28|Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
John|7|29|I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
John|7|30|They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
John|7|31|But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?
John|7|32|The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.
John|7|33|Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.
John|7|34|Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
John|7|35|The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
John|7|36|What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
John|7|37|Now on the last day, the great {day} of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
John|7|38|He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
John|7|39|But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet {given}; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
John|7|40|{Some} of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
John|7|41|Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
John|7|42|Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
John|7|43|So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
John|7|44|And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
John|7|45|The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?
John|7|46|The officers answered, Never a man so spake.
John|7|47|The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?
John|7|48|Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?
John|7|49|But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.
John|7|50|Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),
John|7|51|Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?
John|7|52|They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
John|7|53|And they went every man unto his own house:
John|8|1|but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
John|8|2|And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
John|8|3|And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
John|8|4|they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.
John|8|5|Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?
John|8|6|And this they said, trying him, that they might have {whereof} to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|7|But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
John|8|8|And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|9|And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, {even} unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
John|8|10|And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
John|8|11|And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.
John|8|12|Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John|8|13|The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
John|8|14|Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
John|8|15|Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
John|8|16|Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
John|8|17|Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
John|8|18|I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
John|8|19|They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
John|8|20|These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
John|8|21|He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.
John|8|22|The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?
John|8|23|And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
John|8|24|I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am {he}, ye shall die in your sins.
John|8|25|They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
John|8|26|I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
John|8|27|They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.
John|8|28|Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am {he}, and {that} I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
John|8|29|And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
John|8|30|As he spake these things, many believed on him.
John|8|31|Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, {then} are ye truly my disciples;
John|8|32|and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
John|8|33|They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
John|8|34|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
John|8|35|And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
John|8|36|If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
John|8|37|I know that ye are Abraham’s seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
John|8|38|I speak the things which I have seen with {my} Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from {your} father.
John|8|39|They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
John|8|40|But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
John|8|41|Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, {even} God.
John|8|42|Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
John|8|43|Why do ye not understand my speech? {Even} because ye cannot hear my word.
John|8|44|Ye are of {your} father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
John|8|45|But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
John|8|46|Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?
John|8|47|He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear {them} not, because ye are not of God.
John|8|48|The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
John|8|49|Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
John|8|50|But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
John|8|51|Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
John|8|52|The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
John|8|53|Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
John|8|54|Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;
John|8|55|and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.
John|8|56|Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
John|8|57|The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
John|8|58|Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
John|8|59|They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
John|9|1|And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.
John|9|2|And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
John|9|3|Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
John|9|4|We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
John|9|5|When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John|9|6|When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,
John|9|7|and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
John|9|8|The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
John|9|9|Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am {he}.
John|9|10|They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?
John|9|11|He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.
John|9|12|And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.
John|9|13|They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
John|9|14|Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John|9|15|Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
John|9|16|Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.
John|9|17|They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
John|9|18|The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
John|9|19|and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
John|9|20|His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
John|9|21|but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.
John|9|22|These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him {to be} Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John|9|23|Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
John|9|24|So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
John|9|25|He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
John|9|26|They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?
John|9|27|He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?
John|9|28|And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
John|9|29|We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
John|9|30|The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and {yet} he opened mine eyes.
John|9|31|We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.
John|9|32|Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John|9|33|If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
John|9|34|They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
John|9|35|Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
John|9|36|He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?
John|9|37|Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.
John|9|38|And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
John|9|39|And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.
John|9|40|Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?
John|9|41|Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.
John|10|1|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
John|10|2|But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John|10|3|To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
John|10|4|When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
John|10|5|And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
John|10|6|This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
John|10|7|Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
John|10|8|All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
John|10|9|I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.
John|10|10|The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have {it} abundantly.
John|10|11|I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
John|10|12|He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth {them}:
John|10|13|{he fleeth} because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
John|10|14|I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,
John|10|15|even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John|10|16|And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.
John|10|17|Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
John|10|18|No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.
John|10|19|There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.
John|10|20|And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
John|10|21|Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
John|10|22|And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:
John|10|23|it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
John|10|24|The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
John|10|25|Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.
John|10|26|But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.
John|10|27|My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John|10|28|and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
John|10|29|My Father, who hath given {them} unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch {them} out of the Father’s hand.
John|10|30|I and the Father are one.
John|10|31|The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John|10|32|Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John|10|33|The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
John|10|34|Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?
John|10|35|If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
John|10|36|say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am {the} Son of God?
John|10|37|If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
John|10|38|But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
John|10|39|They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
John|10|40|And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there be abode.
John|10|41|And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
John|10|42|And many believed on him there.
John|11|1|Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
John|11|2|And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John|11|3|The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John|11|4|But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
John|11|5|Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John|11|6|When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.
John|11|7|Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
John|11|8|The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
John|11|9|Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John|11|10|But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
John|11|11|These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John|11|12|The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.
John|11|13|Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.
John|11|14|Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John|11|15|And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
John|11|16|Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John|11|17|So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
John|11|18|Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
John|11|19|and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
John|11|20|Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.
John|11|21|Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|22|And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
John|11|23|Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John|11|24|Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John|11|25|Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;
John|11|26|and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?
John|11|27|She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, {even} he that cometh into the world.
John|11|28|And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.
John|11|29|And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.
John|11|30|(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)
John|11|31|The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.
John|11|32|Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|33|When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews {also} weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
John|11|34|and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.
John|11|35|Jesus wept.
John|11|36|The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!
John|11|37|But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?
John|11|38|Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
John|11|39|Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been {dead} four days.
John|11|40|Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
John|11|41|So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.
John|11|42|And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.
John|11|43|And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
John|11|44|He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
John|11|45|Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.
John|11|46|But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
John|11|47|The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.
John|11|48|If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
John|11|49|But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
John|11|50|nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
John|11|51|Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
John|11|52|and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.
John|11|53|So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
John|11|54|Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.
John|11|55|Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.
John|11|56|They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?
John|11|57|Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.
John|12|1|Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
John|12|2|So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
John|12|3|Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
John|12|4|But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,
John|12|5|Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?
John|12|6|Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.
John|12|7|Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.
John|12|8|For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
John|12|9|The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John|12|10|But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
John|12|11|because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
John|12|12|On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John|12|13|took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.
John|12|14|And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
John|12|15|Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
John|12|16|These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
John|12|17|The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
John|12|18|For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.
John|12|19|The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.
John|12|20|Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:
John|12|21|these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
John|12|22|Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.
John|12|23|And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
John|12|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
John|12|25|He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
John|12|26|If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.
John|12|27|Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.
John|12|28|Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, {saying}, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
John|12|29|The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
John|12|30|Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
John|12|31|Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
John|12|32|And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.
John|12|33|But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|12|34|The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
John|12|35|Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
John|12|36|While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
John|12|37|But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:
John|12|38|that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,             Lord, who hath believed our report?                   And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
John|12|39|For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
John|12|40|He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;                   Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,                   And should turn,                   And I should heal them.
John|12|41|These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.
John|12|42|Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess {it}, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
John|12|43|for they loved the glory {that is} of men more than the glory {that is} of God.
John|12|44|And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
John|12|45|And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.
John|12|46|I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.
John|12|47|And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John|12|48|He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.
John|12|49|For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
John|12|50|And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.
John|13|1|Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
John|13|2|And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s {son}, to betray him,
John|13|3|{Jesus}, knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,
John|13|4|riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.
John|13|5|Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
John|13|6|So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John|13|7|Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.
John|13|8|Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
John|13|9|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
John|13|10|Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
John|13|11|For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
John|13|12|So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
John|13|13|Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
John|13|14|If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John|13|15|For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.
John|13|16|Verily, verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.
John|13|17|If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.
John|13|18|I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.
John|13|19|From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am {he}.
John|13|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
John|13|21|When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
John|13|22|The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
John|13|23|There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John|13|24|Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell {us} who it is of whom he speaketh.
John|13|25|He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
John|13|26|Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, {the son} of Simon Iscariot.
John|13|27|And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.
John|13|28|Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
John|13|29|For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John|13|30|He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
John|13|31|When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;
John|13|32|and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.
John|13|33|Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.
John|13|34|A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
John|13|35|By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
John|13|36|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.
John|13|37|Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.
John|13|38|Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
John|14|1|Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
John|14|2|In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
John|14|3|And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, {there} ye may be also.
John|14|4|And whither I go, ye know the way.
John|14|5|Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?
John|14|6|Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John|14|7|If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
John|14|8|Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
John|14|9|Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
John|14|10|Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.
John|14|11|Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
John|14|12|Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater {works} than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
John|14|13|And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John|14|14|If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
John|14|15|If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.
John|14|16|And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
John|14|17|{even} the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
John|14|18|I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.
John|14|19|Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.
John|14|20|In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
John|14|21|He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.
John|14|22|Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
John|14|23|Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
John|14|24|He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
John|14|25|These things have I spoken unto you, while {yet} abiding with you.
John|14|26|But the Comforter, {even} the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.
John|14|27|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
John|14|28|Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
John|14|29|And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
John|14|30|I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;
John|14|31|but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
John|15|1|I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
John|15|2|Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every {branch} that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.
John|15|3|Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you.
John|15|4|Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
John|15|5|I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.
John|15|6|If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
John|15|7|If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
John|15|8|Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and {so} shall ye be my disciples.
John|15|9|Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.
John|15|10|If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
John|15|11|These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and {that} your joy may be made full.
John|15|12|This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.
John|15|13|Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
John|15|14|Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.
John|15|15|No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.
John|15|16|Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and {that} your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
John|15|17|These things I command you, that ye may love one another.
John|15|18|If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before {it hated} you.
John|15|19|If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
John|15|20|Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
John|15|21|But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
John|15|22|If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John|15|23|He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
John|15|24|If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
John|15|25|But {this cometh to pass}, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
John|15|26|But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, {even} the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:
John|15|27|and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
John|16|1|These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.
John|16|2|They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God.
John|16|3|And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
John|16|4|But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.
John|16|5|But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
John|16|6|But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
John|16|7|Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
John|16|8|And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
John|16|9|of sin, because they believe not on me;
John|16|10|of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;
John|16|11|of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
John|16|12|I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
John|16|13|Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, {these} shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.
John|16|14|He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare {it} unto you.
John|16|15|All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare {it} unto you.
John|16|16|A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.
John|16|17|{Some} of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
John|16|18|They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.
John|16|19|Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
John|16|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
John|16|21|A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.
John|16|22|And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.
John|16|23|And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.
John|16|24|Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
John|16|25|These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.
John|16|26|In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;
John|16|27|for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
John|16|28|I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.
John|16|29|His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.
John|16|30|Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
John|16|31|Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
John|16|32|Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and {yet} I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
John|16|33|These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
John|17|1|These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee:
John|17|2|even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.
John|17|3|And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, {even} Jesus Christ.
John|17|4|I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.
John|17|5|And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
John|17|6|I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
John|17|7|Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:
John|17|8|for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received {them}, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
John|17|9|I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:
John|17|10|and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
John|17|11|And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we {are}.
John|17|12|While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
John|17|13|But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
John|17|14|I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John|17|15|I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil {one}.
John|17|16|They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
John|17|17|Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.
John|17|18|As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.
John|17|19|And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
John|17|20|Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;
John|17|21|that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, {art} in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
John|17|22|And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we {are} one;
John|17|23|I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.
John|17|24|Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
John|17|25|O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;
John|17|26|and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.
John|18|1|When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.
John|18|2|Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.
John|18|3|Judas then, having received the band {of soldiers}, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John|18|4|Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?
John|18|5|They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am {he}. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
John|18|6|When therefore he said unto them, I am {he}, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
John|18|7|Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
John|18|8|Jesus answered, I told you that I am {he}; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
John|18|9|that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.
John|18|10|Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.
John|18|11|Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
John|18|12|So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
John|18|13|and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John|18|14|Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
John|18|15|And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and {so did} another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
John|18|16|but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
John|18|17|The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also {one} of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.
John|18|18|Now the servants and the officers were standing {there}, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
John|18|19|The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
John|18|20|Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.
John|18|21|Why askest thou me? Ask them that have heard {me}, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.
John|18|22|And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
John|18|23|Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
John|18|24|Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
John|18|25|Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also {one} of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.
John|18|26|One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
John|18|27|Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.
John|18|28|They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
John|18|29|Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?
John|18|30|They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.
John|18|31|Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
John|18|32|that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|18|33|Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
John|18|34|Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?
John|18|35|Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
John|18|36|Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
John|18|37|Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
John|18|38|Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.
John|18|39|But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
John|18|40|They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)
John|19|1|Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
John|19|2|And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;
John|19|3|and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.
John|19|4|And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.
John|19|5|Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And {Pilate} saith unto them, Behold, the man!
John|19|6|When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify {him}, crucify {him}! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.
John|19|7|The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
John|19|8|When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;
John|19|9|and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John|19|10|Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?
John|19|11|Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.
John|19|12|Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
John|19|13|When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John|19|14|Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!
John|19|15|They therefore cried out, Away with {him}, away with {him}, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
John|19|16|Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.
John|19|17|They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:
John|19|18|where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
John|19|19|And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John|19|20|This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, {and} in Latin, {and} in Greek.
John|19|21|The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
John|19|22|Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
John|19|23|The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John|19|24|They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,             They parted my garments among them,                   And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
John|19|25|These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the {wife} of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John|19|26|When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
John|19|27|Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own {home}.
John|19|28|After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
John|19|29|There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.
John|19|30|When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
John|19|31|The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high {day}), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and {that} they might be taken away.
John|19|32|The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:
John|19|33|but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
John|19|34|howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.
John|19|35|And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.
John|19|36|For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
John|19|37|And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
John|19|38|And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave {him} leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.
John|19|39|And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
John|19|40|So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
John|19|41|Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.
John|19|42|There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.
John|20|1|Now on the first {day} of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.
John|20|2|She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
John|20|3|Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.
John|20|4|And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
John|20|5|and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.
John|20|6|Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,
John|20|7|and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
John|20|8|Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.
John|20|9|For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
John|20|10|So the disciples went away again unto their own home.
John|20|11|But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
John|20|12|and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John|20|13|And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
John|20|14|When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John|20|15|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
John|20|16|Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.
John|20|17|Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.
John|20|18|Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and {that} he had said these things unto her.
John|20|19|When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first {day} of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace {be} unto you.
John|20|20|And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
John|20|21|Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace {be} unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
John|20|22|And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:
John|20|23|whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever {sins} ye retain, they are retained.
John|20|24|But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John|20|25|The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
John|20|26|And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace {be} unto you.
John|20|27|Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach {hither} thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
John|20|28|Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
John|20|29|Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed {are} they that have not seen, and {yet} have believed.
John|20|30|Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:
John|20|31|but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.
John|21|1|After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested {himself} on this wise.
John|21|2|There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the {sons} of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
John|21|3|Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.
John|21|4|But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John|21|5|Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.
John|21|6|And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
John|21|7|That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
John|21|8|But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net {full} of fishes.
John|21|9|So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
John|21|10|Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.
John|21|11|Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.
John|21|12|Jesus saith unto them, Come {and} break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
John|21|13|Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.
John|21|14|This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
John|21|15|So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
John|21|16|He saith to him again a second time, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.
John|21|17|He saith unto him the third time, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John|21|18|Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
John|21|19|Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
John|21|20|Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?
John|21|21|Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
John|21|22|Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what {is that} to thee? Follow thou me.
John|21|23|This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what {is that} to thee?
John|21|24|This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.
John|21|25|And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.
Zephaniah|1|1|The word of Jehovah which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
Zephaniah|1|2|I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|3|I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|4|And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, {and} the name of the Chemarim with the priests;
Zephaniah|1|5|and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam;
Zephaniah|1|6|and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.
Zephaniah|1|7|Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.
Zephaniah|1|8|And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
Zephaniah|1|9|And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah|1|10|And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
Zephaniah|1|11|Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.
Zephaniah|1|12|And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.
Zephaniah|1|13|And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.
Zephaniah|1|14|The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, {even} the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.
Zephaniah|1|15|That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
Zephaniah|1|16|a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.
Zephaniah|1|17|And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
Zephaniah|1|18|Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.
Zephaniah|2|1|Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;
Zephaniah|2|2|before the decree bring forth, {before} the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.
Zephaniah|2|3|Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.
Zephaniah|2|4|For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
Zephaniah|2|5|Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|2|6|And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
Zephaniah|2|7|And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed {their flocks} thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.
Zephaniah|2|8|I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
Zephaniah|2|9|Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.
Zephaniah|2|10|This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.
Zephaniah|2|11|Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.
Zephaniah|2|12|Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
Zephaniah|2|13|And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
Zephaniah|2|14|And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; {their} voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.
Zephaniah|2|15|This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
Zephaniah|3|1|Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!
Zephaniah|3|2|She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah|3|3|Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.
Zephaniah|3|4|Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
