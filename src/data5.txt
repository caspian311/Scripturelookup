Matthew|10|19|But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
Matthew|10|20|For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
Matthew|10|21|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Matthew|10|22|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew|10|23|But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
Matthew|10|24|A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
Matthew|10|25|It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!
Matthew|10|26|Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Matthew|10|27|What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops.
Matthew|10|28|And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew|10|29|Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:
Matthew|10|30|but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew|10|31|Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew|10|32|Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|10|33|But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|10|34|Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
Matthew|10|35|For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:
Matthew|10|36|and a man’s foes {shall be} they of his own household.
Matthew|10|37|He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|38|And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|39|He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew|10|40|He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
Matthew|10|41|He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew|10|42|And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Matthew|11|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew|11|2|Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples
Matthew|11|3|and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Matthew|11|4|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:
Matthew|11|5|the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Matthew|11|6|And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
Matthew|11|7|And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Matthew|11|8|But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft {raiment}? Behold, they that wear soft {raiment} are in king’s houses.
Matthew|11|9|But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Matthew|11|10|This is he, of whom it is written,             Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,                   Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Matthew|11|11|Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew|11|12|And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.
Matthew|11|13|For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew|11|14|And if ye are willing to receive {it,} this is Elijah, that is to come.
Matthew|11|15|He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|11|16|But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows
Matthew|11|17|and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.
Matthew|11|18|For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.
Matthew|11|19|The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.
Matthew|11|20|Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
Matthew|11|21|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew|11|22|But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew|11|23|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.
Matthew|11|24|But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
Matthew|11|25|At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:
Matthew|11|26|yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Matthew|11|27|All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal {him.}
Matthew|11|28|Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Matthew|11|29|Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
Matthew|11|30|For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
Matthew|12|1|At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.
Matthew|12|2|But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.
Matthew|12|3|But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;
Matthew|12|4|how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?
Matthew|12|5|Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?
Matthew|12|6|But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.
Matthew|12|7|But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew|12|8|For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
Matthew|12|9|And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:
Matthew|12|10|and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.
Matthew|12|11|And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
Matthew|12|12|How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
Matthew|12|13|Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
Matthew|12|14|But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
Matthew|12|15|And Jesus perceiving {it} withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,
Matthew|12|16|and charged them that they should not make him known:
Matthew|12|17|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|12|18|Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;                   My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:                   I will put my Spirit upon him,                   And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.
Matthew|12|19|He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;                   Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
Matthew|12|20|A bruised reed shall he not break,                   And smoking flax shall he not quench,                   Till he send forth judgment unto victory.
Matthew|12|21|And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
Matthew|12|22|Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.
Matthew|12|23|And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?
Matthew|12|24|But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
Matthew|12|25|And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
Matthew|12|26|and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
Matthew|12|27|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Matthew|12|28|But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Matthew|12|29|Or how can one enter into the house of the strong {man,} and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong {man}? and then he will spoil his house.
Matthew|12|30|He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Matthew|12|31|Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
Matthew|12|32|And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.
Matthew|12|33|Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.
Matthew|12|34|Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
Matthew|12|35|The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
Matthew|12|36|And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
Matthew|12|37|For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
Matthew|12|38|Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.
Matthew|12|39|But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
Matthew|12|40|for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew|12|41|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Matthew|12|42|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Matthew|12|43|But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.
Matthew|12|44|Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
Matthew|12|45|Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.
Matthew|12|46|While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
