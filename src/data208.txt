Numbers|33|53|and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.
Numbers|33|54|And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
