John|19|36|For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
John|19|37|And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
John|19|38|And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave {him} leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.
John|19|39|And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
John|19|40|So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
John|19|41|Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.
John|19|42|There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.
John|20|1|Now on the first {day} of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.
John|20|2|She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
John|20|3|Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.
John|20|4|And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
John|20|5|and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.
John|20|6|Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,
John|20|7|and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
John|20|8|Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.
John|20|9|For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
John|20|10|So the disciples went away again unto their own home.
John|20|11|But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
John|20|12|and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John|20|13|And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
John|20|14|When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John|20|15|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
John|20|16|Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.
John|20|17|Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.
John|20|18|Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and {that} he had said these things unto her.
John|20|19|When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first {day} of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace {be} unto you.
John|20|20|And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
John|20|21|Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace {be} unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
John|20|22|And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:
John|20|23|whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever {sins} ye retain, they are retained.
John|20|24|But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John|20|25|The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
John|20|26|And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace {be} unto you.
John|20|27|Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach {hither} thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
John|20|28|Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
John|20|29|Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed {are} they that have not seen, and {yet} have believed.
John|20|30|Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:
John|20|31|but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.
John|21|1|After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested {himself} on this wise.
John|21|2|There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the {sons} of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
John|21|3|Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.
John|21|4|But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John|21|5|Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.
John|21|6|And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
John|21|7|That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
John|21|8|But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net {full} of fishes.
John|21|9|So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
John|21|10|Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.
John|21|11|Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.
John|21|12|Jesus saith unto them, Come {and} break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
John|21|13|Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.
John|21|14|This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
John|21|15|So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
John|21|16|He saith to him again a second time, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.
John|21|17|He saith unto him the third time, Simon, {son} of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John|21|18|Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
John|21|19|Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
John|21|20|Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?
John|21|21|Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
John|21|22|Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what {is that} to thee? Follow thou me.
John|21|23|This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what {is that} to thee?
John|21|24|This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.
John|21|25|And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.
Zephaniah|1|1|The word of Jehovah which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
Zephaniah|1|2|I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|3|I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|4|And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, {and} the name of the Chemarim with the priests;
Zephaniah|1|5|and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam;
Zephaniah|1|6|and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.
Zephaniah|1|7|Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.
Zephaniah|1|8|And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
Zephaniah|1|9|And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah|1|10|And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
Zephaniah|1|11|Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.
Zephaniah|1|12|And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.
Zephaniah|1|13|And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.
Zephaniah|1|14|The great day of Jehovah is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, {even} the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.
Zephaniah|1|15|That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
Zephaniah|1|16|a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.
Zephaniah|1|17|And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
Zephaniah|1|18|Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.
Zephaniah|2|1|Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;
Zephaniah|2|2|before the decree bring forth, {before} the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.
Zephaniah|2|3|Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.
Zephaniah|2|4|For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
Zephaniah|2|5|Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|2|6|And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
Zephaniah|2|7|And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed {their flocks} thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.
Zephaniah|2|8|I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
Zephaniah|2|9|Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.
Zephaniah|2|10|This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.
Zephaniah|2|11|Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.
Zephaniah|2|12|Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
Zephaniah|2|13|And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
Zephaniah|2|14|And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; {their} voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.
Zephaniah|2|15|This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
Zephaniah|3|1|Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!
Zephaniah|3|2|She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah|3|3|Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.
Zephaniah|3|4|Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
