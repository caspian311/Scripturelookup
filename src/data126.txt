1 Kings|2|5|Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1 Kings|2|6|Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
1 Kings|2|7|But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.
1 Kings|2|8|And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
1 Kings|2|9|Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
1 Kings|2|10|And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings|2|11|And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1 Kings|2|12|And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1 Kings|2|13|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
1 Kings|2|14|He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
1 Kings|2|15|And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|16|And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
1 Kings|2|17|And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
1 Kings|2|18|And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
1 Kings|2|19|Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
1 Kings|2|20|Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.
1 Kings|2|21|And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
1 Kings|2|22|And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
1 Kings|2|23|Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
1 Kings|2|24|Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
1 Kings|2|25|And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.
1 Kings|2|26|And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
1 Kings|2|27|So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, that he might fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
1 Kings|2|28|And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|2|29|And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
1 Kings|2|30|And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
1 Kings|2|31|And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.
1 Kings|2|32|And Jehovah will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not, {to wit}, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
1 Kings|2|33|So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|34|Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings|2|35|And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
1 Kings|2|36|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
1 Kings|2|37|For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|38|And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1 Kings|2|39|And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
1 Kings|2|40|And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
1 Kings|2|41|And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
1 Kings|2|42|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good.
1 Kings|2|43|Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
1 Kings|2|44|The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|45|But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.
1 Kings|2|46|So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1 Kings|3|1|And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
1 Kings|3|2|Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.
1 Kings|3|3|And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1 Kings|3|4|And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1 Kings|3|5|In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
1 Kings|3|6|And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1 Kings|3|7|And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.
1 Kings|3|8|And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1 Kings|3|9|Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy great people?
1 Kings|3|10|And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1 Kings|3|11|And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;
1 Kings|3|12|behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
1 Kings|3|13|And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.
1 Kings|3|14|And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1 Kings|3|15|And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream: and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
1 Kings|3|16|Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
1 Kings|3|17|And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1 Kings|3|18|And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
1 Kings|3|19|And this woman’s child died in the night, because she lay upon it.
1 Kings|3|20|And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1 Kings|3|21|And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.
1 Kings|3|22|And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
1 Kings|3|23|Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
1 Kings|3|24|And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1 Kings|3|25|And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1 Kings|3|26|Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.
1 Kings|3|27|Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
1 Kings|3|28|And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
1 Kings|4|1|And king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings|4|2|And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
1 Kings|4|3|Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
1 Kings|4|4|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
1 Kings|4|5|and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, {and} the king’s friend;
1 Kings|4|6|and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork.
1 Kings|4|7|And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.
1 Kings|4|8|And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
1 Kings|4|9|Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
1 Kings|4|10|Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him {pertained} Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);
1 Kings|4|11|Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|12|Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
1 Kings|4|13|Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him {pertained} the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; {even} to him {pertained} the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);
1 Kings|4|14|Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1 Kings|4|15|Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|16|Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
1 Kings|4|17|Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1 Kings|4|18|Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
1 Kings|4|19|Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and {he was} the only officer that was in the land.
1 Kings|4|20|Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
1 Kings|4|21|And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1 Kings|4|22|And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
1 Kings|4|23|ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.
1 Kings|4|24|For he had dominion over all {the region} on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
1 Kings|4|25|And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|4|26|And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
1 Kings|4|27|And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
1 Kings|4|28|Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where {the officers} were, every man according to his charge.
1 Kings|4|29|And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
1 Kings|4|30|And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
