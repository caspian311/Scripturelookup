Deuteronomy|28|68|And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
Deuteronomy|29|1|These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
Deuteronomy|29|2|And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy|29|3|the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
Deuteronomy|29|4|but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
Deuteronomy|29|5|And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot.
Deuteronomy|29|6|Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|29|7|And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:
Deuteronomy|29|8|and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
Deuteronomy|29|9|Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
Deuteronomy|29|10|Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
Deuteronomy|29|11|your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water;
Deuteronomy|29|12|that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;
Deuteronomy|29|13|that he may establish thee this day unto himself for a people, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he spake unto thee, and as he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Deuteronomy|29|14|Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
Deuteronomy|29|15|but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day
Deuteronomy|29|16|(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;
Deuteronomy|29|17|and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
Deuteronomy|29|18|lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
Deuteronomy|29|19|and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.
Deuteronomy|29|20|Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.
Deuteronomy|29|21|And Jehovah will set him apart unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
Deuteronomy|29|22|And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;
Deuteronomy|29|23|{and that} the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, {and} a burning, {that} it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
Deuteronomy|29|24|even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
Deuteronomy|29|25|Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
Deuteronomy|29|26|and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:
Deuteronomy|29|27|therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;
Deuteronomy|29|28|and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|29|29|The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy|30|1|And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,
Deuteronomy|30|2|and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
Deuteronomy|30|3|that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.
Deuteronomy|30|4|If {any of} thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
Deuteronomy|30|5|and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
Deuteronomy|30|6|And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
Deuteronomy|30|7|And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.
Deuteronomy|30|8|And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy|30|9|And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|30|10|if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy|30|11|For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
Deuteronomy|30|12|It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|13|Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|14|But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
Deuteronomy|30|15|See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
Deuteronomy|30|16|in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|17|But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
Deuteronomy|30|18|I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|19|I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;
Deuteronomy|30|20|to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
Deuteronomy|31|1|And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|2|And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy|31|3|Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: {and} Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Deuteronomy|31|4|And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.
Deuteronomy|31|5|And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy|31|6|Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Deuteronomy|31|7|And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|31|8|And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy|31|9|And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|10|And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of {every} seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
Deuteronomy|31|11|when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy|31|12|Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
Deuteronomy|31|13|and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy|31|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy|31|15|And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
Deuteronomy|31|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy|31|17|Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
Deuteronomy|31|18|And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
Deuteronomy|31|19|Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|20|For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
Deuteronomy|31|21|And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
Deuteronomy|31|22|So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|23|And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
Deuteronomy|31|24|And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
Deuteronomy|31|25|that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
Deuteronomy|31|26|Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
Deuteronomy|31|27|For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?
Deuteronomy|31|28|Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy|31|29|For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy|31|30|And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
Deuteronomy|32|1|Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;                   And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
Deuteronomy|32|2|My doctrine shall drop as the rain;                   My speech shall distil as the dew,                   As the small rain upon the tender grass,                   And as the showers upon the herb.
Deuteronomy|32|3|For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah:                   Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
Deuteronomy|32|4|The Rock, his work is perfect;                   For all his ways are justice:                   A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,                   Just and right is he.
Deuteronomy|32|5|They have dealt corruptly with him, {they are} not his children, {it is} their blemish;                           {They are} a perverse and crooked generation.
Deuteronomy|32|6|Do ye thus requite Jehovah,                   O foolish people and unwise?                   Is not he thy father that hath bought thee?                   He hath made thee, and established thee.
Deuteronomy|32|7|Remember the days of old,                   Consider the years of many generations:                   Ask thy father, and he will show thee;                   Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
Deuteronomy|32|8|When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,                   When he separated the children of men,                   He set the bounds of the peoples                   According to the number of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|32|9|For Jehovah’s portion is his people;                   Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
Deuteronomy|32|10|He found him in a desert land,                   And in the waste howling wilderness;                   He compassed him about, he cared for him,                   He kept him as the apple of his eye.
Deuteronomy|32|11|As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,                   That fluttereth over her young,                   He spread abroad his wings, he took them,                   He bare them on his pinions.
Deuteronomy|32|12|Jehovah alone did lead him,                   And there was no foreign god with him.
Deuteronomy|32|13|He made him ride on the high places of the earth,                   And he did eat the increase of the field;                   And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,                   And oil out of the flinty rock;
Deuteronomy|32|14|Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,                   With fat of lambs,                   And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,                   With the finest of the wheat;                   And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
Deuteronomy|32|15|But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:                   Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek;                   Then he forsook God who made him,                   And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
Deuteronomy|32|16|They moved him to jealousy with strange {gods};                   With abominations provoked they him to anger.
Deuteronomy|32|17|They sacrificed unto demons, {which were} no God,                   To gods that they knew not,                   To new {gods} that came up of late,                   Which your fathers dreaded not.
Deuteronomy|32|18|Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,                   And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.
Deuteronomy|32|19|And Jehovah saw {it}, and abhorred {them},                   Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
Deuteronomy|32|20|And he said, I will hide my face from them,                   I will see what their end shall be:                   For they are a very perverse generation,                   Children in whom is no faithfulness.
