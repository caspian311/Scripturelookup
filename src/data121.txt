Joshua|11|7|So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
Joshua|11|8|And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
Joshua|11|9|And Joshua did unto them as Jehovah bade him: he hocked their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
Joshua|11|10|And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua|11|11|And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
Joshua|11|12|And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.
Joshua|11|13|But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
Joshua|11|14|And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.
Joshua|11|15|As Jehovah commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua: and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah commanded Moses.
Joshua|11|16|So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
Joshua|11|17|from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.
Joshua|11|18|Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua|11|19|There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.
Joshua|11|20|For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Joshua|11|21|And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
Joshua|11|22|There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
Joshua|11|23|So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah spake unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua|12|1|Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:
Joshua|12|2|Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and {the city that is in} the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|12|3|and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
Joshua|12|4|and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Joshua|12|5|and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua|12|6|Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel smote them: and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|12|7|And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
Joshua|12|8|in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Joshua|12|9|the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|10|the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua|12|11|the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua|12|12|the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua|12|13|the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua|12|14|the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua|12|15|the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua|12|16|the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|17|the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua|12|18|the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
Joshua|12|19|the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua|12|20|the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua|12|21|the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua|12|22|the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua|12|23|the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua|12|24|the king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
Joshua|13|1|Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
Joshua|13|2|This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
Joshua|13|3|from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward, {which} is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,
Joshua|13|4|on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;
Joshua|13|5|and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath;
Joshua|13|6|all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Joshua|13|7|Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|13|8|With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:
Joshua|13|9|from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
Joshua|13|10|and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|13|11|and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;
Joshua|13|12|all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out.
Joshua|13|13|Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.
Joshua|13|14|Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings of Jehovah, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as he spake unto him.
Joshua|13|15|And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua|13|16|And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Joshua|13|17|Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
Joshua|13|18|and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Joshua|13|19|and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
Joshua|13|20|and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
Joshua|13|21|and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.
Joshua|13|22|Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua|13|23|And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border {thereof}. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua|13|24|And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families.
Joshua|13|25|And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
Joshua|13|26|and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
Joshua|13|27|and in the valley, Beth-haram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border {thereof}, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
Joshua|13|28|This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
Joshua|13|29|And Moses gave {inheritance} unto the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua|13|30|And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
Joshua|13|31|and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir according to their families.
Joshua|13|32|These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
Joshua|13|33|But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance: Jehovah, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spake unto them.
Joshua|14|1|And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,
Joshua|14|2|by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
Joshua|14|3|For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
Joshua|14|4|For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
Joshua|14|5|As Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.
Joshua|14|6|Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua|14|7|Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
Joshua|14|8|Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|9|And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|10|And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
Joshua|14|11|As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
Joshua|14|12|Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof Jehovah spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Jehovah spake.
Joshua|14|13|And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua|14|14|Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Joshua|14|15|Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; {which Arba was} the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
Joshua|15|1|And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
Joshua|15|2|And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;
Joshua|15|3|and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;
Joshua|15|4|and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border.
Joshua|15|5|And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;
Joshua|15|6|and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|15|7|and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel;
Joshua|15|8|and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward;
Joshua|15|9|and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim);
Joshua|15|10|and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;
Joshua|15|11|and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
