Exodus|39|25|And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;
Exodus|39|26|a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|27|And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
Exodus|39|28|and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,
Exodus|39|29|and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|30|And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.
Exodus|39|31|And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|39|32|Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.
Exodus|39|33|And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;
Exodus|39|34|and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;
Exodus|39|35|the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;
Exodus|39|36|the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;
Exodus|39|37|the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;
Exodus|39|38|and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;
Exodus|39|39|the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;
Exodus|39|40|the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
Exodus|39|41|the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.
Exodus|39|42|According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.
Exodus|39|43|And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
Exodus|40|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|40|2|On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|40|3|And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.
Exodus|40|4|And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
Exodus|40|5|And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|6|And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|40|7|And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
Exodus|40|8|And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
Exodus|40|9|And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.
Exodus|40|10|And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.
Exodus|40|11|And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.
Exodus|40|12|And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.
Exodus|40|13|And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
Exodus|40|14|And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;
Exodus|40|15|and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
Exodus|40|16|Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
Exodus|40|17|And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
Exodus|40|18|And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.
Exodus|40|19|And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|20|And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
Exodus|40|21|and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|22|And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
Exodus|40|23|And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|24|And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
Exodus|40|25|And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|26|And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:
Exodus|40|27|and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|28|And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|29|And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|30|And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.
Exodus|40|31|And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;
Exodus|40|32|when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|33|And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
Exodus|40|34|Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|35|And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|36|And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:
Exodus|40|37|but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
Exodus|40|38|For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
2 Peter|1|1|Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and {the} Saviour Jesus Christ:
2 Peter|1|2|Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
2 Peter|1|3|seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;
2 Peter|1|4|whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust.
2 Peter|1|5|Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in {your} virtue knowledge;
2 Peter|1|6|and in {your} knowledge self-control; and in {your} self-control patience; and in {your} patience godliness;
2 Peter|1|7|and in {your} godliness brotherly kindness; and in {your} brotherly kindness love.
2 Peter|1|8|For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|9|For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
2 Peter|1|10|Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:
2 Peter|1|11|for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|12|Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with {you}.
2 Peter|1|13|And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
2 Peter|1|14|knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.
2 Peter|1|15|Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
2 Peter|1|16|For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2 Peter|1|17|For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:
2 Peter|1|18|and this voice we {ourselves} heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
2 Peter|1|19|And we have the word of prophecy {made} more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:
2 Peter|1|20|knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
2 Peter|1|21|For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
2 Peter|2|1|But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter|2|2|And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.
2 Peter|2|3|And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
2 Peter|2|4|For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
2 Peter|2|5|and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2 Peter|2|6|and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;
2 Peter|2|7|and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked
2 Peter|2|8|(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed {his} righteous soul from day to day with {their} lawless deeds):
2 Peter|2|9|the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;
2 Peter|2|10|but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:
2 Peter|2|11|whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter|2|12|But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,
2 Peter|2|13|suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; {men} that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you;
2 Peter|2|14|having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;
2 Peter|2|15|forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the {son} of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;
2 Peter|2|16|but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter|2|17|These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.
2 Peter|2|18|For, uttering great swelling {words} of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;
2 Peter|2|19|promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.
2 Peter|2|20|For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.
2 Peter|2|21|For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
2 Peter|2|22|It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
