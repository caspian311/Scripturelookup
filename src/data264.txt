Leviticus|26|45|but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|26|46|These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.
Leviticus|27|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|27|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|3|And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|27|4|And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus|27|5|And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|6|And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|7|And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|8|But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.
Leviticus|27|9|And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|10|He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|11|And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;
Leviticus|27|12|and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
Leviticus|27|13|But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|14|And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
Leviticus|27|15|And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
Leviticus|27|16|And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley {shall be valued} at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|17|If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
Leviticus|27|18|But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|19|And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
Leviticus|27|20|And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:
Leviticus|27|21|but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
Leviticus|27|22|And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;
Leviticus|27|23|then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|24|In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.
Leviticus|27|25|And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus|27|26|Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|27|27|And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|28|Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|29|No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|27|30|And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s: it is holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|31|And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.
Leviticus|27|32|And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|33|He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leviticus|27|34|These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
2 Corinthians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:
2 Corinthians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|3|Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
2 Corinthians|1|4|who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
2 Corinthians|1|5|For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|6|But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:
2 Corinthians|1|7|and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.
2 Corinthians|1|8|For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell {us} in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
2 Corinthians|1|9|yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
2 Corinthians|1|10|who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
2 Corinthians|1|11|ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
2 Corinthians|1|12|For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
2 Corinthians|1|13|For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:
2 Corinthians|1|14|as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2 Corinthians|1|15|And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;
2 Corinthians|1|16|and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.
2 Corinthians|1|17|When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?
2 Corinthians|1|18|But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.
2 Corinthians|1|19|For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, {even} by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.
2 Corinthians|1|20|For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.
2 Corinthians|1|21|Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
2 Corinthians|1|22|who also sealed us, and gave {us} the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2 Corinthians|1|23|But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.
2 Corinthians|1|24|Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.
2 Corinthians|2|1|But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|2|For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?
2 Corinthians|2|3|And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is {the joy} of you all.
2 Corinthians|2|4|For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.
2 Corinthians|2|5|But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.
2 Corinthians|2|6|Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was {inflicted} by the many;
2 Corinthians|2|7|so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|8|Wherefore I beseech you to confirm {your} love toward him.
2 Corinthians|2|9|For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
2 Corinthians|2|10|But to whom ye forgive anything, I {forgive} also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes {have I forgiven it} in the presence of Christ;
2 Corinthians|2|11|that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians|2|12|Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,
2 Corinthians|2|13|I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
2 Corinthians|2|14|But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.
2 Corinthians|2|15|For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;
2 Corinthians|2|16|to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians|2|17|For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.
2 Corinthians|3|1|Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?
2 Corinthians|3|2|Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;
2 Corinthians|3|3|being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables {that are} hearts of flesh.
2 Corinthians|3|4|And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:
2 Corinthians|3|5|not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
2 Corinthians|3|6|who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2 Corinthians|3|7|But if the ministration of death, written, {and} engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which {glory} was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|8|how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?
2 Corinthians|3|9|For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|10|For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.
2 Corinthians|3|11|For if that which passeth away {was} with glory, much more that which remaineth {is} in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|12|Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
2 Corinthians|3|13|and {are} not as Moses, {who} put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|14|but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed {to them} that it is done away in Christ.
2 Corinthians|3|15|But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.
2 Corinthians|3|16|But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
2 Corinthians|3|17|Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, {there} is liberty.
2 Corinthians|3|18|But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.
2 Corinthians|4|1|Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:
2 Corinthians|4|2|but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians|4|3|And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:
2 Corinthians|4|4|in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn {upon them}.
2 Corinthians|4|5|For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
