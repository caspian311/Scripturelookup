Judges|21|22|And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain unto us, that we will say unto them, Grant them graciously unto us, because we took not for each man {of them} his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now be guilty.
Judges|21|23|And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
Judges|21|24|And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
Judges|21|25|In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Revelation|1|1|The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show unto his servants, {even} the things which must shortly come to pass: and he sent and signified {it} by his angel unto his servant John;
Revelation|1|2|who bare witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, {even} of all things that he saw.
Revelation|1|3|Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written therein: for the time is at hand.
Revelation|1|4|John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne;
Revelation|1|5|and from Jesus Christ, {who is} the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins by his blood;
Revelation|1|6|and he made us {to be} a kingdom, {to be} priests unto his God and Father; to him {be} the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Revelation|1|7|Behold, he cometh with the clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they that pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn over him. Even so, Amen.
Revelation|1|8|I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
Revelation|1|9|I John, your brother and partaker with you in tribulation and kingdom and patience {which are} in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation|1|10|I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet
Revelation|1|11|saying, What thou seest, write in a book and send {it} to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
Revelation|1|12|And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;
Revelation|1|13|and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation|1|14|And his head and his hair were white as white wool, {white} as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
Revelation|1|15|and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.
Revelation|1|16|And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
Revelation|1|17|And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as one dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not; I am the first and the last,
Revelation|1|18|and the Living one; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Revelation|1|19|Write therefore the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which shall come to pass hereafter;
Revelation|1|20|the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches.
Revelation|2|1|To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:
Revelation|2|2|I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false;
Revelation|2|3|and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name’s sake, and hast not grown weary.
Revelation|2|4|But I have {this} against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love.
Revelation|2|5|Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.
Revelation|2|6|But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Revelation|2|7|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.
Revelation|2|8|And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived {again}:
Revelation|2|9|I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they art not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation|2|10|Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
Revelation|2|11|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
Revelation|2|12|and to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:
Revelation|2|13|I know where thou dwellest, {even} where Satan’s throne is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth.
Revelation|2|14|But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
Revelation|2|15|So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.
Revelation|2|16|Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
Revelation|2|17|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
Revelation|2|18|And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass:
Revelation|2|19|I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.
Revelation|2|20|But I have {this} against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
Revelation|2|21|And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication.
Revelation|2|22|Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.
Revelation|2|23|And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.
Revelation|2|24|But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden.
Revelation|2|25|Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
Revelation|2|26|And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:
Revelation|2|27|and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:
Revelation|2|28|and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation|2|29|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|1|And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead.
Revelation|3|2|Be thou watchful, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine perfected before my God.
Revelation|3|3|Remember therefore how thou hast received and didst hear; and keep {it}, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
Revelation|3|4|But thou hast a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.
Revelation|3|5|He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
Revelation|3|6|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|7|And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth:
Revelation|3|8|I know thy works (behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name.
Revelation|3|9|Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
Revelation|3|10|Because thou didst keep the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial, that {hour} which is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Revelation|3|11|I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.
Revelation|3|12|He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and mine own new name.
Revelation|3|13|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|14|And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
Revelation|3|15|I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
Revelation|3|16|So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
Revelation|3|17|Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked:
Revelation|3|18|I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined by fire, that thou mayest become rich; and white garments, that thou mayest clothe thyself, and {that} the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see.
Revelation|3|19|As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
Revelation|3|20|Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
Revelation|3|21|He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.
Revelation|3|22|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|4|1|After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, {a voice} as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.
Revelation|4|2|Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;
Revelation|4|3|and he that sat {was} to look upon like a jasper stone and a sardius: and {there was} a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.
Revelation|4|4|And round about the throne {were} four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones {I saw} four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.
Revelation|4|5|And out of the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders. And {there was} seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
Revelation|4|6|and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
Revelation|4|7|And the first creature {was} like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face as of a man, and the fourth creature {was} like a flying eagle.
Revelation|4|8|and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and within: and they have no rest day and night, saying,      Holy, holy, holy, {is} the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.
Revelation|4|9|And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,
Revelation|4|10|the four and twenty elders shall fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and shall worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Revelation|4|11|Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power: for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they were, and were created.
Revelation|5|1|And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.
Revelation|5|2|And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
Revelation|5|3|And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
Revelation|5|4|And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:
Revelation|5|5|and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
Revelation|5|6|And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
Revelation|5|7|And he came, and he taketh {it} out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
Revelation|5|8|And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation|5|9|And they sing a new song, saying,      Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood {men} of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
Revelation|5|10|and madest them {to be} unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth.
Revelation|5|11|And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
Revelation|5|12|saying with a great voice,      Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing.
Revelation|5|13|And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things are in them, heard I saying,      Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, {be} the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.
Revelation|5|14|And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
