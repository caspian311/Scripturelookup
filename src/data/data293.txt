Jonah|4|8|And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|9|And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
Jonah|4|10|And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:
Jonah|4|11|and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
1 Samuel|1|1|Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
1 Samuel|1|2|and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1 Samuel|1|3|And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.
1 Samuel|1|4|And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
1 Samuel|1|5|but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|6|And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|7|And {as} he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1 Samuel|1|8|And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1 Samuel|1|9|So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|10|And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.
1 Samuel|1|11|And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
1 Samuel|1|12|And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
1 Samuel|1|13|Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1 Samuel|1|14|And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
1 Samuel|1|15|And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|16|Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.
1 Samuel|1|17|Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1 Samuel|1|18|And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more {sad}.
1 Samuel|1|19|And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
1 Samuel|1|20|And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, {saying}, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|21|And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1 Samuel|1|22|But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, {I will not go up} until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
1 Samuel|1|23|And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
1 Samuel|1|24|And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1 Samuel|1|25|And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel|1|26|And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|27|For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
1 Samuel|1|28|therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.
1 Samuel|2|1|And Hannah prayed, and said:             My heart exulteth in Jehovah;                   My horn is exalted in Jehovah;                   My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;                   Because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1 Samuel|2|2|There is none holy as Jehovah;                   For there is none besides thee,                   Neither is there any rock like our God.
1 Samuel|2|3|Talk no more so exceeding proudly;                   Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth;                   For Jehovah is a God of knowledge,                   And by him actions are weighed.
1 Samuel|2|4|The bows of the mighty men are broken;                   And they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1 Samuel|2|5|They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;                   And they that were hungry have ceased {to hunger}:                   Yea, the barren hath borne seven;                   And she that hath many children languisheth.
1 Samuel|2|6|Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive:                   He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.
1 Samuel|2|7|Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich:                   He bringeth low, he also lifteth up.
1 Samuel|2|8|He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,                   He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill,                   To make them sit with princes,                   And inherit the throne of glory:                   For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s,                   And he hath set the world upon them.
1 Samuel|2|9|He will keep the feet of his holy ones;                   But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;                   For by strength shall no man prevail.
1 Samuel|2|10|They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces;                   Against them will he thunder in heaven:                   Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth;                   And he will give strength unto his king,                   And exalt the horn of his anointed.
1 Samuel|2|11|And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel|2|12|Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|13|And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
1 Samuel|2|14|and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
1 Samuel|2|15|Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
1 Samuel|2|16|And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
1 Samuel|2|17|And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|18|But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
1 Samuel|2|19|Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel|2|20|And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.
1 Samuel|2|21|And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|22|Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
1 Samuel|2|23|And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
1 Samuel|2|24|Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.
1 Samuel|2|25|If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.
1 Samuel|2|26|And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.
1 Samuel|2|27|And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt {in bondage} to Pharaoh’s house?
1 Samuel|2|28|and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
1 Samuel|2|29|Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in {my} habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1 Samuel|2|30|Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
1 Samuel|2|31|Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
1 Samuel|2|32|And thou shalt behold the affliction of {my} habitation, in all the wealth which {God} shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
1 Samuel|2|33|And the man of thine, {whom} I shall not cut off from mine altar, {shall be} to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
1 Samuel|2|34|And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
1 Samuel|2|35|And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
1 Samuel|2|36|And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
1 Samuel|3|1|And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
1 Samuel|3|2|And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),
1 Samuel|3|3|and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep}, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
1 Samuel|3|4|that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|5|And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1 Samuel|3|6|And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
1 Samuel|3|7|Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.
1 Samuel|3|8|And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.
1 Samuel|3|9|Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
1 Samuel|3|10|And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
1 Samuel|3|11|And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
1 Samuel|3|12|In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.
1 Samuel|3|13|For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
1 Samuel|3|14|And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
1 Samuel|3|15|And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
1 Samuel|3|16|Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|17|And he said, What is the thing that {Jehovah} hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.
1 Samuel|3|18|And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.
1 Samuel|3|19|And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
1 Samuel|3|20|And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|3|21|And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|4|1|And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.      Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
1 Samuel|4|2|And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1 Samuel|4|3|And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
1 Samuel|4|4|So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth {above} the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Samuel|4|5|And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
1 Samuel|4|6|And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.
1 Samuel|4|7|And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
1 Samuel|4|8|Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel|4|9|Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1 Samuel|4|10|And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
1 Samuel|4|11|And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
