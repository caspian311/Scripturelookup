Job|29|11|For when the ear heard {me}, then it blessed me;                   And when the eye saw {me}, it gave witness unto me:
Job|29|12|Because I delivered the poor that cried,                   The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
Job|29|13|The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;                   And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job|29|14|I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:                   My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
Job|29|15|I was eyes to the blind,                   And feet was I to the lame.
Job|29|16|I was a father to the needy:                   And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
Job|29|17|And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous,                   And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
Job|29|18|Then I said, I shall die in my nest,                   And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
Job|29|19|My root is spread out to the waters,                   And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;
Job|29|20|My glory is fresh in me,                   And my bow is renewed in my hand.
Job|29|21|Unto me men gave ear, and waited,                   And kept silence for my counsel.
Job|29|22|After my words they spake not again;                   And my speech distilled upon them.
Job|29|23|And they waited for me as for the rain;                   And they opened their mouth wide {as} for the latter rain.
Job|29|24|I smiled on them, when they had no confidence;                   And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
Job|29|25|I chose out their way, and sat {as} chief,                   And dwelt as a king in the army,                   As one that comforteth the mourners.
Job|30|1|But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,                   Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
Job|30|2|Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?                   Men in whom ripe age is perished.
Job|30|3|They are gaunt with want and famine;                   They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
Job|30|4|They pluck salt-wort by the bushes;                    And the roots of the broom are their food.
Job|30|5|They are driven forth from the midst {of men};                   They cry after them as after a thief;
Job|30|6|So that they dwell in frightful valleys,                   In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Job|30|7|Among the bushes they bray;                   Under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job|30|8|{They are} children of fools, yea, children of base men;                   They were scourged out of the land.
Job|30|9|And now I am become their song,                   Yea, I am a byword unto them.
Job|30|10|They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,                   And spare not to spit in my face.
Job|30|11|For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me;                   And they have cast off the bridle before me.
Job|30|12|Upon my right hand rise the rabble;                   They thrust aside my feet,                   And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
Job|30|13|They mar my path,                   They set forward my calamity,                           {Even} men that have no helper.
Job|30|14|As through a wide breach they come:                   In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves {upon me}.
Job|30|15|Terrors are turned upon me;                   They chase mine honor as the wind;                   And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
Job|30|16|And now my soul is poured out within me;                   Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job|30|17|In the night season my bones are pierced in me,                   And the {pains} that gnaw me take no rest.
Job|30|18|By {God’s} great force is my garment disfigured;                   It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job|30|19|He hath cast me into the mire,                   And I am become like dust and ashes.
Job|30|20|I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me:                   I stand up, and thou gazest at me.
Job|30|21|Thou art turned to be cruel to me;                   With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.
Job|30|22|Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride {upon it};                    And thou dissolvest me in the storm.
Job|30|23|For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,                   And to the house appointed for all living.
Job|30|24|Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall?                   Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
Job|30|25|Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?                   Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job|30|26|When I looked for good, then evil came;                   And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
Job|30|27|My heart is troubled, and resteth not;                    Days of affliction are come upon me.
Job|30|28|I go mourning without the sun:                   I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
Job|30|29|I am a brother to jackals,                   And a companion to ostriches.
Job|30|30|My skin is black, {and falleth} from me,                   And my bones are burned with heat.
Job|30|31|Therefore is my harp {turned} to mourning,                   And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
Job|31|1|I made a covenant with mine eyes;                   How then should I look upon a virgin?
Job|31|2|For what is the portion from God above,                   And the heritage from the Almighty on high?
Job|31|3|Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,                   And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
Job|31|4|Doth not he see my ways,                   And number all my steps?
Job|31|5|If I have walked with falsehood,                   And my foot hath hasted to deceit
Job|31|6|(Let me be weighed in an even balance,                   That God may know mine integrity);
Job|31|7|If my step hath turned out of the way,                   And my heart walked after mine eyes,                   And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:
Job|31|8|Then let me sow, and let another eat;                   Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
Job|31|9|If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman,                   And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;
Job|31|10|Then let my wife grind unto another,                   And let others bow down upon her.
Job|31|11|For that were a heinous crime;                   Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
Job|31|12|For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction,                   And would root out all mine increase.
Job|31|13|If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant,                   When they contended with me;
Job|31|14|What then shall I do when God riseth up?                   And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Job|31|15|Did not he that made me in the womb make him?                   And did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job|31|16|If I have withheld the poor from {their} desire,                   Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
Job|31|17|Or have eaten my morsel alone,                   And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
Job|31|18|(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,                    And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);
Job|31|19|If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,                   Or that the needy had no covering;
Job|31|20|If his loins have not blessed me,                   And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
Job|31|21|If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,                   Because I saw my help in the gate:
Job|31|22|Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,                   And mine arm be broken from the bone.
Job|31|23|For calamity from God is a terror to me,                   And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.
Job|31|24|If I have made gold my hope,                   And have said to the fine gold, {Thou art} my confidence;
Job|31|25|If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,                   And because my hand had gotten much;
Job|31|26|If I have beheld the sun when it shined,                   Or the moon walking in brightness,
Job|31|27|And my heart hath been secretly enticed,                   And my mouth hath kissed my hand:
Job|31|28|This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges;                   For I should have denied the God that is above.
Job|31|29|If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,                   Or lifted up myself when evil found him;
Job|31|30|(Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin                   By asking his life with a curse);
Job|31|31|If the men of my tent have not said,                   Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?
Job|31|32|(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street;                   But I have opened my doors to the traveller);
Job|31|33|If like Adam I have covered my transgressions,                   By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,
Job|31|34|Because I feared the great multitude,                   And the contempt of families terrified me,                   So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door-
Job|31|35|Oh that I had one to hear me!                   (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me);                   And {that I had} the indictment which mine adversary hath written!
Job|31|36|Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;                   I would bind it unto me as a crown:
Job|31|37|I would declare unto him the number of my steps;                   As a prince would I go near unto him.
Job|31|38|If my land crieth out against me,                   And the furrows thereof weep together;
Job|31|39|If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,                   Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Job|31|40|Let thistles grow instead of wheat,                   And cockle instead of barley.                  The words of Job are ended.
Job|32|1|So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job|32|2|Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job|32|3|Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job|32|4|Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.
Job|32|5|And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
Job|32|6|And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,             I am young, and ye are very old;                   Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.
Job|32|7|I said, Days should speak,                   And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
Job|32|8|But there is a spirit in man,                   And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job|32|9|It is not the great that are wise,                   Nor the aged that understand justice.
Job|32|10|Therefore I said, Hearken to me;                   I also will show mine opinion.
Job|32|11|Behold, I waited for your words,                   I listened for your reasonings,                   Whilst ye searched out what to say.
Job|32|12|Yea, I attended unto you,                   And, behold, there was none that convinced Job,                   Or that answered his words, among you.
Job|32|13|Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom;                   God may vanquish him, not man:
Job|32|14|For he hath not directed his words against me;                   Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
