1 Thessalonians|3|9|For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
1 Thessalonians|3|10|night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians|3|11|Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:
1 Thessalonians|3|12|and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also {do} toward you;
1 Thessalonians|3|13|to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
1 Thessalonians|4|1|Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk, --that ye abound more and more.
1 Thessalonians|4|2|For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians|4|3|For this is the will of God, {even} your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;
1 Thessalonians|4|4|that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
1 Thessalonians|4|5|not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;
1 Thessalonians|4|6|that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
1 Thessalonians|4|7|For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
1 Thessalonians|4|8|Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.
1 Thessalonians|4|9|But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
1 Thessalonians|4|10|for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;
1 Thessalonians|4|11|and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;
1 Thessalonians|4|12|that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
1 Thessalonians|4|13|But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians|4|14|For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
1 Thessalonians|4|15|For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians|4|16|For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
1 Thessalonians|4|17|then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians|4|18|Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians|5|1|But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.
1 Thessalonians|5|2|For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|3|When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.
1 Thessalonians|5|4|But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
1 Thessalonians|5|5|for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
1 Thessalonians|5|6|so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
1 Thessalonians|5|7|For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|8|But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians|5|9|For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians|5|10|who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1 Thessalonians|5|11|Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.
1 Thessalonians|5|12|But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
1 Thessalonians|5|13|and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians|5|14|And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|15|See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|16|Rejoice always;
1 Thessalonians|5|17|pray without ceasing;
1 Thessalonians|5|18|in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.
1 Thessalonians|5|19|Quench not the Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|5|20|despise not prophesyings;
1 Thessalonians|5|21|prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
1 Thessalonians|5|22|abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians|5|23|And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians|5|24|Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.
1 Thessalonians|5|25|Brethren, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians|5|26|Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians|5|27|I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians|5|28|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Romans|1|1|Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called {to be} an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Romans|1|2|which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
Romans|1|3|concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans|1|4|who was declared {to be} the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead; {even} Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans|1|5|through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake;
Romans|1|6|among whom are ye also called {to be} Jesus Christ’s:
Romans|1|7|To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called {to be} saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|1|8|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
Romans|1|9|For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers
Romans|1|10|making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you.
Romans|1|11|For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
Romans|1|12|that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
Romans|1|13|And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans|1|14|I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans|1|15|So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.
Romans|1|16|For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
Romans|1|17|For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.
Romans|1|18|For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;
Romans|1|19|because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them.
Romans|1|20|For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, {even} his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:
Romans|1|21|because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
Romans|1|22|Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
Romans|1|23|and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
Romans|1|24|Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves:
Romans|1|25|for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|1|26|For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:
Romans|1|27|and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.
Romans|1|28|And even as they refused to have God in {their} knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
Romans|1|29|being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
Romans|1|30|backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Romans|1|31|without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:
Romans|1|32|who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.
Romans|2|1|Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.
Romans|2|2|And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.
Romans|2|3|And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
Romans|2|4|Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
Romans|2|5|but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
Romans|2|6|who will render to every man according to his works:
Romans|2|7|to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:
Romans|2|8|but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, {shall be} wrath and indignation,
Romans|2|9|tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
Romans|2|10|but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:
Romans|2|11|for there is no respect of persons with God.
Romans|2|12|For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
Romans|2|13|for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
Romans|2|14|(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;
Romans|2|15|in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing {them});
Romans|2|16|in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.
Romans|2|17|But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,
