2 Chronicles|33|13|And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.
2 Chronicles|33|14|Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about {with it}, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles|33|15|And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
2 Chronicles|33|16|And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|17|Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.
2 Chronicles|33|18|Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|19|His prayer also, and how {God} was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
2 Chronicles|33|20|So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|33|21|Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|22|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|23|And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
2 Chronicles|33|24|And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
2 Chronicles|33|25|But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Chronicles|34|1|Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Chronicles|34|3|For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.
2 Chronicles|34|4|And they brake down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the sun-images that were on high above them he hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves {of them} that had sacrificed unto them.
2 Chronicles|34|5|And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|6|And {so did he} in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
2 Chronicles|34|7|And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|8|Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|34|9|And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|10|And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;
2 Chronicles|34|11|even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2 Chronicles|34|12|And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and {others of} the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.
2 Chronicles|34|13|Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2 Chronicles|34|14|And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah {given} by Moses.
2 Chronicles|34|15|And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
2 Chronicles|34|16|And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.
2 Chronicles|34|17|And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
2 Chronicles|34|18|And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.
2 Chronicles|34|19|And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2 Chronicles|34|20|And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the kingâ€™s servant, saying,
2 Chronicles|34|21|Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|22|So Hilkiah, and they whom the king {had commanded}, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.
2 Chronicles|34|23|And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,
2 Chronicles|34|24|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|34|25|Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
2 Chronicles|34|26|But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,
2 Chronicles|34|27|because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|28|Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.
2 Chronicles|34|29|Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|30|And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|31|And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|32|And he caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand {to it}. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|34|33|And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from following Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|35|1|And Josiah kept a passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
2 Chronicles|35|2|And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|35|3|And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|35|4|And prepare yourselves after your fathersâ€™ houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
2 Chronicles|35|5|And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathersâ€™ houses of your brethren the children of the people, and {let there be for each} a portion of a fathersâ€™ house of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|35|6|And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.
2 Chronicles|35|7|And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the kingâ€™s substance.
2 Chronicles|35|8|And his princes gave for a freewill-offering unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred {small cattle}, and three hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|9|Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand {small cattle}, and five hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|10|So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the kingâ€™s commandment.
2 Chronicles|35|11|And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled {the blood which they received} of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
2 Chronicles|35|12|And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathersâ€™ houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|13|And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
2 Chronicles|35|14|And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron {were busied} in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles|35|15|And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2 Chronicles|35|16|So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|17|And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
2 Chronicles|35|18|And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|35|19|In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
2 Chronicles|35|20|After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
2 Chronicles|35|21|But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? {I come} not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war; and God hath commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from {meddling with} God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
2 Chronicles|35|22|Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles|35|23|And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
2 Chronicles|35|24|So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|25|And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
2 Chronicles|35|26|Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|35|27|and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles|36|1|Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|2|Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|3|And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2 Chronicles|36|4|And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles|36|5|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|36|6|Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|7|Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|8|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|36|9|Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|10|And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|11|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
2 Chronicles|36|12|and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God; he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet {speaking} from the mouth of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|13|And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|36|14|Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|15|And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
2 Chronicles|36|16|but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
2 Chronicles|36|17|Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
2 Chronicles|36|18|And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|19|And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|36|20|And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
2 Chronicles|36|21|to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: {for} as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
2 Chronicles|36|22|Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
2 Chronicles|36|23|Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.
