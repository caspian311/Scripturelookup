Hebrews|11|33|who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews|11|34|quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.
Hebrews|11|35|Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
Hebrews|11|36|and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
Hebrews|11|37|they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
Hebrews|11|38|(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.
Hebrews|11|39|And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,
Hebrews|11|40|God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
Hebrews|12|1|Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
Hebrews|12|2|looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of {our} faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews|12|3|For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.
Hebrews|12|4|Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:
Hebrews|12|5|and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons,             My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord,                   Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;
Hebrews|12|6|For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,                   And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
Hebrews|12|7|It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom {his} father chasteneth not?
Hebrews|12|8|But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Hebrews|12|9|Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
Hebrews|12|10|For they indeed for a few days chastened {us} as seemed good to them; but he for {our} profit, that {we} may be partakers of his holiness.
Hebrews|12|11|All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, {even the fruit} of righteousness.
Hebrews|12|12|Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;
Hebrews|12|13|and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
Hebrews|12|14|Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:
Hebrews|12|15|looking carefully lest {there be} any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble {you}, and thereby the many be defiled;
Hebrews|12|16|lest {there be} any fornication, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.
Hebrews|12|17|For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind {in his father,} though he sought it diligently with tears.
Hebrews|12|18|For ye are not come unto {a mount} that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
Hebrews|12|19|and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which {voice} they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;
Hebrews|12|20|for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
Hebrews|12|21|and so fearful was the appearance, {that} Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:
Hebrews|12|22|but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
Hebrews|12|23|to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
Hebrews|12|24|and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than {that of} Abel.
Hebrews|12|25|See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned {them} on earth, much more {shall not} we {escape} who turn away from him that {warneth} from heaven:
Hebrews|12|26|whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.
Hebrews|12|27|And this {word}, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
Hebrews|12|28|Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:
Hebrews|12|29|for our God is a consuming fire.
Hebrews|13|1|Let love of the brethren continue.
Hebrews|13|2|Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
Hebrews|13|3|Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body.
Hebrews|13|4|{Let} marriage {be} had in honor among all, and {let} the bed {be} undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews|13|5|Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.
Hebrews|13|6|So that with good courage we say,             The Lord is my helper; I will not fear:                   What shall man do unto me?
Hebrews|13|7|Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.
Hebrews|13|8|Jesus Christ {is} the same yesterday and to-day, {yea} and for ever.
Hebrews|13|9|Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.
Hebrews|13|10|We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.
Hebrews|13|11|For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest {as an offering} for sin, are burned without the camp.
Hebrews|13|12|Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.
Hebrews|13|13|Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
Hebrews|13|14|For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after {the city} which is to come.
Hebrews|13|15|Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.
Hebrews|13|16|But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews|13|17|Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit {to them}: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this {were} unprofitable for you.
Hebrews|13|18|Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
Hebrews|13|19|And I exhort {you} the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews|13|20|Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, {even} our Lord Jesus,
Hebrews|13|21|make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom {be} the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews|13|22|But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words.
Hebrews|13|23|Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
Hebrews|13|24|Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
Hebrews|13|25|Grace be with you all. Amen.
1 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
1 Thessalonians|1|2|We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention {of you} in our prayers;
1 Thessalonians|1|3|remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
1 Thessalonians|1|4|knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,
1 Thessalonians|1|5|how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and {in} much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.
1 Thessalonians|1|6|And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|1|7|so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians|1|8|For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.
1 Thessalonians|1|9|For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
1 Thessalonians|1|10|and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, {even} Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
1 Thessalonians|2|1|For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:
1 Thessalonians|2|2|but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.
1 Thessalonians|2|3|For our exhortation {is} not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
1 Thessalonians|2|4|but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.
1 Thessalonians|2|5|For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;
1 Thessalonians|2|6|nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians|2|7|But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:
1 Thessalonians|2|8|even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.
1 Thessalonians|2|9|For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
1 Thessalonians|2|10|Ye are witnesses, and God {also}, how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:
1 Thessalonians|2|11|as ye know how we {dealt with} each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging {you}, and testifying,
1 Thessalonians|2|12|to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians|2|13|And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, {even the word} of God, ye accepted {it} not {as} the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.
1 Thessalonians|2|14|For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;
1 Thessalonians|2|15|who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all men;
1 Thessalonians|2|16|forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1 Thessalonians|2|17|But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:
1 Thessalonians|2|18|because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.
1 Thessalonians|2|19|For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
1 Thessalonians|2|20|For ye are our glory and our joy.
1 Thessalonians|3|1|Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;
1 Thessalonians|3|2|and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort {you} concerning your faith;
1 Thessalonians|3|3|that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.
1 Thessalonians|3|4|For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
1 Thessalonians|3|5|For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
1 Thessalonians|3|6|But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also {to see} you;
1 Thessalonians|3|7|for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:
1 Thessalonians|3|8|for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
