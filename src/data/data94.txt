Zechariah|7|11|But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.
Zechariah|7|12|Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|7|13|And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;
Zechariah|7|14|but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
Zechariah|8|1|And the word of Jehovah of hosts came {to me}, saying,
Zechariah|8|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
Zechariah|8|3|Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.
Zechariah|8|4|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
Zechariah|8|5|And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
Zechariah|8|6|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
Zechariah|8|8|and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
Zechariah|8|9|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.
Zechariah|8|10|For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
Zechariah|8|11|But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|12|For {there shall be} the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
Zechariah|8|13|And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear not, {but} let your hands be strong.
Zechariah|8|14|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;
Zechariah|8|15|so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
Zechariah|8|16|These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;
Zechariah|8|17|and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|18|And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|8|19|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth {month}, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.
Zechariah|8|20|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: {It shall} yet {come to pass}, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;
Zechariah|8|21|and the inhabitants of one {city} shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.
Zechariah|8|22|Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|23|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days {it shall come to pass}, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.
Zechariah|9|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah upon the land of Hadrach, and Damascus {shall be} its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah);
Zechariah|9|2|and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
Zechariah|9|3|And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
Zechariah|9|4|Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
Zechariah|9|5|Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
Zechariah|9|6|And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah|9|7|And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
Zechariah|9|8|And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
Zechariah|9|9|Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
Zechariah|9|10|And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah|9|11|As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.
Zechariah|9|12|Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.
Zechariah|9|13|For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
Zechariah|9|14|And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
Zechariah|9|15|Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.
Zechariah|9|16|And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people; for {they shall be as} the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.
Zechariah|9|17|For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
Zechariah|10|1|Ask ye of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain, {even of} Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
Zechariah|10|2|For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
Zechariah|10|3|Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.
Zechariah|10|4|From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
Zechariah|10|5|And they shall be as mighty men, treading down {their enemies} in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
Zechariah|10|6|And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.
Zechariah|10|7|And {they of} Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.
Zechariah|10|8|I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.
Zechariah|10|9|And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
Zechariah|10|10|I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and {place} shall not be found for them.
Zechariah|10|11|And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
Zechariah|10|12|And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|1|Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
Zechariah|11|2|Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.
Zechariah|11|3|A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.
Zechariah|11|4|Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
Zechariah|11|5|whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.
Zechariah|11|6|For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
Zechariah|11|7|So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
Zechariah|11|8|And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
Zechariah|11|9|Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.
Zechariah|11|10|And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
Zechariah|11|11|And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|12|And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty {pieces} of silver.
Zechariah|11|13|And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty {pieces} of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|14|Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah|11|15|And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah|11|16|For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat {sheep}, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.
Zechariah|11|17|Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
Zechariah|12|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. {Thus} saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:
Zechariah|12|2|behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|3|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
Zechariah|12|4|In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.
Zechariah|12|5|And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.
Zechariah|12|6|In that day will I make the chieftains of Judah like a pan of fire among wood, and like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and {they of} Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|7|Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.
Zechariah|12|8|In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.
Zechariah|12|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|10|And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
Zechariah|12|11|In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
Zechariah|12|12|And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|13|the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|14|all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
Zechariah|13|1|In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
Zechariah|13|2|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
Zechariah|13|3|And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
Zechariah|13|4|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
Zechariah|13|5|but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
Zechariah|13|6|And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
Zechariah|13|7|Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
Zechariah|13|8|And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
Zechariah|13|9|And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.
Zechariah|14|1|Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
Zechariah|14|2|For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah|14|3|Then shall Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
Zechariah|14|4|And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall be cleft in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, {and there shall be} a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
