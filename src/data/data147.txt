John|11|38|Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
John|11|39|Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been {dead} four days.
John|11|40|Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
John|11|41|So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.
John|11|42|And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.
John|11|43|And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
John|11|44|He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
John|11|45|Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.
John|11|46|But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
John|11|47|The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.
John|11|48|If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
John|11|49|But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
John|11|50|nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
John|11|51|Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
John|11|52|and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.
John|11|53|So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
John|11|54|Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.
John|11|55|Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.
John|11|56|They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?
John|11|57|Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.
John|12|1|Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
John|12|2|So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
John|12|3|Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
John|12|4|But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,
John|12|5|Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?
John|12|6|Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.
John|12|7|Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.
John|12|8|For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
John|12|9|The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John|12|10|But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
John|12|11|because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
John|12|12|On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John|12|13|took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.
John|12|14|And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
John|12|15|Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
John|12|16|These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
John|12|17|The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
John|12|18|For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.
John|12|19|The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.
John|12|20|Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:
John|12|21|these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
John|12|22|Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.
John|12|23|And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
John|12|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
John|12|25|He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
John|12|26|If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.
John|12|27|Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.
John|12|28|Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, {saying}, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
John|12|29|The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
John|12|30|Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
John|12|31|Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
John|12|32|And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.
John|12|33|But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|12|34|The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
John|12|35|Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
John|12|36|While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
John|12|37|But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:
John|12|38|that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,             Lord, who hath believed our report?                   And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
John|12|39|For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
John|12|40|He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;                   Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,                   And should turn,                   And I should heal them.
John|12|41|These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.
John|12|42|Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess {it}, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
John|12|43|for they loved the glory {that is} of men more than the glory {that is} of God.
John|12|44|And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
John|12|45|And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.
John|12|46|I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.
John|12|47|And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John|12|48|He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.
John|12|49|For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
John|12|50|And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.
John|13|1|Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
John|13|2|And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s {son}, to betray him,
John|13|3|{Jesus}, knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,
John|13|4|riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.
John|13|5|Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
John|13|6|So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John|13|7|Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.
John|13|8|Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
John|13|9|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
John|13|10|Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
John|13|11|For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
John|13|12|So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
John|13|13|Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
John|13|14|If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John|13|15|For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.
John|13|16|Verily, verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.
John|13|17|If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.
John|13|18|I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.
John|13|19|From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am {he}.
John|13|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
John|13|21|When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
John|13|22|The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
John|13|23|There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John|13|24|Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him, and saith unto him, Tell {us} who it is of whom he speaketh.
John|13|25|He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
John|13|26|Jesus therefore answereth, He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he taketh and giveth it to Judas, {the son} of Simon Iscariot.
John|13|27|And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.
John|13|28|Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
John|13|29|For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John|13|30|He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
