1 Samuel|22|22|And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned {the death} of all the persons of thy father’s house.
1 Samuel|22|23|Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
1 Samuel|23|1|And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.
1 Samuel|23|2|Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|3|And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1 Samuel|23|4|Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
1 Samuel|23|5|And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|6|And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1 Samuel|23|7|And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
1 Samuel|23|8|And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1 Samuel|23|9|And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
1 Samuel|23|10|Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
1 Samuel|23|11|Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
1 Samuel|23|12|Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.
1 Samuel|23|13|Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
1 Samuel|23|14|And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
1 Samuel|23|15|And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
1 Samuel|23|16|And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
1 Samuel|23|17|And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
1 Samuel|23|18|And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
1 Samuel|23|19|Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
1 Samuel|23|20|Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.
1 Samuel|23|21|And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.
1 Samuel|23|22|Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, {and} who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.
1 Samuel|23|23|See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
1 Samuel|23|24|And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
1 Samuel|23|25|And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard {that}, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1 Samuel|23|26|And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
1 Samuel|23|27|But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.
1 Samuel|23|28|So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
1 Samuel|23|29|And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1 Samuel|24|1|And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
1 Samuel|24|2|Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1 Samuel|24|3|And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
1 Samuel|24|4|And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
1 Samuel|24|5|And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
1 Samuel|24|6|And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|7|So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
1 Samuel|24|8|David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
1 Samuel|24|9|And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
1 Samuel|24|10|Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but {mine eye} spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|11|Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.
1 Samuel|24|12|Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|13|As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|14|After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
1 Samuel|24|15|Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
1 Samuel|24|16|And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|24|17|And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.
1 Samuel|24|18|And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.
1 Samuel|24|19|For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.
1 Samuel|24|20|And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
1 Samuel|24|21|Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.
1 Samuel|24|22|And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.
1 Samuel|25|1|And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1 Samuel|25|2|And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|3|Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
1 Samuel|25|4|And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel|25|5|And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
1 Samuel|25|6|and thus shall ye say to him that liveth {in prosperity}, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
1 Samuel|25|7|And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|8|Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
1 Samuel|25|9|And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
1 Samuel|25|10|And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.
1 Samuel|25|11|Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?
1 Samuel|25|12|So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
1 Samuel|25|13|And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
1 Samuel|25|14|But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
1 Samuel|25|15|But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:
1 Samuel|25|16|they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
1 Samuel|25|17|Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.
1 Samuel|25|18|Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
1 Samuel|25|19|And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|20|And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
1 Samuel|25|21|Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.
1 Samuel|25|22|God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.
1 Samuel|25|23|And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
1 Samuel|25|24|And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.
1 Samuel|25|25|Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
1 Samuel|25|26|Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|27|And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
1 Samuel|25|28|Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.
1 Samuel|25|29|And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
1 Samuel|25|30|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,
1 Samuel|25|31|that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
1 Samuel|25|32|And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:
1 Samuel|25|33|and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
1 Samuel|25|34|For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.
1 Samuel|25|35|So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
1 Samuel|25|36|And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1 Samuel|25|37|And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1 Samuel|25|38|And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.
1 Samuel|25|39|And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|40|And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|41|And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1 Samuel|25|42|And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1 Samuel|25|43|David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.
1 Samuel|25|44|Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1 Samuel|26|1|And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
1 Samuel|26|2|Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1 Samuel|26|3|And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
