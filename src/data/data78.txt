2 Chronicles|29|30|Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
2 Chronicles|29|31|Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto Jehovah; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart {brought} burnt-offerings.
2 Chronicles|29|32|And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|33|And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles|29|34|But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
2 Chronicles|29|35|And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
2 Chronicles|29|36|And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
2 Chronicles|30|1|And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|30|2|For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles|30|3|For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|4|And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|5|So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
2 Chronicles|30|6|So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
2 Chronicles|30|7|And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
2 Chronicles|30|8|Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
2 Chronicles|30|9|For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
2 Chronicles|30|10|So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
2 Chronicles|30|11|Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|12|Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|13|And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|14|And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|30|15|Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|16|And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood {which they received} of the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|30|17|For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|18|For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one
2 Chronicles|30|19|that setteth his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though {he be} not {cleansed} according to the purification of the sanctuary.
2 Chronicles|30|20|And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2 Chronicles|30|21|And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, {singing} with loud instruments unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|22|And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding {in the service} of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|30|23|And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept {other} seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles|30|24|For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2 Chronicles|30|25|And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
2 Chronicles|30|26|So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|27|Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.
2 Chronicles|31|1|Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2 Chronicles|31|2|And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|3|{He appointed} also the kingâ€™s portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, {to wit}, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|4|Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|5|And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
2 Chronicles|31|6|And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|7|In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|31|8|And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|31|9|Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|10|And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since {the people} began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
2 Chronicles|31|11|Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them.
2 Chronicles|31|12|And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.
2 Chronicles|31|13|And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|31|14|And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east {gate}, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
2 Chronicles|31|15|And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
2 Chronicles|31|16|besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|17|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathersâ€™ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|18|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.
2 Chronicles|31|19|Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
2 Chronicles|31|20|And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|31|21|And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
2 Chronicles|32|1|After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
2 Chronicles|32|2|And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles|32|3|he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.
2 Chronicles|32|4|So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
2 Chronicles|32|5|And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised {it} up to the towers, and the other wall without, and strengthened Millo {in} the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
2 Chronicles|32|6|And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|7|Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:
2 Chronicles|32|8|with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|32|9|After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|10|Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?
2 Chronicles|32|11|Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Chronicles|32|12|Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?
2 Chronicles|32|13|Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|14|Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|15|Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|16|And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|17|He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
2 Chronicles|32|18|And they cried with a loud voice in the Jewsâ€™ language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
2 Chronicles|32|19|And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of menâ€™s hands.
2 Chronicles|32|20|And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
2 Chronicles|32|21|And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
2 Chronicles|32|22|Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all {others}, and guided them on every side.
2 Chronicles|32|23|And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
2 Chronicles|32|24|In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.
2 Chronicles|32|25|But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|32|26|Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|27|And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;
2 Chronicles|32|28|store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.
2 Chronicles|32|29|Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.
2 Chronicles|32|30|This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2 Chronicles|32|31|Howbeit in {the business of} the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2 Chronicles|32|32|Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|32|33|And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|33|1|Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|3|For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|4|And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
2 Chronicles|33|5|And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|33|6|He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Chronicles|33|7|And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
2 Chronicles|33|8|neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances {given} by Moses.
2 Chronicles|33|9|And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|10|And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.
2 Chronicles|33|11|Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|33|12|And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
