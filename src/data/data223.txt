2 Timothy|4|22|The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
Ephesians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|1|3|Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly {places} in Christ:
Ephesians|1|4|even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:
Ephesians|1|5|having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Ephesians|1|6|to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:
Ephesians|1|7|in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
Ephesians|1|8|which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
Ephesians|1|9|making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
Ephesians|1|10|unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, {I say,}
Ephesians|1|11|in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;
Ephesians|1|12|to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
Ephesians|1|13|in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,-- in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians|1|14|which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of {Godâ€™s} own possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Ephesians|1|15|For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which {ye show} toward all the saints,
Ephesians|1|16|cease not to give thanks for you, making mention {of you} in my prayers;
Ephesians|1|17|that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
Ephesians|1|18|having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians|1|19|and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
Ephesians|1|20|which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly {places},
Ephesians|1|21|far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
Ephesians|1|22|and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,
Ephesians|1|23|which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
Ephesians|2|1|And you {did he make alive,} when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,
Ephesians|2|2|wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;
Ephesians|2|3|among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--
Ephesians|2|4|but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Ephesians|2|5|even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),
Ephesians|2|6|and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly {places}, in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|7|that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|8|for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, {it is} the gift of God;
Ephesians|2|9|not of works, that no man should glory.
Ephesians|2|10|For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.
Ephesians|2|11|Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;
Ephesians|2|12|that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians|2|13|But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.
Ephesians|2|14|For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,
Ephesians|2|15|having abolished in the flesh the enmity, {even} the law of commandments {contained} in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, {so} making peace;
Ephesians|2|16|and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
Ephesians|2|17|and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:
Ephesians|2|18|for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians|2|19|So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
Ephesians|2|20|being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;
Ephesians|2|21|in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;
Ephesians|2|22|in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.
Ephesians|3|1|For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,--
Ephesians|3|2|if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;
Ephesians|3|3|how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,
Ephesians|3|4|whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
Ephesians|3|5|which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
Ephesians|3|6|{to wit}, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
Ephesians|3|7|whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
Ephesians|3|8|Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
Ephesians|3|9|and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;
Ephesians|3|10|to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly {places} might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
Ephesians|3|11|according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians|3|12|in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
Ephesians|3|13|Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
Ephesians|3|14|For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
Ephesians|3|15|from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians|3|16|that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
Ephesians|3|17|that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians|3|18|may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
Ephesians|3|19|and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
Ephesians|3|20|Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Ephesians|3|21|unto him {be} the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians|4|1|I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
Ephesians|4|2|with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Ephesians|4|3|giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians|4|4|{There is} one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians|4|5|one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians|4|6|one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
Ephesians|4|7|But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians|4|8|Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.
Ephesians|4|9|(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians|4|10|He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
Ephesians|4|11|And he gave some {to be} apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
Ephesians|4|12|for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:
Ephesians|4|13|till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
Ephesians|4|14|that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
Ephesians|4|15|but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, {even} Christ;
Ephesians|4|16|from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in {due} measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.
Ephesians|4|17|This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,
Ephesians|4|18|being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;
Ephesians|4|19|who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
Ephesians|4|20|But ye did not so learn Christ;
Ephesians|4|21|if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
Ephesians|4|22|that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
Ephesians|4|23|and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
Ephesians|4|24|and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
Ephesians|4|25|Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
Ephesians|4|26|Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
Ephesians|4|27|neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians|4|28|Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.
Ephesians|4|29|Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.
Ephesians|4|30|And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.
Ephesians|4|31|Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:
Ephesians|4|32|and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.
Ephesians|5|1|Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
