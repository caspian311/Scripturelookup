Jeremiah|11|20|But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Jeremiah|11|21|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;
Jeremiah|11|22|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
Jeremiah|11|23|and there shall be no remnant unto them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
Jeremiah|12|1|Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?
Jeremiah|12|2|Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
Jeremiah|12|3|But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
Jeremiah|12|4|How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
Jeremiah|12|5|If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?
Jeremiah|12|6|For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
Jeremiah|12|7|I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
Jeremiah|12|8|My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.
Jeremiah|12|9|Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
Jeremiah|12|10|Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah|12|11|They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
Jeremiah|12|12|Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.
Jeremiah|12|13|They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|12|14|Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah|12|15|And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
Jeremiah|12|16|And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.
Jeremiah|12|17|But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|13|1|Thus saith Jehovah unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
Jeremiah|13|2|So I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.
Jeremiah|13|3|And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,
Jeremiah|13|4|Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
Jeremiah|13|5|So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
Jeremiah|13|6|And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
Jeremiah|13|7|Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|8|Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|13|9|Thus saith Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|13|10|This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|11|For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
Jeremiah|13|12|Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
Jeremiah|13|13|Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
Jeremiah|13|14|And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
Jeremiah|13|15|Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken.
Jeremiah|13|16|Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
Jeremiah|13|17|But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for {your} pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.
Jeremiah|13|18|Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.
Jeremiah|13|19|The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.
Jeremiah|13|20|Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
Jeremiah|13|21|What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?
Jeremiah|13|22|And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.
Jeremiah|13|23|Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
Jeremiah|13|24|Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.
Jeremiah|13|25|This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
Jeremiah|13|26|Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.
Jeremiah|13|27|I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
Jeremiah|14|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
Jeremiah|14|2|Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
Jeremiah|14|3|And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|4|Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|5|Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh {her young}, because there is no grass.
Jeremiah|14|6|And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
Jeremiah|14|7|Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|8|O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
Jeremiah|14|9|Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
Jeremiah|14|10|Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
Jeremiah|14|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for {their} good.
Jeremiah|14|12|When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Jeremiah|14|13|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
Jeremiah|14|14|Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.
Jeremiah|14|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
Jeremiah|14|16|And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
Jeremiah|14|17|And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
Jeremiah|14|18|If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
Jeremiah|14|19|Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
Jeremiah|14|20|We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|21|Do not abhor {us}, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
Jeremiah|14|22|Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O Jehovah our God? therefore we will wait for thee; for thou hast made all these things.
Jeremiah|15|1|Then said Jehovah unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
Jeremiah|15|2|And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
Jeremiah|15|3|And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
Jeremiah|15|4|And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|15|5|For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?
Jeremiah|15|6|Thou hast rejected me, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.
Jeremiah|15|7|And I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved {them} of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.
Jeremiah|15|8|Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
Jeremiah|15|9|She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|10|Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; {yet} every one of them doth curse me.
Jeremiah|15|11|Jehovah said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
Jeremiah|15|12|Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
Jeremiah|15|13|Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
Jeremiah|15|14|And I will make {them} to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
Jeremiah|15|15|O Jehovah, thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
Jeremiah|15|16|Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.
Jeremiah|15|17|I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.
Jeremiah|15|18|Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful {brook}, as waters that fail?
Jeremiah|15|19|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.
Jeremiah|15|20|And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|21|And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
Jeremiah|16|1|The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|16|2|Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place.
Jeremiah|16|3|For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:
Jeremiah|16|4|They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|16|5|For thus saith Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.
Jeremiah|16|6|Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
Jeremiah|16|7|neither shall men break {bread} for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
Jeremiah|16|8|And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
Jeremiah|16|9|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
