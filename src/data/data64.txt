Isaiah|33|11|Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
Isaiah|33|12|And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
Isaiah|33|13|Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
Isaiah|33|14|The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?
Isaiah|33|15|He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:
Isaiah|33|16|He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given {him}; his waters shall be sure.
Isaiah|33|17|Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.
Isaiah|33|18|Thy heart shall muse on the terror: Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed {the tribute}? where is he that counted the towers?
Isaiah|33|19|Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.
Isaiah|33|20|Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
Isaiah|33|21|But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
Isaiah|33|22|For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.
Isaiah|33|23|Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.
Isaiah|33|24|And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
Isaiah|34|1|Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.
Isaiah|34|2|For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
Isaiah|34|3|Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
Isaiah|34|4|And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading {leaf} from the fig-tree.
Isaiah|34|5|For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
Isaiah|34|6|The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
Isaiah|34|7|And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
Isaiah|34|8|For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
Isaiah|34|9|And the streams of {Edom} shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
Isaiah|34|10|It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
Isaiah|34|11|But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
Isaiah|34|12|They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.
Isaiah|34|13|And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.
Isaiah|34|14|And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.
Isaiah|34|15|There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.
Isaiah|34|16|Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.
Isaiah|34|17|And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
Isaiah|35|1|The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
Isaiah|35|2|It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
Isaiah|35|3|Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Isaiah|35|4|Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come {with} vengeance, {with} the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
Isaiah|35|5|Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Isaiah|35|6|Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
Isaiah|35|7|And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
Isaiah|35|8|And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for {the redeemed}: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err {therein}.
Isaiah|35|9|No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk {there}:
Isaiah|35|10|and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
Isaiah|36|1|Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
Isaiah|36|2|And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
Isaiah|36|3|Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
Isaiah|36|4|And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
Isaiah|36|5|I say, {thy} counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
Isaiah|36|6|Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
Isaiah|36|7|But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
Isaiah|36|8|Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
Isaiah|36|9|How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah|36|10|And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Isaiah|36|11|Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
Isaiah|36|12|But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
Isaiah|36|13|Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|14|Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:
Isaiah|36|15|neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|16|Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Isaiah|36|17|until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah|36|18|Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isaiah|36|19|Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|20|Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|21|But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Isaiah|36|22|Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Isaiah|37|1|And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|2|And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
Isaiah|37|3|And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
Isaiah|37|4|It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
Isaiah|37|5|So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah|37|6|And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Isaiah|37|7|Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
Isaiah|37|8|So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
Isaiah|37|9|And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isaiah|37|10|Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|37|11|Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
Isaiah|37|12|Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
Isaiah|37|13|Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
Isaiah|37|14|And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|15|And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
Isaiah|37|16|O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest {above} the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
Isaiah|37|17|Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.
Isaiah|37|18|Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
Isaiah|37|19|and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
Isaiah|37|20|Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.
Isaiah|37|21|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Isaiah|37|22|this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
Isaiah|37|23|Whom hast thou defied and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? {even} against the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|37|24|By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;
Isaiah|37|25|I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
Isaiah|37|26|Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
Isaiah|37|27|Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field {of grain} before it is grown up.
Isaiah|37|28|But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
Isaiah|37|29|Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
Isaiah|37|30|And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
Isaiah|37|31|And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah|37|32|For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah|37|33|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
Isaiah|37|34|By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|35|For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
Isaiah|37|36|And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
Isaiah|37|37|So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
