Ezekiel|1|21|When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel|1|22|And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.
Ezekiel|1|23|And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|24|And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|25|And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|26|And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.
Ezekiel|1|27|And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
Ezekiel|1|28|As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
Ezekiel|2|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
Ezekiel|2|2|And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.
Ezekiel|2|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.
Ezekiel|2|4|And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|2|5|And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
Ezekiel|2|6|And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|2|7|And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
Ezekiel|2|8|But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
Ezekiel|2|9|And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
Ezekiel|2|10|And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
Ezekiel|3|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|3|2|So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.
Ezekiel|3|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
Ezekiel|3|4|And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
Ezekiel|3|5|For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel|3|6|not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.
Ezekiel|3|7|But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
Ezekiel|3|8|Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
Ezekiel|3|9|As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|10|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
Ezekiel|3|11|And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
Ezekiel|3|12|Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, {saying}, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
Ezekiel|3|13|And {I heard} the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
Ezekiel|3|14|So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
Ezekiel|3|15|Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
Ezekiel|3|16|And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|3|17|Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
Ezekiel|3|18|When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|19|Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|20|Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|21|Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|22|And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
Ezekiel|3|23|Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel|3|24|Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
Ezekiel|3|25|But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
Ezekiel|3|26|and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|27|But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|4|1|Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:
Ezekiel|4|2|and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.
Ezekiel|4|3|And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|4|Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; {according to} the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|4|5|For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|6|And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.
Ezekiel|4|7|And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.
Ezekiel|4|8|And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.
Ezekiel|4|9|Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; {according to} the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.
Ezekiel|4|10|And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
Ezekiel|4|11|And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
Ezekiel|4|12|And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.
Ezekiel|4|13|And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.
Ezekiel|4|14|Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
Ezekiel|4|15|Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.
Ezekiel|4|16|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:
Ezekiel|4|17|that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
Ezekiel|5|1|And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword; {as} a barber’s razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
Ezekiel|5|2|A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|3|And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
Ezekiel|5|4|And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|5|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.
Ezekiel|5|6|And she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected mine ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
Ezekiel|5|7|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;
Ezekiel|5|8|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|5|9|And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|5|10|Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.
Ezekiel|5|11|Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish {thee}; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.
Ezekiel|5|12|A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|13|Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|5|14|Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
Ezekiel|5|15|So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Jehovah, have spoken it;)
Ezekiel|5|16|when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;
Ezekiel|5|17|and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|6|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|6|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,
Ezekiel|6|3|and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
Ezekiel|6|4|And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.
Ezekiel|6|5|And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
Ezekiel|6|6|In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.
Ezekiel|6|7|And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|6|8|Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
Ezekiel|6|9|And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
Ezekiel|6|10|And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
Ezekiel|6|11|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Ezekiel|6|12|He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|6|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.
Ezekiel|6|14|And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|7|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|7|2|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
Ezekiel|7|3|Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|4|And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|7|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|6|An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|7|Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, {a day of} tumult, and not {of} joyful shouting, upon the mountains.
