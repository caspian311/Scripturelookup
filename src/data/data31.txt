1 Chronicles|17|3|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1 Chronicles|17|4|Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
1 Chronicles|17|5|for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from {one} tabernacle {to another}.
1 Chronicles|17|6|In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
1 Chronicles|17|7|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:
1 Chronicles|17|8|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
1 Chronicles|17|9|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
1 Chronicles|17|10|and {as} from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.

1 Chronicles|17|12|He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|13|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
1 Chronicles|17|14|but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|15|According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1 Chronicles|17|16|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?

1 Chronicles|17|18|What can David {say} yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

1 Chronicles|17|22|For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
1 Chronicles|17|23|And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
1 Chronicles|17|24|And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.
1 Chronicles|17|25|For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found {in his heart} to pray before thee.
1 Chronicles|17|26|And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
1 Chronicles|17|27|and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.
