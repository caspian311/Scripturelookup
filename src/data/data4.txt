Matthew|7|20|Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Matthew|7|21|Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|7|22|Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?
Matthew|7|23|And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
Matthew|7|24|Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:
Matthew|7|25|and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.
Matthew|7|26|And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
Matthew|7|27|and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.
Matthew|7|28|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
Matthew|7|29|for he taught them as {one} having authority, and not as their scribes.
Matthew|8|1|And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
Matthew|8|2|And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Matthew|8|3|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew|8|4|And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Matthew|8|5|And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
Matthew|8|6|and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
Matthew|8|7|And he saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
Matthew|8|8|And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Matthew|8|9|For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Matthew|8|10|And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Matthew|8|11|And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
Matthew|8|12|but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|8|13|And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, {so} be it done unto thee. And the servant was healed in that hour.
Matthew|8|14|And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
Matthew|8|15|And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him.
Matthew|8|16|And when even was come, they brought unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick:
Matthew|8|17|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.
Matthew|8|18|Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side.
Matthew|8|19|And there came a scribe, and said unto him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Matthew|8|20|And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven {have} nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Matthew|8|21|And another of the disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Matthew|8|22|But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
Matthew|8|23|And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
Matthew|8|24|And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
Matthew|8|25|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.
Matthew|8|26|And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
Matthew|8|27|And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
Matthew|8|28|And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
Matthew|8|29|And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
Matthew|8|30|Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
Matthew|8|31|And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.
Matthew|8|32|And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.
Matthew|8|33|And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons.
Matthew|8|34|And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought {him} that he would depart from their borders.
Matthew|9|1|And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
Matthew|9|2|And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.
Matthew|9|3|And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
Matthew|9|4|And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
Matthew|9|5|For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?
Matthew|9|6|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up unto thy house.
Matthew|9|7|And he arose, and departed to his house.
Matthew|9|8|But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.
Matthew|9|9|And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
Matthew|9|10|And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew|9|11|And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners?
Matthew|9|12|But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
Matthew|9|13|But go ye and learn what {this} meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Matthew|9|14|Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
Matthew|9|15|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
Matthew|9|16|And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
Matthew|9|17|Neither do {men} put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.
Matthew|9|18|While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
Matthew|9|19|And Jesus arose, and followed him, and {so did} his disciples.
Matthew|9|20|And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:
Matthew|9|21|for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.
Matthew|9|22|But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
Matthew|9|23|And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,
Matthew|9|24|he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
Matthew|9|25|But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.
Matthew|9|26|And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.
Matthew|9|27|And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|9|28|And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew|9|29|Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.
Matthew|9|30|And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
Matthew|9|31|But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
Matthew|9|32|And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
Matthew|9|33|And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
Matthew|9|34|But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
Matthew|9|35|And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
Matthew|9|36|But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Matthew|9|37|Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
Matthew|9|38|Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
Matthew|10|1|And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
Matthew|10|2|Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew|10|3|Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the {son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew|10|4|Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
Matthew|10|5|These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged them, saying, Go not into {any} way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans:
Matthew|10|6|but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|10|7|And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|10|8|Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.
Matthew|10|9|Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
Matthew|10|10|no wallet for {your} journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
Matthew|10|11|And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.
Matthew|10|12|And as ye enter into the house, salute it.
Matthew|10|13|And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
Matthew|10|14|And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.
Matthew|10|15|Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Matthew|10|16|Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Matthew|10|17|But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you;
Matthew|10|18|yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
