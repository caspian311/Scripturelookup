1 Samuel|26|4|David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.
1 Samuel|26|5|And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.
1 Samuel|26|6|Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1 Samuel|26|7|So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
1 Samuel|26|8|Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.
1 Samuel|26|9|And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah’s anointed, and be guiltless?
1 Samuel|26|10|And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
1 Samuel|26|11|Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
1 Samuel|26|12|So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.
1 Samuel|26|13|Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
1 Samuel|26|14|and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
1 Samuel|26|15|And David said to Abner, Art not thou a {valiant} man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
1 Samuel|26|16|This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
1 Samuel|26|17|And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1 Samuel|26|18|And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
1 Samuel|26|19|Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
1 Samuel|26|20|Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
1 Samuel|26|21|Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
1 Samuel|26|22|And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.
1 Samuel|26|23|And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|26|24|And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
1 Samuel|26|25|Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1 Samuel|27|1|And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
1 Samuel|27|2|And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1 Samuel|27|3|And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
1 Samuel|27|4|And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1 Samuel|27|5|And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
1 Samuel|27|6|Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
1 Samuel|27|7|And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1 Samuel|27|8|And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those {nations} were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|27|9|And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.
1 Samuel|27|10|And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
1 Samuel|27|11|And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|27|12|And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1 Samuel|28|1|And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.
1 Samuel|28|2|And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.
1 Samuel|28|3|Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1 Samuel|28|4|And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
1 Samuel|28|5|And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
1 Samuel|28|6|And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
1 Samuel|28|7|Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
1 Samuel|28|8|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.
1 Samuel|28|9|And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1 Samuel|28|10|And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
1 Samuel|28|11|Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1 Samuel|28|12|And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
1 Samuel|28|13|And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
1 Samuel|28|14|And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
1 Samuel|28|15|And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
1 Samuel|28|16|And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?
1 Samuel|28|17|And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.
1 Samuel|28|18|Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.
1 Samuel|28|19|Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|28|20|Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
1 Samuel|28|21|And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
1 Samuel|28|22|Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
1 Samuel|28|23|But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1 Samuel|28|24|And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
1 Samuel|28|25|and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
1 Samuel|29|1|Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.
1 Samuel|29|2|And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
1 Samuel|29|3|Then said the princes of the Philistines, What {do} these Hebrews {here}? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or {rather} these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away {unto me} unto this day?
1 Samuel|29|4|But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this {fellow} reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?
1 Samuel|29|5|Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,             Saul hath slain his thousands,                    And David his ten thousands?
1 Samuel|29|6|Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
1 Samuel|29|7|Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|29|8|And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1 Samuel|29|9|And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1 Samuel|29|10|Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
1 Samuel|29|11|So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1 Samuel|30|1|And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
1 Samuel|30|2|and had taken captive the women {and all} that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.
1 Samuel|30|3|And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
1 Samuel|30|4|Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
1 Samuel|30|5|And David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
1 Samuel|30|6|And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.
1 Samuel|30|7|And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
1 Samuel|30|8|And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake {them}, and shalt without fail recover {all}.
1 Samuel|30|9|So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
1 Samuel|30|10|But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1 Samuel|30|11|And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink.
1 Samuel|30|12|And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
1 Samuel|30|13|And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
1 Samuel|30|14|We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1 Samuel|30|15|And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
1 Samuel|30|16|And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
1 Samuel|30|17|And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.
1 Samuel|30|18|And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel|30|19|And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.
1 Samuel|30|20|And David took all the flocks and the herds, {which} they drove before those {other} cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.
1 Samuel|30|21|And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
1 Samuel|30|22|Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.
1 Samuel|30|23|Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
1 Samuel|30|24|And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.
1 Samuel|30|25|And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
1 Samuel|30|26|And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:
1 Samuel|30|27|To them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,
1 Samuel|30|28|and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,
1 Samuel|30|29|and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,
1 Samuel|30|30|and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,
