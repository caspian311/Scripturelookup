Job|32|15|They are amazed, they answer no more:                   They have not a word to say.
Job|32|16|And shall I wait, because they speak not,                   Because they stand still, and answer no more?
Job|32|17|I also will answer my part,                   I also will show mine opinion.
Job|32|18|For I am full of words;                   The spirit within me constraineth me.
Job|32|19|Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent;                   Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
Job|32|20|I will speak, that I may be refreshed;                   I will open my lips and answer.
Job|32|21|Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person;                   Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
Job|32|22|For I know not to give flattering titles;                           {Else} would my Maker soon take me away.
Job|33|1|Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech,                   And hearken to all my words.
Job|33|2|Behold now, I have opened my mouth;                   My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
Job|33|3|My words {shall utter} the uprightness of my heart;                   And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job|33|4|The Spirit of God hath made me,                   And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.
Job|33|5|If thou canst, answer thou me;                   Set {thy words} in order before me, stand forth.
Job|33|6|Behold, I am toward God even as thou art:                   I also am formed out of the clay.
Job|33|7|Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,                   Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.
Job|33|8|Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing,                   And I have heard the voice of {thy} words, {saying},
Job|33|9|I am clean, without transgression;                   I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:
Job|33|10|Behold, he findeth occasions against me,                   He counteth me for his enemy:
Job|33|11|He putteth my feet in the stocks,                   He marketh all my paths.
Job|33|12|Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just;                   For God is greater than man.
Job|33|13|Why dost thou strive against him,                   For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?
Job|33|14|For God speaketh once,                   Yea twice, {though man} regardeth it not.
Job|33|15|In a dream, in a vision of the night,                   When deep sleep falleth upon men,                   In slumberings upon the bed;
Job|33|16|Then he openeth the ears of men,                   And sealeth their instruction,
Job|33|17|That he may withdraw man {from his} purpose,                   And hide pride from man;
Job|33|18|He keepeth back his soul from the pit,                   And his life from perishing by the sword.
Job|33|19|He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,                   And with continual strife in his bones;
Job|33|20|So that his life abhorreth bread,                   And his soul dainty food.
Job|33|21|His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;                   And his bones that were not seen stick out.
Job|33|22|Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit,                   And his life to the destroyers.
Job|33|23|If there be with him an angel,                   An interpreter, one among a thousand,                   To show unto man what is right for him;
Job|33|24|Then {God} is gracious unto him, and saith,                   Deliver him from going down to the pit,                   I have found a ransom.
Job|33|25|His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s;                   He returneth to the days of his youth.
Job|33|26|He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him,                   So that he seeth his face with joy:                   And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.
Job|33|27|He singeth before men, and saith,                   I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,                   And it profited me not:
Job|33|28|He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit,                   And my life shall behold the light.
Job|33|29|Lo, all these things doth God work,                   Twice, {yea} thrice, with a man,
Job|33|30|To bring back his soul from the pit,                   That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job|33|31|Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:                   Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
Job|33|32|If thou hast anything to say, answer me:                   Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
Job|33|33|If not, hearken thou unto me:                   Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
Job|34|1|Moreover Elihu answered and said,
Job|34|2|Hear my words, ye wise men;                   And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
Job|34|3|For the ear trieth words,                   As the palate tasteth food.
Job|34|4|Let us choose for us that which is right:                   Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job|34|5|For Job hath said, I am righteous,                   And God hath taken away my right:
Job|34|6|Notwithstanding my right I am {accounted} a liar;                   My wound is incurable, {though I am} without transgression.
Job|34|7|What man is like Job,                   Who drinketh up scoffing like water,
Job|34|8|Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,                   And walketh with wicked men?
Job|34|9|For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing                   That he should delight himself with God.
Job|34|10|Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:                   Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,                   And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
Job|34|11|For the work of a man will he render unto him,                   And cause every man to find according to his ways.
Job|34|12|Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,                   Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
Job|34|13|Who gave him a charge over the earth?                   Or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job|34|14|If he set his heart upon himself,                           {If} he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job|34|15|All flesh shall perish together,                   And man shall turn again unto dust.
Job|34|16|If now {thou hast} understanding, hear this:                   Hearken to the voice of my words.
Job|34|17|Shall even one that hateth justice govern?                   And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous {and} mighty?-
Job|34|18|{Him} that saith to a king, {Thou art} vile,                           {Or} to nobles, {Ye are} wicked;
Job|34|19|That respecteth not the persons of princes,                   Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;                   For they all are the work of his hands.
Job|34|20|In a moment they die, even at midnight;                   The people are shaken and pass away,                   And the mighty are taken away without hand.
Job|34|21|For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,                   And he seeth all his goings.
Job|34|22|There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,                   Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job|34|23|For he needeth not further to consider a man,                   That he should go before God in judgment.
Job|34|24|He breaketh in pieces mighty men {in ways} past finding out,                   And setteth others in their stead.
Job|34|25|Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;                   And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job|34|26|He striketh them as wicked men                   In the open sight of others;
Job|34|27|Because they turned aside from following him,                   And would not have regard in any of his ways:
Job|34|28|So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,                   And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
Job|34|29|When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?                   And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?                   Alike whether {it be done} unto a nation, or unto a man:
Job|34|30|That the godless man reign not,                   That there be none to ensnare the people.
Job|34|31|For hath any said unto God,                   I have borne {chastisement}, I will not offend {any more}:
Job|34|32|That which I see not teach thou me:                   If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
Job|34|33|Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?                   For thou must choose, and not I:                   Therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job|34|34|Men of understanding will say unto me,                   Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
Job|34|35|Job speaketh without knowledge,                   And his words are without wisdom.
Job|34|36|Would that Job were tried unto the end,                   Because of his answering like wicked men.
Job|34|37|For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;                   He clappeth his hands among us,                   And multiplieth his words against God.
Job|35|1|Moreover Elihu answered and said,
Job|35|2|Thinkest thou this to be {thy} right,                           {Or} sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,
Job|35|3|That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?                           {And}, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
Job|35|4|I will answer thee,                   And thy companions with thee.
Job|35|5|Look unto the heavens, and see;                   And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
Job|35|6|If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him?                   And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job|35|7|If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?                   Or what receiveth he of thy hand?
Job|35|8|Thy wickedness {may hurt} a man as thou art;                   And thy righteousness {may profit} a son of man.
Job|35|9|By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;                   They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job|35|10|But none saith, Where is God my Maker,                   Who giveth songs in the night,
Job|35|11|Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,                   And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
Job|35|12|There they cry, but none giveth answer,                   Because of the pride of evil men.
Job|35|13|Surely God will not hear an empty {cry},                   Neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job|35|14|How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not,                   The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
Job|35|15|But now, because he hath not visited in his anger,                   Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
Job|35|16|Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity;                   He multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job|36|1|Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job|36|2|Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;                   For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf.
Job|36|3|I will fetch my knowledge from afar,                   And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job|36|4|For truly my words are not false:                   One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job|36|5|Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:                   He is mighty in strength of understanding.
Job|36|6|He preserveth not the life of the wicked,                   But giveth to the afflicted {their} right.
