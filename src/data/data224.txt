Ephesians|5|2|and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.
Ephesians|5|3|But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;
Ephesians|5|4|nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians|5|5|For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians|5|6|Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians|5|7|Be not ye therefore partakers with them;
Ephesians|5|8|For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light
Ephesians|5|9|(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Ephesians|5|10|proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;
Ephesians|5|11|and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
Ephesians|5|12|for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.
Ephesians|5|13|But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.
Ephesians|5|14|Wherefore {he} saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.
Ephesians|5|15|Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
Ephesians|5|16|redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians|5|17|Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians|5|18|And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;
Ephesians|5|19|speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
Ephesians|5|20|giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
Ephesians|5|21|subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians|5|22|Wives, {be in subjection} unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
Ephesians|5|23|For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, {being} himself the saviour of the body.
Ephesians|5|24|But as the church is subject to Christ, so {let} the wives also {be} to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians|5|25|Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;
Ephesians|5|26|that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
Ephesians|5|27|that he might present the church to himself a glorious {church}, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Ephesians|5|28|Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:
Ephesians|5|29|for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;
Ephesians|5|30|because we are members of his body.
Ephesians|5|31|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.
Ephesians|5|32|This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.
Ephesians|5|33|Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and {let} the wife {see} that she fear her husband.
Ephesians|6|1|Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Ephesians|6|2|Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),
Ephesians|6|3|that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
Ephesians|6|4|And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians|6|5|Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
Ephesians|6|6|not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Ephesians|6|7|with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men:
Ephesians|6|8|knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth, the same shall he receive again from the Lord, whether {he be} bond or free.
Ephesians|6|9|And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
Ephesians|6|10|Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
Ephesians|6|11|Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Ephesians|6|12|For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual {hosts} of wickedness in the heavenly {places}.
Ephesians|6|13|Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
Ephesians|6|14|Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
Ephesians|6|15|and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians|6|16|withal taking up the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil {one}.
Ephesians|6|17|And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians|6|18|with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,
Ephesians|6|19|And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians|6|20|for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians|6|21|But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
Ephesians|6|22|whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians|6|23|Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|6|24|Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ with {a love} incorruptible.
Galatians|1|1|Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
Galatians|1|2|and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
Galatians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians|1|4|who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
Galatians|1|5|to whom {be} the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians|1|6|I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;
Galatians|1|7|which is not another {gospel} only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians|1|8|But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|9|As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|10|For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.
Galatians|1|11|For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.
Galatians|1|12|For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but {it came to me} through revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians|1|13|For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:
Galatians|1|14|and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians|1|15|But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, {even} from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,
Galatians|1|16|to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Galatians|1|17|neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.
Galatians|1|18|Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.
Galatians|1|19|But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
Galatians|1|20|Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
Galatians|1|21|Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians|1|22|And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
Galatians|1|23|but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;
Galatians|1|24|and they glorified God in me.
Galatians|2|1|Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
Galatians|2|2|And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.
Galatians|2|3|But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
Galatians|2|4|and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Galatians|2|5|to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Galatians|2|6|But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:
Galatians|2|7|but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with {the gospel} of the circumcision
Galatians|2|8|(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);
Galatians|2|9|and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;
Galatians|2|10|only {they would} that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.
Galatians|2|11|But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians|2|12|For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.
Galatians|2|13|And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians|2|14|But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before {them} all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
Galatians|2|15|We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
Galatians|2|16|yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Galatians|2|17|But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.
Galatians|2|18|For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.
Galatians|2|19|For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.
Galatians|2|20|I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me: and that {life} which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, {the faith} which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.
