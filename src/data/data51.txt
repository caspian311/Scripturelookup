Jeremiah|29|11|For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.
Jeremiah|29|12|And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
Jeremiah|29|13|And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
Jeremiah|29|14|And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places wither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
Jeremiah|29|15|Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
Jeremiah|29|16|thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
Jeremiah|29|17|thus saith Jehovah of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|29|18|And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them;
Jeremiah|29|19|because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|20|Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah|29|21|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
Jeremiah|29|22|and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
Jeremiah|29|23|because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|24|And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,
Jeremiah|29|25|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jeremiah|29|26|Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.
Jeremiah|29|27|Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,
Jeremiah|29|28|forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, {The captivity} is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
Jeremiah|29|29|And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah|29|30|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|29|31|Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;
Jeremiah|29|32|therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|30|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|30|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
Jeremiah|30|3|For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
Jeremiah|30|4|And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah|30|5|For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
Jeremiah|30|6|Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
Jeremiah|30|7|Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
Jeremiah|30|8|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;
Jeremiah|30|9|but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
Jeremiah|30|10|Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
Jeremiah|30|11|For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.
Jeremiah|30|12|For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.
Jeremiah|30|13|There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
Jeremiah|30|14|All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
Jeremiah|30|15|Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
Jeremiah|30|16|Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
Jeremiah|30|17|For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; because they have called thee an outcast, {saying}, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
Jeremiah|30|18|Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
Jeremiah|30|19|And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
Jeremiah|30|20|Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.
Jeremiah|30|21|And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|30|22|And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Jeremiah|30|23|Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, {even his} wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|30|24|The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.
Jeremiah|31|1|At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
Jeremiah|31|2|Thus saith Jehovah, The people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
Jeremiah|31|3|Jehovah appeared of old unto me, {saying}, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
Jeremiah|31|4|Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
Jeremiah|31|5|Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy {the fruit thereof}.
Jeremiah|31|6|For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|31|7|For thus saith Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
Jeremiah|31|8|Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, {and} with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither.
Jeremiah|31|9|They shall come with weeping; and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
Jeremiah|31|10|Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd doth his flock.
Jeremiah|31|11|For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
Jeremiah|31|12|And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of Jehovah, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
Jeremiah|31|13|Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
Jeremiah|31|14|And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|15|Thus saith Jehovah: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
Jeremiah|31|16|Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
Jeremiah|31|17|And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah; and {thy} children shall come again to their own border.
Jeremiah|31|18|I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself {thus}, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed {to the yoke}: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.
Jeremiah|31|19|Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
Jeremiah|31|20|Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|21|Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
Jeremiah|31|22|How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.
Jeremiah|31|23|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.
Jeremiah|31|24|And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
Jeremiah|31|25|For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
Jeremiah|31|26|Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
Jeremiah|31|27|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
Jeremiah|31|28|And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|29|In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|30|But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|31|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Jeremiah|31|32|not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|33|But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
Jeremiah|31|34|and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
Jeremiah|31|35|Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:
Jeremiah|31|36|If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
Jeremiah|31|37|Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|38|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.
Jeremiah|31|39|And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.
Jeremiah|31|40|And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
Jeremiah|32|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
Jeremiah|32|2|Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.
Jeremiah|32|3|For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
Jeremiah|32|4|and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
Jeremiah|32|5|and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?
Jeremiah|32|6|And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|32|7|Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
Jeremiah|32|8|So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|32|9|And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah|32|10|And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
Jeremiah|32|11|So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, {according to} the law and custom, and that which was open:
Jeremiah|32|12|and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s {son}, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|32|13|And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
Jeremiah|32|14|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.
