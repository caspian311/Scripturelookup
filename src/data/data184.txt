Mark|11|13|And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
Mark|11|14|And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.
Mark|11|15|And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Mark|11|16|and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.
Mark|11|17|And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.
Mark|11|18|And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
Mark|11|19|And every evening he went forth out of the city.
Mark|11|20|And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
Mark|11|21|And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
Mark|11|22|And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark|11|23|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.
Mark|11|24|Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
Mark|11|25|And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
Mark|11|26|{But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.}
Mark|11|27|And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;
Mark|11|28|and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?
Mark|11|29|And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|11|30|The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.
Mark|11|31|And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Mark|11|32|But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.
Mark|11|33|And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|12|1|And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Mark|12|2|And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.
Mark|12|3|And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
Mark|12|4|And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.
Mark|12|5|And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Mark|12|6|He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark|12|7|But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
Mark|12|8|And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.
Mark|12|9|What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
Mark|12|10|Have ye not read even this scripture:             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner;
Mark|12|11|This was from the Lord,                   And it is marvellous in our eyes?
Mark|12|12|And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.
Mark|12|13|And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.
Mark|12|14|And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Mark|12|15|Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why make ye trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
Mark|12|16|And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
Mark|12|17|And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.
Mark|12|18|And there come unto him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Mark|12|19|Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mark|12|20|There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;
Mark|12|21|and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:
Mark|12|22|and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
Mark|12|23|In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
Mark|12|24|Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
Mark|12|25|For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.
Mark|12|26|But as touching the dead, that they are raised; have ye not read in the book of Moses, in {the place concerning} the Bush, how God spake unto him, saying, I {am} the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark|12|27|He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err.
Mark|12|28|And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?
Mark|12|29|Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:
Mark|12|30|and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
Mark|12|31|The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
Mark|12|32|And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:
Mark|12|33|and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
Mark|12|34|And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
Mark|12|35|And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark|12|36|David himself said in the Holy Spirit,             The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Mark|12|37|David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark|12|38|And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and {to have} salutations in the marketplaces,
Mark|12|39|and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:
Mark|12|40|they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.
Mark|12|41|And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
Mark|12|42|And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.
Mark|12|43|And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury:
Mark|12|44|for they all did cast in of their superfluity; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, {even} all her living.
Mark|13|1|And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings!
Mark|13|2|And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.
Mark|13|3|And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Mark|13|4|Tell us, when shall these things be? and what {shall be} the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?
Mark|13|5|And Jesus began to say unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
Mark|13|6|Many shall come in my name, saying, I am {he}; and shall lead many astray.
Mark|13|7|And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled: {these things} must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
Mark|13|8|For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail.
Mark|13|9|But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|13|10|And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations.
Mark|13|11|And when they lead you {to judgment}, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
Mark|13|12|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Mark|13|13|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Mark|13|14|But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains:
Mark|13|15|and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out his house:
Mark|13|16|and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
Mark|13|17|But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
Mark|13|18|And pray ye that it be not in the winter.
Mark|13|19|For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be.
Mark|13|20|And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect’s sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days.
Mark|13|21|And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there; believe {it} not:
Mark|13|22|for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.
Mark|13|23|But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
Mark|13|24|But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
Mark|13|25|and the stars shall be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.
Mark|13|26|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Mark|13|27|And then shall he send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Mark|13|28|Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;
Mark|13|29|even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that he is nigh, {even} at the doors.
Mark|13|30|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished.
Mark|13|31|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark|13|32|But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Mark|13|33|Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark|13|34|{It is} as {when} a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch.
Mark|13|35|Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning;
