John|9|21|but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.
John|9|22|These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him {to be} Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John|9|23|Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
John|9|24|So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
John|9|25|He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
John|9|26|They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?
John|9|27|He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?
John|9|28|And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
John|9|29|We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
John|9|30|The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and {yet} he opened mine eyes.
John|9|31|We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.
John|9|32|Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John|9|33|If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
John|9|34|They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
John|9|35|Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
John|9|36|He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?
John|9|37|Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.
John|9|38|And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
John|9|39|And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.
John|9|40|Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?
John|9|41|Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.
John|10|1|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
John|10|2|But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John|10|3|To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
John|10|4|When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
John|10|5|And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
John|10|6|This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
John|10|7|Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
John|10|8|All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
John|10|9|I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.
John|10|10|The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have {it} abundantly.
John|10|11|I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
John|10|12|He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth {them}:
John|10|13|{he fleeth} because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
John|10|14|I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,
John|10|15|even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John|10|16|And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.
John|10|17|Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
John|10|18|No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.
John|10|19|There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.
John|10|20|And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
John|10|21|Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
John|10|22|And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:
John|10|23|it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
John|10|24|The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
John|10|25|Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.
John|10|26|But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.
John|10|27|My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John|10|28|and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
John|10|29|My Father, who hath given {them} unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch {them} out of the Father’s hand.
John|10|30|I and the Father are one.
John|10|31|The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John|10|32|Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John|10|33|The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
John|10|34|Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?
John|10|35|If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
John|10|36|say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am {the} Son of God?
John|10|37|If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
John|10|38|But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
John|10|39|They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
John|10|40|And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there be abode.
John|10|41|And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
John|10|42|And many believed on him there.
John|11|1|Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
John|11|2|And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John|11|3|The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John|11|4|But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
John|11|5|Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John|11|6|When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.
John|11|7|Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
John|11|8|The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
John|11|9|Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John|11|10|But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
John|11|11|These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John|11|12|The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.
John|11|13|Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.
John|11|14|Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John|11|15|And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
John|11|16|Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John|11|17|So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
John|11|18|Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
John|11|19|and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
John|11|20|Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.
John|11|21|Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|22|And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
John|11|23|Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John|11|24|Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John|11|25|Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;
John|11|26|and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?
John|11|27|She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, {even} he that cometh into the world.
John|11|28|And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.
John|11|29|And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.
John|11|30|(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)
John|11|31|The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.
John|11|32|Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|33|When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews {also} weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
John|11|34|and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.
John|11|35|Jesus wept.
John|11|36|The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!
John|11|37|But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?
