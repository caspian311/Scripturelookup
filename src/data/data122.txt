Joshua|15|12|And the west border was to the great sea, and the border {thereof}. This is the border of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
Joshua|15|13|And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, even Kiriath-arba, {which Arba was} the father of Anak (the same is Hebron).
Joshua|15|14|And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
Joshua|15|15|And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua|15|16|And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|17|And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|18|And it came to pass, when she came {unto him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?
Joshua|15|19|And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
Joshua|15|20|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
Joshua|15|21|And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
Joshua|15|22|and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
Joshua|15|23|and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

Joshua|15|28|and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,
Joshua|15|29|Baalah, and Iim, and Ezem,
Joshua|15|30|and Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,
Joshua|15|31|and Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,
Joshua|15|32|and Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages.
Joshua|15|33|In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,
Joshua|15|34|and Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
Joshua|15|35|Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
Joshua|15|36|and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|37|Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,
Joshua|15|38|and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
Joshua|15|39|Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
Joshua|15|40|and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
Joshua|15|41|and Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|42|Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
Joshua|15|43|and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
Joshua|15|44|and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|45|Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
Joshua|15|46|from Ekron even unto the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod, with their villages.
Joshua|15|47|Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; unto the brook of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border {thereof}.
Joshua|15|48|And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
Joshua|15|49|and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the same is Debir),
Joshua|15|50|and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
Joshua|15|51|and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|52|Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
Joshua|15|53|and Janim, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,
Joshua|15|54|and Humtah, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|55|Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
Joshua|15|56|and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
Joshua|15|57|Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.

Joshua|15|60|Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|61|In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
Joshua|15|62|and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
Joshua|15|63|And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
Joshua|16|1|And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;
Joshua|16|2|and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;
Joshua|16|3|and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.
Joshua|16|4|And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
Joshua|16|5|And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was {thus}: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;
Joshua|16|6|and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
Joshua|16|7|and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
Joshua|16|8|From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;
Joshua|16|9|together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
Joshua|16|10|And they drove not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and are become servants to do taskwork.
Joshua|17|1|And {this} was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua|17|2|So {the lot} was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua|17|3|But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua|17|4|And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
Joshua|17|5|And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
Joshua|17|6|because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
Joshua|17|7|And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua|17|8|The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
Joshua|17|9|And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:
Joshua|17|10|southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
Joshua|17|11|And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
Joshua|17|12|Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out {the inhabitants of} those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Joshua|17|13|And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxed strong, that they put the Canaanites to taskwork, and did not utterly drive them out.
Joshua|17|14|And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?
Joshua|17|15|And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
Joshua|17|16|And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
Joshua|17|17|And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:
Joshua|17|18|but the hill-country shall be thine; for though it is a forest, thou shalt cut it down, and the goings out thereof shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.
Joshua|18|1|And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua|18|2|And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.
Joshua|18|3|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?
Joshua|18|4|Appoint for you three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.
Joshua|18|5|And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.
Joshua|18|6|And ye shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring {the description} hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.
Joshua|18|7|For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them.
Joshua|18|8|And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.
Joshua|18|9|And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua|18|10|And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
Joshua|18|11|And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua|18|12|And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua|18|13|And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether.
Joshua|18|14|And the border extended {thence}, and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
Joshua|18|15|And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;
Joshua|18|16|and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;
Joshua|18|17|and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|18|18|and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;
Joshua|18|19|and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border.
Joshua|18|20|And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
