Genesis|24|52|And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.
Genesis|24|53|And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
Genesis|24|54|And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
Genesis|24|55|And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us {a few} days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.
Genesis|24|56|And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
Genesis|24|57|And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
Genesis|24|58|And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Genesis|24|59|And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
Genesis|24|60|And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou {the mother} of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.
Genesis|24|61|And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
Genesis|24|62|And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.
Genesis|24|63|And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
Genesis|24|64|And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
Genesis|24|65|And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.
Genesis|24|66|And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis|24|67|And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
Genesis|25|1|And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
Genesis|25|2|And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
Genesis|25|3|And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
Genesis|25|4|And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Genesis|25|5|And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Genesis|25|6|But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
Genesis|25|7|And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Genesis|25|8|And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis|25|9|And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
Genesis|25|10|The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
Genesis|25|11|And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
Genesis|25|12|Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham.
Genesis|25|13|And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
Genesis|25|14|and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Genesis|25|15|Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
Genesis|25|16|These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.
Genesis|25|17|And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis|25|18|And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren.
Genesis|25|19|And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begat Isaac.
Genesis|25|20|And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
Genesis|25|21|And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis|25|22|And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
Genesis|25|23|And Jehovah said unto her,             Two nations are in thy womb,                   And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels.                   And the one people shall be stronger than the other people.                   And the elder shall serve the younger.
Genesis|25|24|And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis|25|25|And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.
Genesis|25|26|And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
Genesis|25|27|And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
Genesis|25|28|Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis|25|29|And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
Genesis|25|30|And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
Genesis|25|31|And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.
Genesis|25|32|And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?
Genesis|25|33|And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Genesis|25|34|And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
Genesis|26|1|And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
Genesis|26|2|And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
Genesis|26|3|Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.
Genesis|26|4|And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|26|5|Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Genesis|26|6|And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
Genesis|26|7|And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, {said he}, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon.
Genesis|26|8|And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
Genesis|26|9|And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
Genesis|26|10|And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
Genesis|26|11|And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Genesis|26|12|And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.
Genesis|26|13|And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
Genesis|26|14|And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.
Genesis|26|15|Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
Genesis|26|16|And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we.
Genesis|26|17|And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
Genesis|26|18|And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
Genesis|26|19|And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
Genesis|26|20|And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Genesis|26|21|And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
Genesis|26|22|And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Genesis|26|23|And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
Genesis|26|24|And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
Genesis|26|25|And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac’s servants digged a well.
Genesis|26|26|Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
Genesis|26|27|And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
Genesis|26|28|And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
Genesis|26|29|that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.
Genesis|26|30|And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
Genesis|26|31|And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis|26|32|And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
Genesis|26|33|And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
Genesis|26|34|And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
Genesis|26|35|And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Genesis|27|1|And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I.
Genesis|27|2|And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
Genesis|27|3|Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
Genesis|27|4|And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die.
Genesis|27|5|And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Genesis|27|6|And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Genesis|27|7|Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.
Genesis|27|8|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Genesis|27|9|Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth.
Genesis|27|10|And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
Genesis|27|11|And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Genesis|27|12|My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
Genesis|27|13|And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
Genesis|27|14|And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
Genesis|27|15|And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
