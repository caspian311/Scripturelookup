Ecclesiastes|10|7|I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|10|8|He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
Ecclesiastes|10|9|Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; {and} he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
Ecclesiastes|10|10|If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
Ecclesiastes|10|11|If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
Ecclesiastes|10|12|The words of a wise manâ€™s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
Ecclesiastes|10|13|The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
Ecclesiastes|10|14|A fool also multiplieth words: {yet} man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
Ecclesiastes|10|15|The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.
Ecclesiastes|10|16|Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
Ecclesiastes|10|17|Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Ecclesiastes|10|18|By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
Ecclesiastes|10|19|A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.
Ecclesiastes|10|20|Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
Ecclesiastes|11|1|Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes|11|2|Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|11|3|If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
Ecclesiastes|11|4|He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
Ecclesiastes|11|5|As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, {nor} how the bones {do grow} in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.
Ecclesiastes|11|6|In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
Ecclesiastes|11|7|Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
Ecclesiastes|11|8|Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|11|9|Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
Ecclesiastes|11|10|Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
Ecclesiastes|12|1|Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes|12|2|before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
Ecclesiastes|12|3|in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,
Ecclesiastes|12|4|and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
Ecclesiastes|12|5|yea, they shall be afraid of {that which is} high, and terrors {shall be} in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes|12|6|before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
Ecclesiastes|12|7|and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes|12|8|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|12|9|And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, {and} set in order many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes|12|10|The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written uprightly, {even} words of truth.
Ecclesiastes|12|11|The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened are {the words of} the masters of assemblies, {which} are given from one shepherd.
Ecclesiastes|12|12|And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes|12|13|{This is} the end of the matter; all hath been heard: fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole {duty} of man.
Ecclesiastes|12|14|For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
2 Kings|1|1|And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings|1|2|And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.
2 Kings|1|3|But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
2 Kings|1|4|Now therefore thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
2 Kings|1|5|And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?
2 Kings|1|6|And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
2 Kings|1|7|And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?
2 Kings|1|8|And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
2 Kings|1|9|Then {the king} sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
2 Kings|1|10|And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|11|And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
2 Kings|1|12|And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|13|And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|14|Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|15|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
2 Kings|1|16|And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
2 Kings|1|17|So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings|1|18|Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|2|1|And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
2 Kings|2|2|And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
2 Kings|2|3|And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|4|And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
2 Kings|2|5|And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|6|And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
2 Kings|2|7|And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|8|And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2 Kings|2|9|And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2 Kings|2|10|And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: {nevertheless}, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
2 Kings|2|11|And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, {there appeared} a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2 Kings|2|12|And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!      And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2 Kings|2|13|He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|14|And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.
2 Kings|2|15|And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2 Kings|2|16|And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
2 Kings|2|17|And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2 Kings|2|18|And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
2 Kings|2|19|And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.
2 Kings|2|20|And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
2 Kings|2|21|And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.
2 Kings|2|22|So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.
2 Kings|2|23|And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.
2 Kings|2|24|And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.
2 Kings|2|25|And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings|3|1|Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
2 Kings|3|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
2 Kings|3|3|Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2 Kings|3|4|Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.
2 Kings|3|5|But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings|3|6|And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings|3|7|And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
2 Kings|3|8|And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
2 Kings|3|9|So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven daysâ€™ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.
2 Kings|3|10|And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|11|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israelâ€™s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
2 Kings|3|12|And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
2 Kings|3|13|And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|14|And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
2 Kings|3|15|But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.
2 Kings|3|16|And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.
2 Kings|3|17|For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.
2 Kings|3|18|And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings|3|19|And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
