Jeremiah|21|6|And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
Jeremiah|21|7|And afterward, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
Jeremiah|21|8|And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Jeremiah|21|9|He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
Jeremiah|21|10|For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
Jeremiah|21|11|And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Jeremiah|21|12|O house of David, thus saith Jehovah, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah|21|13|Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, {and} of the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
Jeremiah|21|14|And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.
Jeremiah|22|1|Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
Jeremiah|22|2|And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.
Jeremiah|22|3|Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah|22|4|For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
Jeremiah|22|5|But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.
Jeremiah|22|6|For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou art Gilead unto me, {and} the head of Lebanon; {yet} surely I will make thee a wilderness, {and} cities which are not inhabited.
Jeremiah|22|7|And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
Jeremiah|22|8|And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?
Jeremiah|22|9|Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
Jeremiah|22|10|Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
Jeremiah|22|11|For thus saith Jehovah touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, {and} who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more.
Jeremiah|22|12|But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.
Jeremiah|22|13|Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighborâ€™s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;
Jeremiah|22|14|that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
Jeremiah|22|15|Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.
Jeremiah|22|16|He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|17|But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
Jeremiah|22|18|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, {saying}, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, {saying} Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
Jeremiah|22|19|He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|22|20|Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.
Jeremiah|22|21|I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
Jeremiah|22|22|The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
Jeremiah|22|23|O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
Jeremiah|22|24|As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
Jeremiah|22|25|and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|22|26|And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
Jeremiah|22|27|But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.
Jeremiah|22|28|Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?
Jeremiah|22|29|O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|30|Thus saith Jehovah, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.
Jeremiah|23|1|Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|2|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|3|And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah|23|4|And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|5|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah|23|6|In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
Jeremiah|23|7|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah|23|8|but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
Jeremiah|23|9|Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.
Jeremiah|23|10|For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;
Jeremiah|23|11|for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|12|Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|13|And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
Jeremiah|23|14|In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
Jeremiah|23|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
Jeremiah|23|16|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|17|They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.
Jeremiah|23|18|For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?
Jeremiah|23|19|Behold, the tempest of Jehovah, {even his} wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|23|20|The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.
Jeremiah|23|21|I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.
Jeremiah|23|22|But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah|23|23|Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah|23|24|Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|25|I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
Jeremiah|23|26|How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
Jeremiah|23|27|that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.
Jeremiah|23|28|The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|29|Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
Jeremiah|23|30|Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
Jeremiah|23|31|Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
Jeremiah|23|32|Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|33|And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|34|And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.
Jeremiah|23|35|Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|36|And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every manâ€™s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.
Jeremiah|23|37|Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|38|But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
Jeremiah|23|39|therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:
Jeremiah|23|40|and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
Jeremiah|24|1|Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|24|2|One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
Jeremiah|24|3|Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|24|4|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|24|5|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
Jeremiah|24|6|For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah|24|7|And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah|24|8|And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah|24|9|I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
Jeremiah|24|10|And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
Jeremiah|25|1|The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,)
Jeremiah|25|2|which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
Jeremiah|25|3|From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
Jeremiah|25|4|And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,)
Jeremiah|25|5|saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;
Jeremiah|25|6|and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
Jeremiah|25|7|Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
Jeremiah|25|8|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,
Jeremiah|25|9|behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith Jehovah, and {I will send} unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
Jeremiah|25|10|Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
Jeremiah|25|11|And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
