Titus|1|1|Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
Titus|1|2|in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
Titus|1|3|but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus|1|4|to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
Titus|1|5|For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
Titus|1|6|if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus|1|7|For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
Titus|1|8|but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
Titus|1|9|holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
Titus|1|10|For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
Titus|1|11|whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
Titus|1|12|One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
Titus|1|13|This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus|1|14|not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus|1|15|To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus|1|16|They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
Titus|2|1|But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
Titus|2|2|that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
Titus|2|3|that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
Titus|2|4|that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus|2|5|{to be} sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
Titus|2|6|the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
Titus|2|7|in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine {showing} uncorruptness, gravity,
Titus|2|8|sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
Titus|2|9|{Exhort} servants to be in subjection to their own masters, {and} to be well-pleasing {to them} in all things; not gainsaying;
Titus|2|10|not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus|2|11|For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus|2|12|instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
Titus|2|13|looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus|2|14|who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
Titus|2|15|These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
Titus|3|1|Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
Titus|3|2|to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
Titus|3|3|For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus|3|4|But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
Titus|3|5|not by works {done} in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus|3|6|which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus|3|7|that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus|3|8|Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
Titus|3|9|but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus|3|10|A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
Titus|3|11|knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
Titus|3|12|When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
Titus|3|13|Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus|3|14|And let our {people} also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus|3|15|All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
