Isaiah|2|5|O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
Isaiah|2|6|For thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled {with customs} from the east, and {are} soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
Isaiah|2|7|And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
Isaiah|2|8|Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
Isaiah|2|9|And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low: therefore forgive them not.
Isaiah|2|10|Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.
Isaiah|2|11|The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
Isaiah|2|12|For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;
Isaiah|2|13|and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
Isaiah|2|14|and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
Isaiah|2|15|and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,
Isaiah|2|16|and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.
Isaiah|2|17|And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
Isaiah|2|18|And the idols shall utterly pass away.
Isaiah|2|19|And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
Isaiah|2|20|In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
Isaiah|2|21|to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
Isaiah|2|22|Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?
Isaiah|3|1|For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;
Isaiah|3|2|the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;
Isaiah|3|3|the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.
Isaiah|3|4|And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
Isaiah|3|5|And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
Isaiah|3|6|When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, {saying}, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;
Isaiah|3|7|in that day shall he lift up {his voice}, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.
Isaiah|3|8|For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
Isaiah|3|9|The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.
Isaiah|3|10|Say ye of the righteous, that {it shall be} well {with him}; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Isaiah|3|11|Woe unto the wicked! {it shall be} ill {with him}; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.
Isaiah|3|12|As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
Isaiah|3|13|Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.
Isaiah|3|14|Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:
Isaiah|3|15|what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|3|16|Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;
Isaiah|3|17|therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.
Isaiah|3|18|In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;
Isaiah|3|19|the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;
Isaiah|3|20|the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;
Isaiah|3|21|the rings, and the nose-jewels;
Isaiah|3|22|the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;
Isaiah|3|23|the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.
Isaiah|3|24|And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.
Isaiah|3|25|Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
Isaiah|3|26|And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.
Isaiah|4|1|And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.
Isaiah|4|2|In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
Isaiah|4|3|And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;
Isaiah|4|4|when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
Isaiah|4|5|And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory {shall be spread} a covering.
Isaiah|4|6|And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.
Isaiah|5|1|Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
Isaiah|5|2|and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
Isaiah|5|3|And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
Isaiah|5|4|What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
Isaiah|5|5|And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
Isaiah|5|6|and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
Isaiah|5|7|For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.
Isaiah|5|8|Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
Isaiah|5|9|In mine ears {saith} Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
Isaiah|5|10|For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield {but} an ephah.
Isaiah|5|11|Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!
Isaiah|5|12|And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are {in} their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
Isaiah|5|13|Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
Isaiah|5|14|Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend {into it}.
Isaiah|5|15|And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:
Isaiah|5|16|but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
Isaiah|5|17|Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.
Isaiah|5|18|Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;
Isaiah|5|19|that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
Isaiah|5|20|Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
Isaiah|5|21|Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Isaiah|5|22|Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;
Isaiah|5|23|that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
Isaiah|5|24|Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|5|25|Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|5|26|And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
Isaiah|5|27|None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Isaiah|5|28|whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:
Isaiah|5|29|their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.
Isaiah|5|30|And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness {and} distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.
Isaiah|6|1|In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
Isaiah|6|2|Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
Isaiah|6|3|And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
Isaiah|6|4|And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Isaiah|6|5|Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|6|6|Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
Isaiah|6|7|and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.
Isaiah|6|8|And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
Isaiah|6|9|And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
Isaiah|6|10|Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
Isaiah|6|11|Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,
Isaiah|6|12|and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
Isaiah|6|13|And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
Isaiah|7|1|And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
Isaiah|7|2|And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
Isaiah|7|3|Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;
Isaiah|7|4|and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah|7|5|Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,
Isaiah|7|6|Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;
Isaiah|7|7|thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
