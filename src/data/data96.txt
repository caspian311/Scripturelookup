Lamentations|3|40|Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.
Lamentations|3|41|Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
Lamentations|3|42|We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.
Lamentations|3|43|Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
Lamentations|3|44|Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
Lamentations|3|45|Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
Lamentations|3|46|All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
Lamentations|3|47|Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.
Lamentations|3|48|Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations|3|49|Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
Lamentations|3|50|Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.
Lamentations|3|51|Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
Lamentations|3|52|They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.
Lamentations|3|53|They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.
Lamentations|3|54|Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
Lamentations|3|55|I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.
Lamentations|3|56|Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
Lamentations|3|57|Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.
Lamentations|3|58|O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
Lamentations|3|59|O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.
Lamentations|3|60|Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
Lamentations|3|61|Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,
Lamentations|3|62|The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
Lamentations|3|63|Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
Lamentations|3|64|Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
Lamentations|3|65|Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.
Lamentations|3|66|Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.
Lamentations|4|1|How is the gold become dim! {how} is the most pure gold changed!                   The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
Lamentations|4|2|The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,                   How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
Lamentations|4|3|Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones:                   The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
Lamentations|4|4|The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:                   The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
Lamentations|4|5|They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:                   They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
Lamentations|4|6|For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,                   That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.
Lamentations|4|7|Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;                   They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.
Lamentations|4|8|Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:                   Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
Lamentations|4|9|They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger;                   For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.
Lamentations|4|10|The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;                   They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Lamentations|4|11|Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger;                   And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.
Lamentations|4|12|The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world,                   That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
Lamentations|4|13|{It is} because of the sins of her prophets, {and} the iniquities of her priests,                   That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
Lamentations|4|14|They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood,                   So that men cannot touch their garments.
Lamentations|4|15|Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not!                   When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn {here}.
Lamentations|4|16|The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them:                   They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
Lamentations|4|17|Our eyes do yet fail {in looking} for our vain help:                   In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
Lamentations|4|18|They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets:                   Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
Lamentations|4|19|Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens:                   They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
Lamentations|4|20|The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits;                   Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
Lamentations|4|21|Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz:                   The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
Lamentations|4|22|The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity:                   He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.
Lamentations|5|1|Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us:                   Behold, and see our reproach.
Lamentations|5|2|Our inheritance is turned unto strangers,                   Our houses unto aliens.
Lamentations|5|3|We are orphans and fatherless;                   Our mothers are as widows.
Lamentations|5|4|We have drunken our water for money;                   Our wood is sold unto us.
Lamentations|5|5|Our pursuers are upon our necks:                   We are weary, and have no rest.
Lamentations|5|6|We have given the hand to the Egyptians,                   And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
Lamentations|5|7|Our fathers sinned, and are not;                   And we have borne their iniquities.
Lamentations|5|8|Servants rule over us:                   There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
Lamentations|5|9|We get our bread at the peril of our lives,                   Because of the sword of the wilderness.
Lamentations|5|10|Our skin is black like an oven,                   Because of the burning heat of famine.
Lamentations|5|11|They ravished the women in Zion,                   The virgins in the cities of Judah.
Lamentations|5|12|Princes were hanged up by their hand:                   The faces of elders were not honored.
Lamentations|5|13|The young men bare the mill;                   And the children stumbled under the wood.
Lamentations|5|14|The elders have ceased from the gate,                   The young men from their music.
Lamentations|5|15|The joy of our heart is ceased;                   Our dance is turned into mourning.
Lamentations|5|16|The crown is fallen from our head:                   Woe unto us! for we have sinned.
Lamentations|5|17|For this our heart is faint;                   For these things our eyes are dim;
Lamentations|5|18|For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate:                   The foxes walk upon it.
Lamentations|5|19|Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever;                   Thy throne is from generation to generation.
Lamentations|5|20|Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,                           {And} forsake us so long time?
Lamentations|5|21|Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned;                   Renew our days as of old.
Lamentations|5|22|But thou hast utterly rejected us;                   Thou art very wroth against us.
Proverbs|1|1|The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs|1|2|To know wisdom and instruction;                   To discern the words of understanding;
Proverbs|1|3|To receive instruction in wise dealing,                   In righteousness and justice and equity;
Proverbs|1|4|To give prudence to the simple,                   To the young man knowledge and discretion:
Proverbs|1|5|That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;                   And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:
Proverbs|1|6|To understand a proverb, and a figure,                   The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Proverbs|1|7|The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge;                           {But} the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs|1|8|My son, hear the instruction of thy father,                   And forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs|1|9|For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,                   And chains about thy neck.
Proverbs|1|10|My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.
Proverbs|1|11|If they say, Come with us,                   Let us lay wait for blood;                   Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;
Proverbs|1|12|Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,                   And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
Proverbs|1|13|We shall find all precious substance;                   We shall fill our houses with spoil;
Proverbs|1|14|Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;                   We will all have one purse:
Proverbs|1|15|My son, walk not thou in the way with them;                   Refrain thy foot from their path:
Proverbs|1|16|For their feet run to evil,                   And they make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs|1|17|For in vain is the net spread                   In the sight of any bird:
Proverbs|1|18|And these lay wait for their own blood;                   They lurk privily for their own lives.
Proverbs|1|19|So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;                   It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Proverbs|1|20|Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;                   She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
Proverbs|1|21|She crieth in the chief place of concourse;                   At the entrance of the gates,                   In the city, she uttereth her words:
Proverbs|1|22|How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?                   And scoffers delight them in scoffing,                   And fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs|1|23|Turn you at my reproof:                   Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;                   I will make known my words unto you.
Proverbs|1|24|Because I have called, and ye have refused;                   I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;
Proverbs|1|25|But ye have set at nought all my counsel,                   And would none of my reproof:
Proverbs|1|26|I also will laugh in {the day of} your calamity;                   I will mock when your fear cometh;
Proverbs|1|27|When your fear cometh as a storm,                   And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;                   When distress and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs|1|28|Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer;                   They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:
Proverbs|1|29|For that they hated knowledge,                   And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:
