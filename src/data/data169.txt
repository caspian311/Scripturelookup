Genesis|30|13|And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.
Genesis|30|14|And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|15|And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|16|And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
Genesis|30|17|And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
Genesis|30|18|And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
Genesis|30|19|And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis|30|20|And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
Genesis|30|21|And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
Genesis|30|22|And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
Genesis|30|23|And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
Genesis|30|24|and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.
Genesis|30|25|And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis|30|26|Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.
Genesis|30|27|And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, {tarry}: {for} I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.
Genesis|30|28|And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
Genesis|30|29|And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
Genesis|30|30|For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
Genesis|30|31|And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
Genesis|30|32|I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and {of such} shall be my hire.
Genesis|30|33|So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that {if found} with me, shall be counted stolen.
Genesis|30|34|And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
Genesis|30|35|And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
Genesis|30|36|and he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
Genesis|30|37|And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
Genesis|30|38|And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
Genesis|30|39|And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis|30|40|And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.
Genesis|30|41|And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
Genesis|30|42|but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
Genesis|30|43|And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.
Genesis|31|1|And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.
Genesis|31|2|And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
Genesis|31|3|And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
Genesis|31|4|And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
Genesis|31|5|and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Genesis|31|6|And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis|31|7|And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Genesis|31|8|If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
Genesis|31|9|Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
Genesis|31|10|And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
Genesis|31|11|And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
Genesis|31|12|And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Genesis|31|13|I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
Genesis|31|14|And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Genesis|31|15|Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
Genesis|31|16|For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
Genesis|31|17|Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
Genesis|31|18|and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
Genesis|31|19|Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.
Genesis|31|20|And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
Genesis|31|21|So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|22|And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Genesis|31|23|And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|24|And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|25|And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|26|And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
Genesis|31|27|Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
Genesis|31|28|and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
Genesis|31|29|It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|30|And now, {though} thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, {yet} wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
Genesis|31|31|And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
Genesis|31|32|With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis|31|33|And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
Genesis|31|34|Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
Genesis|31|35|And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
Genesis|31|36|And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Genesis|31|37|Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
Genesis|31|38|These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
Genesis|31|39|That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis|31|40|Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
Genesis|31|41|These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Genesis|31|42|Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
Genesis|31|43|And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?
Genesis|31|44|And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
Genesis|31|45|And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Genesis|31|46|And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
Genesis|31|47|And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis|31|48|And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
Genesis|31|49|and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
Genesis|31|50|If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|51|And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|52|This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Genesis|31|53|The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis|31|54|And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
Genesis|31|55|And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place.
Genesis|32|1|And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Genesis|32|2|And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Genesis|32|3|And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Genesis|32|4|And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
Genesis|32|5|and I have oxen, and asses, {and} flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
Genesis|32|6|And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Genesis|32|7|Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
Genesis|32|8|and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
Genesis|32|9|And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
Genesis|32|10|I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
Genesis|32|11|Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
Genesis|32|12|And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Genesis|32|13|And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
Genesis|32|14|two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
