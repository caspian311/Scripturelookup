Ezekiel|29|2|Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;
Ezekiel|29|3|speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.
Ezekiel|29|4|And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.
Ezekiel|29|5|And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.
Ezekiel|29|6|And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|29|7|When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
Ezekiel|29|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.
Ezekiel|29|9|And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;
Ezekiel|29|10|therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.
Ezekiel|29|11|No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
Ezekiel|29|12|And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|29|13|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;
Ezekiel|29|14|and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
Ezekiel|29|15|It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
Ezekiel|29|16|And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|17|And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|29|18|Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
Ezekiel|29|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
Ezekiel|29|20|I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|21|In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|2|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!
Ezekiel|30|3|For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
Ezekiel|30|4|And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
Ezekiel|30|5|Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
Ezekiel|30|6|Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|7|And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
Ezekiel|30|8|And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.
Ezekiel|30|9|In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.
Ezekiel|30|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel|30|11|He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
Ezekiel|30|12|And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|30|13|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|14|And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.
Ezekiel|30|15|And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
Ezekiel|30|16|And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis {shall have} adversaries in the day-time.
Ezekiel|30|17|The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these {cities} shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|18|At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|19|Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|20|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {month}, in the seventh {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|21|Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply {healing} medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
Ezekiel|30|22|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong {arm}, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
Ezekiel|30|23|And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|30|24|And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
Ezekiel|30|25|And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|26|And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|31|1|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third {month}, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|31|2|Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
Ezekiel|31|3|Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.
Ezekiel|31|4|The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.
Ezekiel|31|5|Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot {them} forth.
Ezekiel|31|6|All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
Ezekiel|31|7|Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.
Ezekiel|31|8|The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.
Ezekiel|31|9|I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
Ezekiel|31|10|Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
Ezekiel|31|11|I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.
Ezekiel|31|12|And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
Ezekiel|31|13|Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;
Ezekiel|31|14|to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, {even} all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|31|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
Ezekiel|31|16|I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
Ezekiel|31|17|They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, {that} dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
Ezekiel|31|18|To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|1|And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|2|Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.
Ezekiel|32|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.
Ezekiel|32|4|And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
Ezekiel|32|5|And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.
Ezekiel|32|6|I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.
Ezekiel|32|7|And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
Ezekiel|32|8|All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|9|I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
Ezekiel|32|10|Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
Ezekiel|32|11|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
Ezekiel|32|12|By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
Ezekiel|32|13|I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
Ezekiel|32|14|Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|15|When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|16|This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|17|It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|18|Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
Ezekiel|32|19|Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
Ezekiel|32|20|They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.
Ezekiel|32|21|The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|22|Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
Ezekiel|32|23|whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|24|There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|25|They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.
Ezekiel|32|26|There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|27|And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for {they were} the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|28|But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|29|There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|30|There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|31|Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|32|For I have put his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|33|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|33|2|Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
Ezekiel|33|3|if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
Ezekiel|33|4|then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
