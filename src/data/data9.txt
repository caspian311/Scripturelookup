Matthew|21|10|And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?
Matthew|21|11|And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew|21|12|And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Matthew|21|13|and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.
Matthew|21|14|And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew|21|15|But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,
Matthew|21|16|and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?
Matthew|21|17|And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
Matthew|21|18|Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.
Matthew|21|19|And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
Matthew|21|20|And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
Matthew|21|21|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.
Matthew|21|22|And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
Matthew|21|23|And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew|21|24|And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|25|The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
Matthew|21|26|But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew|21|27|And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|28|But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.
Matthew|21|29|And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.
Matthew|21|30|And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I {go}, sir: and went not.
Matthew|21|31|Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew|21|32|For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.
Matthew|21|33|Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Matthew|21|34|And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.
Matthew|21|35|And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew|21|36|Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.
Matthew|21|37|But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew|21|38|But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.
Matthew|21|39|And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
Matthew|21|40|When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Matthew|21|41|They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew|21|42|Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner;                   This was from the Lord,                   And it is marvelous in our eyes?
Matthew|21|43|Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Matthew|21|44|And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Matthew|21|45|And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Matthew|21|46|And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.
Matthew|22|1|And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,
Matthew|22|2|The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
Matthew|22|3|and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
Matthew|22|4|Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|5|But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;
Matthew|22|6|and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
Matthew|22|7|But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
Matthew|22|8|Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.
Matthew|22|9|Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|10|And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
Matthew|22|11|But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:
Matthew|22|12|and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
Matthew|22|13|Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|22|14|For many are called, but few chosen.
Matthew|22|15|Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in {his} talk.
Matthew|22|16|And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Matthew|22|17|Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Matthew|22|18|But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?
Matthew|22|19|Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.
Matthew|22|20|And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Matthew|22|21|They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
Matthew|22|22|And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.
Matthew|22|23|On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,
Matthew|22|24|saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew|22|25|Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;
Matthew|22|26|in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Matthew|22|27|And after them all, the woman died.
Matthew|22|28|In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Matthew|22|29|But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Matthew|22|30|For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
Matthew|22|31|But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Matthew|22|32|I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not {the God} of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew|22|33|And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
Matthew|22|34|But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.
Matthew|22|35|And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:
Matthew|22|36|Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew|22|37|And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matthew|22|38|This is the great and first commandment.
Matthew|22|39|And a second like {unto it} is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|22|40|On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.
Matthew|22|41|Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
Matthew|22|42|saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, {The son} of David.
Matthew|22|43|He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
Matthew|22|44|The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?
Matthew|22|45|If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
Matthew|22|46|And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
Matthew|23|1|Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples,
Matthew|23|2|saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses seat:
Matthew|23|3|all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, {these} do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.
Matthew|23|4|Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.
Matthew|23|5|But all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders {of their garments},
Matthew|23|6|and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew|23|7|and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
Matthew|23|8|But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren.
Matthew|23|9|And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, {even} he who is in heaven.
Matthew|23|10|Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, {even} the Christ.
Matthew|23|11|But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew|23|12|And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Matthew|23|13|But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter{.}
Matthew|23|14|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, even while for a pretence ye make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.
Matthew|23|15|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
Matthew|23|16|Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
Matthew|23|17|Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?
