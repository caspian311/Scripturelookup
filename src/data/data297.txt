1 Samuel|16|14|Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
1 Samuel|16|15|And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
1 Samuel|16|16|Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
1 Samuel|16|17|And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
1 Samuel|16|18|Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.
1 Samuel|16|19|Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
1 Samuel|16|20|And Jesse took an ass {laden} with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
1 Samuel|16|21|And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.
1 Samuel|16|22|And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
1 Samuel|16|23|And it came to pass, when the {evil} spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1 Samuel|17|1|Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
1 Samuel|17|2|And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
1 Samuel|17|3|And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
1 Samuel|17|4|And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
1 Samuel|17|5|And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
1 Samuel|17|6|And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
1 Samuel|17|7|And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head {weighed} six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.
1 Samuel|17|8|And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
1 Samuel|17|9|If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
1 Samuel|17|10|And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
1 Samuel|17|11|And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1 Samuel|17|12|Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken {in years} among men.
1 Samuel|17|13|And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1 Samuel|17|14|And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel|17|15|Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.
1 Samuel|17|16|And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1 Samuel|17|17|And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry {them} quickly to the camp to thy brethren;
1 Samuel|17|18|and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
1 Samuel|17|19|Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
1 Samuel|17|20|And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
1 Samuel|17|21|And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
1 Samuel|17|22|And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
1 Samuel|17|23|And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
1 Samuel|17|24|And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
1 Samuel|17|25|And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.
1 Samuel|17|26|And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1 Samuel|17|27|And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
1 Samuel|17|28|And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
1 Samuel|17|29|And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1 Samuel|17|30|And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1 Samuel|17|31|And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
1 Samuel|17|32|And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|33|And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
1 Samuel|17|34|And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,
1 Samuel|17|35|I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
1 Samuel|17|36|Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
1 Samuel|17|37|And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
1 Samuel|17|38|And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel|17|39|And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
1 Samuel|17|40|And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|41|And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
1 Samuel|17|42|And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.
1 Samuel|17|43|And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1 Samuel|17|44|And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
1 Samuel|17|45|Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
1 Samuel|17|46|This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
1 Samuel|17|47|and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand.
1 Samuel|17|48|And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|49|And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.
1 Samuel|17|50|So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1 Samuel|17|51|Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
1 Samuel|17|52|And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
1 Samuel|17|53|And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
1 Samuel|17|54|And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
1 Samuel|17|55|And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
1 Samuel|17|56|And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1 Samuel|17|57|And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1 Samuel|17|58|And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.
1 Samuel|18|1|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|2|And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.
1 Samuel|18|3|Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|4|And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
1 Samuel|18|5|And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, {and} behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
1 Samuel|18|6|And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.
1 Samuel|18|7|And the women sang one to another as they played, and said,             Saul hath slain his thousands,                   And David his ten thousands.
1 Samuel|18|8|And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1 Samuel|18|9|And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Samuel|18|10|And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;
1 Samuel|18|11|and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1 Samuel|18|12|And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.
1 Samuel|18|13|Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel|18|14|And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.
1 Samuel|18|15|And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
1 Samuel|18|16|But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
1 Samuel|18|17|And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
1 Samuel|18|18|And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, {or} my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
1 Samuel|18|19|But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
1 Samuel|18|20|And Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1 Samuel|18|21|And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.
1 Samuel|18|22|And Saul commanded his servants, {saying}, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.
1 Samuel|18|23|And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
1 Samuel|18|24|And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
1 Samuel|18|25|And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|18|26|And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;
1 Samuel|18|27|and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
1 Samuel|18|28|And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
1 Samuel|18|29|And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel|18|30|Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
1 Samuel|19|1|And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.
1 Samuel|19|2|And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
