Leviticus|24|23|And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|25|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus|25|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|25|3|Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;
Leviticus|25|4|but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Leviticus|25|5|That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Leviticus|25|6|And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.
Leviticus|25|7|And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
Leviticus|25|8|And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.
Leviticus|25|9|Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus|25|10|And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Leviticus|25|11|A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather {the grapes} in it of the undressed vines.
Leviticus|25|12|For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus|25|13|In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|14|And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus|25|15|According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, {and} according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|16|According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|17|And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|25|18|Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus|25|19|And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Leviticus|25|20|And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;
Leviticus|25|21|then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
Leviticus|25|22|And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.
Leviticus|25|23|And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus|25|24|And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus|25|25|If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.
Leviticus|25|26|And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
Leviticus|25|27|then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|28|But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|29|And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.
Leviticus|25|30|And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|31|But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|32|Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Leviticus|25|33|And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Leviticus|25|34|But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus|25|35|And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: {as} a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
Leviticus|25|36|Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Leviticus|25|37|Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
Leviticus|25|38|I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, {and} to be your God.
Leviticus|25|39|And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant.
Leviticus|25|40|As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:
Leviticus|25|41|then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Leviticus|25|42|For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus|25|43|Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus|25|44|And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus|25|45|Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus|25|46|And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.
Leviticus|25|47|And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger {or} sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family;
Leviticus|25|48|after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;
Leviticus|25|49|or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus|25|50|And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
Leviticus|25|51|If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Leviticus|25|52|And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
Leviticus|25|53|As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
Leviticus|25|54|And if he be not redeemed by these {means}, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.
Leviticus|25|55|For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|26|1|Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|26|2|Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|26|3|If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus|26|4|then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Leviticus|26|5|And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
Leviticus|26|6|And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
Leviticus|26|7|And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|8|And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|9|And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
Leviticus|26|10|And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.
Leviticus|26|11|And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus|26|12|And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
Leviticus|26|13|I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
Leviticus|26|14|But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
Leviticus|26|15|and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;
Leviticus|26|16|I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus|26|17|And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
Leviticus|26|18|And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus|26|19|And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;
Leviticus|26|20|and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
Leviticus|26|21|And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus|26|22|And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
Leviticus|26|23|And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|24|then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|25|And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus|26|26|When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
Leviticus|26|27|And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|28|then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|29|And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
Leviticus|26|30|And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus|26|31|And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
Leviticus|26|32|And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus|26|33|And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Leviticus|26|34|Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus|26|35|As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
Leviticus|26|36|And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
Leviticus|26|37|And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus|26|38|And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus|26|39|And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus|26|40|And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,
Leviticus|26|41|I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
Leviticus|26|42|then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
Leviticus|26|43|The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Leviticus|26|44|And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;
