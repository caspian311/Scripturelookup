Acts|15|40|but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
Acts|15|41|And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Acts|16|1|And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|2|The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts|16|3|Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|4|And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.
Acts|16|5|So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Acts|16|6|And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
Acts|16|7|and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;
Acts|16|8|and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts|16|9|And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Acts|16|10|And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts|16|11|Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
Acts|16|12|and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a {Roman} colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.
Acts|16|13|And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.
Acts|16|14|And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts|16|15|And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide {there}. And she constrained us.
Acts|16|16|And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
Acts|16|17|The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.
Acts|16|18|And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
Acts|16|19|But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,
Acts|16|20|and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Acts|16|21|and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.
Acts|16|22|And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.
Acts|16|23|And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Acts|16|24|who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Acts|16|25|But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
Acts|16|26|and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
Acts|16|27|And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts|16|28|But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Acts|16|29|And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,
Acts|16|30|and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts|16|31|And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
Acts|16|32|And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.
Acts|16|33|And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.
Acts|16|34|And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.
Acts|16|35|But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
Acts|16|36|And the jailor reported the words to Paul, {saying}, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.
Acts|16|37|But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.
Acts|16|38|And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;
Acts|16|39|and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.
Acts|16|40|And they went out of the prison, and entered into {the house} of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
Acts|17|1|Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Acts|17|2|and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts|17|3|opening and alleging that it behooved the Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom, {said he,} I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.
Acts|17|4|And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Acts|17|5|But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.
Acts|17|6|And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Acts|17|7|whom Jason hath received: and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, {one} Jesus.
Acts|17|8|And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Acts|17|9|And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Acts|17|10|And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts|17|11|Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
Acts|17|12|Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.
Acts|17|13|But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.
Acts|17|14|And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.
Acts|17|15|But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
Acts|17|16|Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.
Acts|17|17|So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.
Acts|17|18|And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts|17|19|And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?
Acts|17|20|For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Acts|17|21|(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
Acts|17|22|And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.
Acts|17|23|For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.
Acts|17|24|The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Acts|17|25|neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Acts|17|26|and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined {their} appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;
Acts|17|27|that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:
Acts|17|28|for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Acts|17|29|Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.
Acts|17|30|The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:
Acts|17|31|inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Acts|17|32|Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.
Acts|17|33|Thus Paul went out from among them.
Acts|17|34|But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
Acts|18|1|After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
Acts|18|2|And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;
Acts|18|3|and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers.
Acts|18|4|And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
Acts|18|5|But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|18|6|And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook out his raiment and said unto them, Your blood {be} upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
Acts|18|7|And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Acts|18|8|And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
Acts|18|9|And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:
Acts|18|10|for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.
Acts|18|11|And he dwelt {there} a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Acts|18|12|But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,
Acts|18|13|saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts|18|14|But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
Acts|18|15|but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.
Acts|18|16|And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
Acts|18|17|And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
Acts|18|18|And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.
Acts|18|19|And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts|18|20|And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;
Acts|18|21|but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.
Acts|18|22|And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.
Acts|18|23|And having spent some time {there}, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.
Acts|18|24|Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.
