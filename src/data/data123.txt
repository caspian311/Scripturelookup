Joshua|18|21|Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,

Joshua|19|9|Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
Joshua|19|10|And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;
Joshua|19|11|and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
Joshua|19|12|and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;

Joshua|19|25|And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
Joshua|19|26|and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
Joshua|19|27|and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
Joshua|19|28|and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Sidon;
Joshua|19|29|and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;

Joshua|19|31|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|32|The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.

Joshua|19|34|and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|19|35|And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
Joshua|19|36|and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

Joshua|19|47|And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua|19|48|This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|49|So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
Joshua|19|50|according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
Joshua|19|51|These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
Joshua|20|1|And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|20|2|Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,
Joshua|20|3|that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly {and} unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua|20|4|And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
Joshua|20|5|And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
Joshua|20|6|And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
Joshua|20|7|And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah.
Joshua|20|8|And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|20|9|These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person unwittingly might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
Joshua|21|1|Then came near the heads of fathers’ {houses} of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of fathers’ {houses} of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua|21|2|and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
Joshua|21|3|And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|4|And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

Joshua|21|9|And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are {here} mentioned by name:
Joshua|21|10|and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
Joshua|21|11|And they gave them Kiriath-arba, {which Arba was} the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
Joshua|21|12|But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
Joshua|21|13|And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,

Joshua|21|15|and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
