Daniel|5|23|but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.
Daniel|5|24|Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
Daniel|5|25|And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
Daniel|5|26|This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;
Daniel|5|27|TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
Daniel|5|28|PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
Daniel|5|29|Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|30|In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
Daniel|5|31|And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
Daniel|6|1|It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;
Daniel|6|2|and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.
Daniel|6|3|Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
Daniel|6|4|Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
Daniel|6|5|Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
Daniel|6|6|Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
Daniel|6|7|All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel|6|8|Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|9|Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
Daniel|6|10|And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
Daniel|6|11|Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel|6|12|Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|13|Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
Daniel|6|14|Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.
Daniel|6|15|Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
Daniel|6|16|Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. {Now} the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
Daniel|6|17|And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
Daniel|6|18|Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.
Daniel|6|19|Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
Daniel|6|20|And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
Daniel|6|21|Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel|6|22|My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Daniel|6|23|Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel|6|24|And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
Daniel|6|25|Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
Daniel|6|26|I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
Daniel|6|27|He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
Daniel|6|28|So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
Daniel|7|1|In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
Daniel|7|2|Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.
Daniel|7|3|And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
Daniel|7|4|The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.
Daniel|7|5|And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
Daniel|7|6|After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
Daniel|7|7|After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
Daniel|7|8|I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
Daniel|7|9|I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, {and} the wheels thereof burning fire.
Daniel|7|10|A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
Daniel|7|11|I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
Daniel|7|12|And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
Daniel|7|13|I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
Daniel|7|14|And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
Daniel|7|15|As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
Daniel|7|16|I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
Daniel|7|17|These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.
Daniel|7|18|But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
Daniel|7|19|Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
Daniel|7|20|and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other {horn} which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.
Daniel|7|21|I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
Daniel|7|22|until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
Daniel|7|23|Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
Daniel|7|24|And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
Daniel|7|25|And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
Daniel|7|26|But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
Daniel|7|27|And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
Daniel|7|28|Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
Daniel|8|1|In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
Daniel|8|2|And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
Daniel|8|3|Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
Daniel|8|4|I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
Daniel|8|5|And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
Daniel|8|6|And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.
Daniel|8|7|And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
Daniel|8|8|And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable {horns} toward the four winds of heaven.
Daniel|8|9|And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious {land}.
Daniel|8|10|And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
Daniel|8|11|Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual {burnt-offering}, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
Daniel|8|12|And the host was given over {to it} together with the continual {burnt-offering} through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did {its pleasure} and prospered.
Daniel|8|13|Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision {concerning} the continual {burnt-offering}, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
Daniel|8|14|And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings {and} mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
Daniel|8|15|And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
Daniel|8|16|And I heard a man’s voice between {the banks of} the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
Daniel|8|17|So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.
Daniel|8|18|Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
Daniel|8|19|And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.
Daniel|8|20|The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel|8|21|And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel|8|22|And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
Daniel|8|23|And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
Daniel|8|24|And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do {his pleasure}; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.
Daniel|8|25|And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in {their} security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
Daniel|8|26|And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days {to come}.
Daniel|8|27|And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.
Daniel|9|1|In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,
Daniel|9|2|in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.
Daniel|9|3|And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel|9|4|And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,
Daniel|9|5|we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;
Daniel|9|6|neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
Daniel|9|7|O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
Daniel|9|8|O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
