1 Corinthians|15|41|There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
1 Corinthians|15|42|So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians|15|43|it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians|15|44|it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual {body}.
1 Corinthians|15|45|So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam {became} a life-giving spirit.
1 Corinthians|15|46|Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians|15|47|The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.
1 Corinthians|15|48|As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|49|And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|50|Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians|15|51|Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians|15|52|in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians|15|53|For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1 Corinthians|15|54|But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians|15|55|O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?
1 Corinthians|15|56|The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:
1 Corinthians|15|57|but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|15|58|Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|16|1|Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
1 Corinthians|16|2|Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
1 Corinthians|16|3|And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:
1 Corinthians|16|4|and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.
1 Corinthians|16|5|But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;
1 Corinthians|16|6|but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.
1 Corinthians|16|7|For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1 Corinthians|16|8|But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;
1 Corinthians|16|9|for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians|16|10|Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:
1 Corinthians|16|11|let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.
1 Corinthians|16|12|But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not all {his} will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.
1 Corinthians|16|13|Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1 Corinthians|16|14|Let all that ye do be done in love.
1 Corinthians|16|15|Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),
1 Corinthians|16|16|that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.
1 Corinthians|16|17|And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.
1 Corinthians|16|18|For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.
1 Corinthians|16|19|The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1 Corinthians|16|20|All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians|16|21|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians|16|22|If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.
1 Corinthians|16|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians|16|24|My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Acts|1|1|The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
Acts|1|2|until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
Acts|1|3|To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:
Acts|1|4|and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, {said he}, ye heard from me:
Acts|1|5|For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
Acts|1|6|They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
Acts|1|7|And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority.
Acts|1|8|But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Acts|1|9|And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
Acts|1|10|And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
Acts|1|11|who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
Acts|1|12|Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath dayâ€™s journey off.
Acts|1|13|And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James {the son} of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas {the son} of James.
Acts|1|14|These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
Acts|1|15|And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons {gathered} together, about a hundred and twenty),
Acts|1|16|Brethren, it was needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
Acts|1|17|For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.
Acts|1|18|(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
Acts|1|19|And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)
Acts|1|20|For it is written in the book of Psalms,             Let his habitation be made desolate,                   And let no man dwell therein:            and,             His office let another take.
Acts|1|21|Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
Acts|1|22|beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.
Acts|1|23|And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Acts|1|24|And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,
Acts|1|25|to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.
Acts|1|26|And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
Acts|2|1|And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.
Acts|2|2|And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Acts|2|3|And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.
Acts|2|4|And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Acts|2|5|Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
Acts|2|6|And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.
Acts|2|7|And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
Acts|2|8|And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
Acts|2|9|Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
Acts|2|10|in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts|2|11|Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.
Acts|2|12|And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
Acts|2|13|But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.
Acts|2|14|But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, {saying}, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.
Acts|2|15|For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is {but} the third hour of the day.
Acts|2|16|but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel:
Acts|2|17|And it shall be in the last days, saith God,                   I will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh:                   And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,                   And your young men shall see visions,                   And your old men shall dream dreams:
Acts|2|18|Yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days                   Will I pour forth of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
Acts|2|19|And I will show wonders in the heaven above,                   And signs on the earth beneath;                   Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:
Acts|2|20|The sun shall be turned into darkness,                   And the moon into blood,                   Before the day of the Lord come,                   That great and notable {day}.
Acts|2|21|And it shall be, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Acts|2|22|Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;
Acts|2|23|him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:
Acts|2|24|whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
Acts|2|25|For David saith concerning him,             I beheld the Lord always before my face;                   For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
Acts|2|26|Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;                   Moreover my flesh also shall dwell in hope:
Acts|2|27|Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto Hades,                   Neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.
Acts|2|28|Thou madest known unto me the ways of life;                   Thou shalt make me full of gladness with thy countenance.
Acts|2|29|Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.
Acts|2|30|Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set {one} upon his throne;
Acts|2|31|he foreseeing {this} spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts|2|32|This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.
