John|13|31|When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;
John|13|32|and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.
John|13|33|Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.
John|13|34|A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
John|13|35|By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
John|13|36|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.
John|13|37|Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.
John|13|38|Jesus answereth, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.
John|14|1|Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
John|14|2|In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
John|14|3|And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, {there} ye may be also.
John|14|4|And whither I go, ye know the way.
John|14|5|Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?
John|14|6|Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John|14|7|If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
John|14|8|Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
John|14|9|Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
John|14|10|Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.
John|14|11|Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
John|14|12|Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater {works} than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
John|14|13|And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John|14|14|If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
John|14|15|If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.
John|14|16|And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
John|14|17|{even} the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
John|14|18|I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.
John|14|19|Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.
John|14|20|In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
John|14|21|He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.
John|14|22|Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
John|14|23|Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
John|14|24|He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
John|14|25|These things have I spoken unto you, while {yet} abiding with you.
John|14|26|But the Comforter, {even} the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.
John|14|27|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
John|14|28|Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
John|14|29|And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
John|14|30|I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;
John|14|31|but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
John|15|1|I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
John|15|2|Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every {branch} that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.
John|15|3|Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you.
John|15|4|Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
John|15|5|I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.
John|15|6|If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
John|15|7|If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
John|15|8|Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; and {so} shall ye be my disciples.
John|15|9|Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.
John|15|10|If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
John|15|11|These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may be in you, and {that} your joy may be made full.
John|15|12|This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.
John|15|13|Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
John|15|14|Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.
John|15|15|No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.
John|15|16|Ye did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that ye should go and bear fruit, and {that} your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
John|15|17|These things I command you, that ye may love one another.
John|15|18|If the world hateth you, ye know that it hath hated me before {it hated} you.
John|15|19|If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
John|15|20|Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
John|15|21|But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
John|15|22|If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John|15|23|He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
John|15|24|If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
John|15|25|But {this cometh to pass}, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
John|15|26|But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, {even} the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:
John|15|27|and ye also bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.
John|16|1|These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.
John|16|2|They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God.
John|16|3|And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
John|16|4|But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.
John|16|5|But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
John|16|6|But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
John|16|7|Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
John|16|8|And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
John|16|9|of sin, because they believe not on me;
John|16|10|of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;
John|16|11|of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
John|16|12|I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
John|16|13|Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, {these} shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.
John|16|14|He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare {it} unto you.
John|16|15|All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare {it} unto you.
John|16|16|A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.
John|16|17|{Some} of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
John|16|18|They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.
John|16|19|Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
John|16|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
John|16|21|A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.
John|16|22|And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.
John|16|23|And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.
John|16|24|Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
John|16|25|These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.
John|16|26|In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;
John|16|27|for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
John|16|28|I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.
John|16|29|His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.
John|16|30|Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
John|16|31|Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
John|16|32|Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and {yet} I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
John|16|33|These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
John|17|1|These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee:
