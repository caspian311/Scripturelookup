2 Chronicles|25|17|Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Chronicles|25|18|And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Chronicles|25|19|Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten Edom; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2 Chronicles|25|20|But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand {of their enemies}, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles|25|21|So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Chronicles|25|22|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Chronicles|25|23|And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Chronicles|25|24|And {he took} all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|25|25|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Chronicles|25|26|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
2 Chronicles|25|27|Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Chronicles|25|28|And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.

2 Chronicles|26|3|Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|26|4|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles|26|5|And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.

2 Chronicles|26|10|And he built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for he had much cattle; in the lowland also, and in the plain: {and he had} husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.
2 Chronicles|26|11|Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.
2 Chronicles|26|12|The whole number of the heads of fathers’ {houses}, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.

2 Chronicles|26|15|And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
2 Chronicles|26|16|But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|17|And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:
2 Chronicles|26|18|and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.
2 Chronicles|26|19|Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|20|And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.
2 Chronicles|26|21|And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
2 Chronicles|26|22|Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
2 Chronicles|26|23|So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|27|1|Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles|27|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly.
2 Chronicles|27|3|He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
2 Chronicles|27|4|Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
2 Chronicles|27|5|He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third.
2 Chronicles|27|6|So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|27|7|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles|27|8|He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|27|9|And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|28|1|Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;
2 Chronicles|28|2|but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.
2 Chronicles|28|3|Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|4|And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles|28|5|Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
2 Chronicles|28|6|For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.

2 Chronicles|28|9|But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven.
2 Chronicles|28|10|And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: {but} are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?
2 Chronicles|28|11|Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
2 Chronicles|28|12|Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
2 Chronicles|28|13|and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|14|So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|28|15|And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|28|16|At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
2 Chronicles|28|17|For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
2 Chronicles|28|18|The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.
2 Chronicles|28|19|For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|28|20|And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
2 Chronicles|28|21|For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.
2 Chronicles|28|22|And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.
2 Chronicles|28|23|For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, {therefore} will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|24|And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|28|25|And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|28|26|Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|27|And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|29|1|Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles|29|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
2 Chronicles|29|3|He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.
2 Chronicles|29|4|And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
2 Chronicles|29|5|and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
2 Chronicles|29|6|For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.
2 Chronicles|29|7|Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|8|Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
2 Chronicles|29|9|For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
2 Chronicles|29|10|Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
2 Chronicles|29|11|My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.
2 Chronicles|29|12|Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
2 Chronicles|29|13|and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2 Chronicles|29|14|and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2 Chronicles|29|15|And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|16|And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|29|17|Now they began on the first {day} of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
2 Chronicles|29|18|Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within {the palace}, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|29|19|Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|20|Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|21|And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|22|So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
2 Chronicles|29|23|And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:
2 Chronicles|29|24|and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded {that} the burnt-offering and the sin-offering {should be made} for all Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|25|And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.
2 Chronicles|29|26|And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles|29|27|And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|28|And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this {continued} until the burnt-offering was finished.
2 Chronicles|29|29|And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
