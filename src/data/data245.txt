Job|12|15|Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;                   Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
Job|12|16|With him is strength and wisdom;                   The deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job|12|17|He leadeth counsellors away stripped,                   And judges maketh he fools.
Job|12|18|He looseth the bond of kings,                   And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.
Job|12|19|He leadeth priests away stripped,                   And overthroweth the mighty.
Job|12|20|He removeth the speech of the trusty,                   And taketh away the understanding of the elders.
Job|12|21|He poureth contempt upon princes,                   And looseth the belt of the strong.
Job|12|22|He uncovereth deep things out of darkness,                    And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
Job|12|23|He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them:                   He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.
Job|12|24|He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,                   And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
Job|12|25|They grope in the dark without light;                   And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
Job|13|1|Lo, mine eye hath seen all {this},                   Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
Job|13|2|What ye know, {the same} do I know also:                   I am not inferior unto you.
Job|13|3|Surely I would speak to the Almighty,                   And I desire to reason with God.
Job|13|4|But ye are forgers of lies;                   Ye are all physicians of no value.
Job|13|5|Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!                   And it would be your wisdom.
Job|13|6|Hear now my reasoning,                   And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
Job|13|7|Will ye speak unrighteously for God,                   And talk deceitfully for him?
Job|13|8|Will ye show partiality to him?                   Will ye contend for God?
Job|13|9|Is it good that he should search you out?                   Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?
Job|13|10|He will surely reprove you                   If ye do secretly show partiality.
Job|13|11|Shall not his majesty make you afraid,                   And his dread fall upon you?
Job|13|12|Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,                   Your defences are defences of clay.
Job|13|13|Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak;                   And let come on me what will.
Job|13|14|Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth,                   And put my life in my hand?
Job|13|15|Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope:                   Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.
Job|13|16|This also shall be my salvation,                   That a godless man shall not come before him.
Job|13|17|Hear diligently my speech,                   And let my declaration be in your ears.
Job|13|18|Behold now, I have set my cause in order;                   I know that I am righteous.
Job|13|19|Who is he that will contend with me?                   For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
Job|13|20|Only do not two things unto me;                   Then will I not hide myself from thy face:
Job|13|21|Withdraw thy hand far from me;                   And let not thy terror make me afraid.
Job|13|22|Then call thou, and I will answer;                   Or let me speak, and answer thou me.
Job|13|23|How many are mine iniquities and sins?                   Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job|13|24|Wherefore hidest thou thy face,                   And holdest me for thine enemy?
Job|13|25|Wilt thou harass a driven leaf?                   And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job|13|26|For thou writest bitter things against me,                   And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
Job|13|27|Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,                   And markest all my paths;                   Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:
Job|13|28|Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,                   Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Job|14|1|Man, that is born of a woman,                   Is of few days, and full of trouble.
Job|14|2|He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:                   He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
Job|14|3|And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one,                   And bringest me into judgment with thee?
Job|14|4|Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job|14|5|Seeing his days are determined,                   The number of his months is with thee,                   And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
Job|14|6|Look away from him, that he may rest,                   Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
Job|14|7|For there is hope of a tree,                   If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,                   And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
Job|14|8|Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,                   And the stock thereof die in the ground;
Job|14|9|Yet through the scent of water it will bud,                   And put forth boughs like a plant.
Job|14|10|But man dieth, and is laid low:                   Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
Job|14|11|{As} the waters fail from the sea,                   And the river wasteth and drieth up;
Job|14|12|So man lieth down and riseth not:                   Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,                   Nor be roused out of their sleep.
Job|14|13|Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,                   That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,                   That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
Job|14|14|If a man die, shall he live {again}?                   All the days of my warfare would I wait,                   Till my release should come.
Job|14|15|Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee:                   Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.
Job|14|16|But now thou numberest my steps:                   Dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job|14|17|My transgression is sealed up in a bag,                   And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.
Job|14|18|But the mountain falling cometh to nought;                   And the rock is removed out of its place;
Job|14|19|The waters wear the stones;                   The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:                   So thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job|14|20|Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;                   Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Job|14|21|His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not;                   And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
Job|14|22|But his flesh upon him hath pain,                   And his soul within him mourneth.
Job|15|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|15|2|Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge,                   And fill himself with the east wind?
Job|15|3|Should he reason with unprofitable talk,                   Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
Job|15|4|Yea, thou doest away with fear,                   And hinderest devotion before God.
Job|15|5|For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,                   And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
Job|15|6|Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;                   Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
Job|15|7|Art thou the first man that was born?                   Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
Job|15|8|Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God?                   And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?
Job|15|9|What knowest thou, that we know not?                   What understandest thou, which is not in us?
Job|15|10|With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,                   Much elder than thy father.
Job|15|11|Are the consolations of God too small for thee,                   Even the word that is gentle toward thee?
Job|15|12|Why doth thy heart carry thee away?                   And why do thine eyes flash,
Job|15|13|That against God thou turnest thy spirit,                   And lettest words go out of thy mouth?
Job|15|14|What is man, that he should be clean?                   And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
Job|15|15|Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones;                   Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:
Job|15|16|How much less one that is abominable and corrupt,                   A man that drinketh iniquity like water!
Job|15|17|I will show thee, hear thou me;                   And that which I have seen I will declare:
Job|15|18|(Which wise men have told                   From their fathers, and have not hid it;
Job|15|19|Unto whom alone the land was given,                   And no stranger passed among them):
Job|15|20|The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,                   Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
Job|15|21|A sound of terrors is in his ears;                   In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job|15|22|He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,                   And he is waited for of the sword.
Job|15|23|He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where is it?                   He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job|15|24|Distress and anguish make him afraid;                   They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
Job|15|25|Because he hath stretched out his hand against God,                   And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;
Job|15|26|He runneth upon him with a {stiff} neck,                   With the thick bosses of his bucklers;
Job|15|27|Because he hath covered his face with his fatness,                   And gathered fat upon his loins;
Job|15|28|And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,                   In houses which no man inhabited,                   Which were ready to become heaps;
Job|15|29|He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,                   Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
Job|15|30|He shall not depart out of darkness;                   The flame shall dry up his branches,                   And by the breath of {God’s} mouth shall he go away.
Job|15|31|Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;                   For vanity shall be his recompense.
Job|15|32|It shall be accomplished before his time,                   And his branch shall not be green.
Job|15|33|He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,                   And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.
Job|15|34|For the company of the godless shall be barren,                   And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
Job|15|35|They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity,                   And their heart prepareth deceit.
Job|16|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|16|2|I have heard many such things:                   Miserable comforters are ye all.
Job|16|3|Shall vain words have an end?                   Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
Job|16|4|I also could speak as ye do;                   If your soul were in my soul’s stead,                   I could join words together against you,                   And shake my head at you.
