Matthew|15|3|And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Matthew|15|4|For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.
Matthew|15|5|But ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given {to God};
Matthew|15|6|he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.
Matthew|15|7|Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
Matthew|15|8|This people honoreth me with their lips;                   But their heart is far from me.
Matthew|15|9|But in vain do they worship me,                   Teaching {as their} doctrines the precepts of men.
Matthew|15|10|And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
Matthew|15|11|Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.
Matthew|15|12|Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
Matthew|15|13|But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.
Matthew|15|14|Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.
Matthew|15|15|And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.
Matthew|15|16|And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?
Matthew|15|17|Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew|15|18|But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew|15|19|For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:
Matthew|15|20|these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.
Matthew|15|21|And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew|15|22|And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
Matthew|15|23|But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
Matthew|15|24|But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|15|25|But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew|15|26|And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Matthew|15|27|But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
Matthew|15|28|Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
Matthew|15|29|And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
Matthew|15|30|And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:
Matthew|15|31|insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew|15|32|And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.
Matthew|15|33|And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?
Matthew|15|34|And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
Matthew|15|35|And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
Matthew|15|36|and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|15|37|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
Matthew|15|38|And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew|15|39|And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
Matthew|16|1|And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Matthew|16|2|But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, {It will be} fair weather: for the heaven is red.
Matthew|16|3|And in the morning, {It will be} foul weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the heaven; but ye cannot {discern} the signs of the times.
Matthew|16|4|An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
Matthew|16|5|And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.
Matthew|16|6|And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|7|And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread.
Matthew|16|8|And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread?
Matthew|16|9|Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|10|Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|11|How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|12|Then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|13|Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?
Matthew|16|14|And they said, Some {say} John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
Matthew|16|15|He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am?
Matthew|16|16|And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew|16|17|And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|16|18|And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
Matthew|16|19|I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|16|20|Then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.
Matthew|16|21|From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Matthew|16|22|And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee.
Matthew|16|23|But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Matthew|16|24|Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew|16|25|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew|16|26|For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?
Matthew|16|27|For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds.
Matthew|16|28|Verily I say unto you, there are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Matthew|17|1|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
Matthew|17|2|and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
Matthew|17|3|And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
Matthew|17|4|And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Matthew|17|5|While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
Matthew|17|6|And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew|17|7|And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
Matthew|17|8|And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only.
Matthew|17|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead.
Matthew|17|10|And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
Matthew|17|11|And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things:
Matthew|17|12|but I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them.
Matthew|17|13|Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
Matthew|17|14|And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying,
Matthew|17|15|Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and off-times into the water.
Matthew|17|16|And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew|17|17|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
Matthew|17|18|And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.
Matthew|17|19|Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
Matthew|17|20|And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
Matthew|17|21|{But this kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting.}
Matthew|17|22|And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men;
Matthew|17|23|and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.
Matthew|17|24|And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel?
Matthew|17|25|He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?
Matthew|17|26|And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.
Matthew|17|27|But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
Matthew|18|1|In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew|18|2|And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,
Matthew|18|3|and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|4|Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|5|And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:
Matthew|18|6|But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and {that} he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.
Matthew|18|7|Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!
Matthew|18|8|And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
