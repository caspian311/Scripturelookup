Luke|12|35|Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;
Luke|12|36|and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him.
Luke|12|37|Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them.
Luke|12|38|And if he shall come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find {them} so blessed are those {servants}.
Luke|12|39|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through.
Luke|12|40|Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Luke|12|41|And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all?
Luke|12|42|And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?
Luke|12|43|Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Luke|12|44|Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
Luke|12|45|But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
Luke|12|46|the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.
Luke|12|47|And that servant, who knew his lordâ€™s will, and made not ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many {stripes};
Luke|12|48|but he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few {stripes}. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.
Luke|12|49|I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled?
Luke|12|50|But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke|12|51|Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
Luke|12|52|for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
Luke|12|53|They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.
Luke|12|54|And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|55|And when {ye see} a south wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|56|Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?
Luke|12|57|And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
Luke|12|58|For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison.
Luke|12|59|I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.
Luke|13|1|Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke|13|2|And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things?
Luke|13|3|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.
Luke|13|4|Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
Luke|13|5|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Luke|13|6|And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none.
Luke|13|7|And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground?
Luke|13|8|And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
Luke|13|9|and if it bear fruit thenceforth, {well}; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.
Luke|13|10|And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.
Luke|13|11|And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up.
Luke|13|12|And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
Luke|13|13|And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
Luke|13|14|And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.
Luke|13|15|But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
Luke|13|16|And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound, lo, {these} eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?
Luke|13|17|And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke|13|18|He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?
Luke|13|19|It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.
Luke|13|20|And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke|13|21|It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
Luke|13|22|And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.
Luke|13|23|And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them,
Luke|13|24|Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
Luke|13|25|When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;
Luke|13|26|then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;
Luke|13|27|and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
Luke|13|28|There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.
Luke|13|29|And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
Luke|13|30|And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
Luke|13|31|In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.
Luke|13|32|And he said unto them, Go and say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third {day} I am perfected.
Luke|13|33|Nevertheless I must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the {day} following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
Luke|13|34|O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen {gathereth} her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!
Luke|13|35|Behold, your house is left unto you {desolate}: and I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Luke|14|1|And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
Luke|14|2|And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy.
Luke|14|3|And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?
Luke|14|4|But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.
Luke|14|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?
Luke|14|6|And they could not answer again unto these things.
Luke|14|7|And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them,
Luke|14|8|When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him,
Luke|14|9|and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.
Luke|14|10|But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.
Luke|14|11|For everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke|14|12|And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.
Luke|14|13|But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
Luke|14|14|and thou shalt be blessed; because they have not {wherewith} to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.
Luke|14|15|And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke|14|16|But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many:
Luke|14|17|and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for {all} things are now ready.
Luke|14|18|And they all with one {consent} began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|19|And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|20|And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
Luke|14|21|And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.
Luke|14|22|And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.
Luke|14|23|And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain {them} to come in, that my house may be filled.
Luke|14|24|For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.
Luke|14|25|Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them,
Luke|14|26|If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|27|Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|28|For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have {wherewith} to complete it?
Luke|14|29|Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,
Luke|14|30|saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
Luke|14|31|Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
Luke|14|32|Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.
Luke|14|33|So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|34|Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
Luke|14|35|It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill: {men} cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|15|1|Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.
Luke|15|2|And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
Luke|15|3|And he spake unto them this parable, saying,
Luke|15|4|What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
Luke|15|5|And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
