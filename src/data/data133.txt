1 Kings|21|24|Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
1 Kings|21|25|(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
1 Kings|21|26|And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.)
1 Kings|21|27|And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1 Kings|21|28|And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings|21|29|Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.
1 Kings|22|1|And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings|22|2|And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|3|And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1 Kings|22|4|And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
1 Kings|22|5|And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|22|6|Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|7|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
1 Kings|22|8|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
1 Kings|22|9|Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
1 Kings|22|10|Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
1 Kings|22|11|And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
1 Kings|22|12|And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|13|And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets {declare} good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.
1 Kings|22|14|And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.
1 Kings|22|15|And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|16|And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
1 Kings|22|17|And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
1 Kings|22|18|And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
1 Kings|22|19|And {Micaiah} said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
1 Kings|22|20|And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.
1 Kings|22|21|And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
1 Kings|22|22|And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
1 Kings|22|23|Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.
1 Kings|22|24|Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?
1 Kings|22|25|And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1 Kings|22|26|And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
1 Kings|22|27|and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
1 Kings|22|28|And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
1 Kings|22|29|So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1 Kings|22|30|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1 Kings|22|31|Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|32|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
1 Kings|22|33|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1 Kings|22|34|And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
1 Kings|22|35|And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
1 Kings|22|36|And there went a cry throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.
1 Kings|22|37|So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings|22|38|And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves {there}); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.
1 Kings|22|39|Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|22|40|So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|22|41|And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|42|Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1 Kings|22|43|And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1 Kings|22|44|And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|45|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings|22|46|And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.
1 Kings|22|47|And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1 Kings|22|48|Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
1 Kings|22|49|Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1 Kings|22|50|And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|22|51|Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
1 Kings|22|52|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|22|53|And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
Hebrews|1|1|God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,
Hebrews|1|2|hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in {his} Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;
Hebrews|1|3|who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
Hebrews|1|4|having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
Hebrews|1|5|For unto which of the angels said he at any time,             Thou art my Son,                   This day have I begotten thee?            and again,             I will be to him a Father,                   And he shall be to me a Son?
Hebrews|1|6|And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
Hebrews|1|7|And of the angels he saith,             Who maketh his angels winds,                   And his ministers a flame a fire:
Hebrews|1|8|but of the Son {he saith,}             Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;                   And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Hebrews|1|9|Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;                   Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee                   With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Hebrews|1|10|And,             Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth,                   And the heavens are the works of thy hands:
Hebrews|1|11|They shall perish; but thou continuest:                   And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
Hebrews|1|12|And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up,                   As a garment, and they shall be changed:                   But thou art the same,                   And thy years shall not fail.
Hebrews|1|13|But of which of the angels hath he said at any time,             Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
Hebrews|1|14|Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?
Hebrews|2|1|Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away {from them}.
Hebrews|2|2|For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;
Hebrews|2|3|how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;
Hebrews|2|4|God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.
Hebrews|2|5|For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.
Hebrews|2|6|But one hath somewhere testified, saying,             What is man, that thou art mindful of him?                   Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Hebrews|2|7|Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;                   Thou crownedst him with glory and honor,                   And didst set him over the works of thy hands:
Hebrews|2|8|Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet.            For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.
Hebrews|2|9|But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, {even} Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every {man}.
Hebrews|2|10|For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Hebrews|2|11|For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews|2|12|saying,             I will declare thy name unto my brethren,                   In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.
Hebrews|2|13|And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.
Hebrews|2|14|Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
Hebrews|2|15|and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews|2|16|For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews|2|17|Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews|2|18|For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.
Hebrews|3|1|Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, {even} Jesus;
Hebrews|3|2|who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
Hebrews|3|3|For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
Hebrews|3|4|For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
Hebrews|3|5|And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;
Hebrews|3|6|but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
Hebrews|3|7|Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith,             To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
Hebrews|3|8|Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,                   Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
Hebrews|3|9|Where your fathers tried {me} by proving {me,}                   And saw my works forty years.
