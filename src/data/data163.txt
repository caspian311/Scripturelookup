Genesis|10|9|He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
Genesis|10|10|And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Genesis|10|11|Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,
Genesis|10|12|and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
Genesis|10|13|And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
Genesis|10|14|and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
Genesis|10|15|And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
Genesis|10|16|and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
Genesis|10|17|and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
Genesis|10|18|and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
Genesis|10|19|And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
Genesis|10|20|These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
Genesis|10|21|And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
Genesis|10|22|The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
Genesis|10|23|And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
Genesis|10|24|And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
Genesis|10|25|And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother’s name was Joktan.
Genesis|10|26|And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
Genesis|10|27|and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
Genesis|10|28|and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
Genesis|10|29|and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis|10|30|And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
Genesis|10|31|These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
Genesis|10|32|These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Genesis|11|1|And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
Genesis|11|2|And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Genesis|11|3|And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
Genesis|11|4|And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top {may reach} unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis|11|5|And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Genesis|11|6|And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
Genesis|11|7|Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
Genesis|11|8|So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
Genesis|11|9|Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis|11|10|These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Genesis|11|11|and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|12|And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.
Genesis|11|13|and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|14|And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
Genesis|11|15|and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|16|And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
Genesis|11|17|and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|18|And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
Genesis|11|19|and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|20|And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
Genesis|11|21|and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|22|And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
Genesis|11|23|and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|24|And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
Genesis|11|25|and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|11|26|And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Genesis|11|27|Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.
Genesis|11|28|And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis|11|29|And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Genesis|11|30|And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
Genesis|11|31|And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
Genesis|11|32|And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Genesis|12|1|Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee:
Genesis|12|2|and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing;
Genesis|12|3|and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|12|4|So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis|12|5|And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis|12|6|And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis|12|7|And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.
Genesis|12|8|And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|12|9|And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
Genesis|12|10|And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|12|11|And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis|12|12|and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis|12|13|Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
Genesis|12|14|And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Genesis|12|15|And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis|12|16|And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
Genesis|12|17|And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
Genesis|12|18|And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Genesis|12|19|why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Genesis|12|20|And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
Genesis|13|1|And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
Genesis|13|2|And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis|13|3|And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,
Genesis|13|4|unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|13|5|And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis|13|6|And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis|13|7|And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
Genesis|13|8|And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.
Genesis|13|9|Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If {thou wilt take} the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if {thou take} the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Genesis|13|10|And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.
Genesis|13|11|So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis|13|12|Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis|13|13|Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.
Genesis|13|14|And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
Genesis|13|15|for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Genesis|13|16|And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
Genesis|13|17|Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
Genesis|13|18|And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.
Genesis|14|1|And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis|14|2|that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
Genesis|14|3|All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
Genesis|14|4|Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis|14|5|And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis|14|6|and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
