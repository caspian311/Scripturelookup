Acts|18|25|This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:
Acts|18|26|and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.
Acts|18|27|And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;
Acts|18|28|for he powerfully confuted the Jews, {and that} publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|19|1|And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:
Acts|19|2|and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they {said} unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Spirit was {given}.
Acts|19|3|And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.
Acts|19|4|And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
Acts|19|5|And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|19|6|And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
Acts|19|7|And they were in all about twelve men.
Acts|19|8|And he entered into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading {as to} the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts|19|9|But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
Acts|19|10|And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts|19|11|And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Acts|19|12|insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.
Acts|19|13|But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
Acts|19|14|And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.
Acts|19|15|And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?
Acts|19|16|And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts|19|17|And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts|19|18|Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
Acts|19|19|And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts|19|20|So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.
Acts|19|21|Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Acts|19|22|And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
Acts|19|23|And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
Acts|19|24|For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;
Acts|19|25|whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.
Acts|19|26|And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:
Acts|19|27|and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
Acts|19|28|And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.
Acts|19|29|And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.
Acts|19|30|And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
Acts|19|31|And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.
Acts|19|32|Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
Acts|19|33|And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.
Acts|19|34|But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts|19|35|And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the {image} which fell down from Jupiter?
Acts|19|36|Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
Acts|19|37|For ye have brought {hither} these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts|19|38|If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.
Acts|19|39|But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
Acts|19|40|For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day’s riot, there being no cause {for it}: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.
Acts|19|41|And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
Acts|20|1|And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
Acts|20|2|And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
Acts|20|3|And when he had spent three months {there,} and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
Acts|20|4|And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater of Beroea, {the son} of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts|20|5|But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts|20|6|And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.
Acts|20|7|And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.
Acts|20|8|And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
Acts|20|9|And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Acts|20|10|And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.
Acts|20|11|And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
Acts|20|12|And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.
Acts|20|13|But we going before to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.
Acts|20|14|And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
Acts|20|15|And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.
Acts|20|16|For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
Acts|20|17|And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.
Acts|20|18|And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,
Acts|20|19|serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;
Acts|20|20|how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house,
Acts|20|21|testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|20|22|And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
Acts|20|23|save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
Acts|20|24|But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts|20|25|And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
Acts|20|26|Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
Acts|20|27|For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.
Acts|20|28|Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.
Acts|20|29|I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock;
Acts|20|30|and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts|20|31|Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.
Acts|20|32|And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build {you} up, and to give {you} the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
Acts|20|33|I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Acts|20|34|Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
Acts|20|35|In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Acts|20|36|And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
Acts|20|37|And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,
Acts|20|38|sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.
Acts|21|1|And when it came to pass that were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Acts|21|2|and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
Acts|21|3|And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Acts|21|4|And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts|21|5|And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;
Acts|21|6|and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.
Acts|21|7|And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Acts|21|8|And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.
Acts|21|9|Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.
Acts|21|10|And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Acts|21|11|And coming to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts|21|12|And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|13|Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|21|14|And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Acts|21|15|And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|16|And there went with us also {certain} of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing {with them} one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Acts|21|17|And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
