John|17|2|even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.
John|17|3|And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, {even} Jesus Christ.
John|17|4|I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.
John|17|5|And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
John|17|6|I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
John|17|7|Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:
John|17|8|for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received {them}, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
John|17|9|I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:
John|17|10|and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
John|17|11|And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we {are}.
John|17|12|While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
John|17|13|But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
John|17|14|I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John|17|15|I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil {one}.
John|17|16|They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
John|17|17|Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.
John|17|18|As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.
John|17|19|And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
John|17|20|Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;
John|17|21|that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, {art} in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
John|17|22|And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we {are} one;
John|17|23|I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.
John|17|24|Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
John|17|25|O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;
John|17|26|and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.
John|18|1|When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.
John|18|2|Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.
John|18|3|Judas then, having received the band {of soldiers}, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John|18|4|Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?
John|18|5|They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am {he}. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
John|18|6|When therefore he said unto them, I am {he}, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
John|18|7|Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
John|18|8|Jesus answered, I told you that I am {he}; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
John|18|9|that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.
John|18|10|Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.
John|18|11|Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
John|18|12|So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
John|18|13|and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John|18|14|Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
John|18|15|And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and {so did} another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
John|18|16|but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
John|18|17|The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter, Art thou also {one} of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.
John|18|18|Now the servants and the officers were standing {there}, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
John|18|19|The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
John|18|20|Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.
John|18|21|Why askest thou me? Ask them that have heard {me}, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.
John|18|22|And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
John|18|23|Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
John|18|24|Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
John|18|25|Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also {one} of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.
John|18|26|One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
John|18|27|Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.
John|18|28|They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
John|18|29|Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?
John|18|30|They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.
John|18|31|Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
John|18|32|that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|18|33|Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
John|18|34|Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?
John|18|35|Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
John|18|36|Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
John|18|37|Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
John|18|38|Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.
John|18|39|But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
John|18|40|They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)
John|19|1|Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
John|19|2|And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;
John|19|3|and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.
John|19|4|And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.
John|19|5|Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And {Pilate} saith unto them, Behold, the man!
John|19|6|When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify {him}, crucify {him}! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.
John|19|7|The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
John|19|8|When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;
John|19|9|and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John|19|10|Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?
John|19|11|Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.
John|19|12|Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
John|19|13|When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John|19|14|Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!
John|19|15|They therefore cried out, Away with {him}, away with {him}, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
John|19|16|Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.
John|19|17|They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:
John|19|18|where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
John|19|19|And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John|19|20|This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, {and} in Latin, {and} in Greek.
John|19|21|The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
John|19|22|Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
John|19|23|The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John|19|24|They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,             They parted my garments among them,                   And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
John|19|25|These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the {wife} of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John|19|26|When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
John|19|27|Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own {home}.
John|19|28|After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
John|19|29|There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.
John|19|30|When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
John|19|31|The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high {day}), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and {that} they might be taken away.
John|19|32|The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:
John|19|33|but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
John|19|34|howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.
John|19|35|And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.
