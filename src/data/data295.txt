1 Samuel|9|18|Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.
1 Samuel|9|19|And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
1 Samuel|9|20|And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father’s house?
1 Samuel|9|21|And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?
1 Samuel|9|22|And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.
1 Samuel|9|23|And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
1 Samuel|9|24|And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And {Samuel} said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
1 Samuel|9|25|And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.
1 Samuel|9|26|And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1 Samuel|9|27|As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.
1 Samuel|10|1|Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?
1 Samuel|10|2|When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1 Samuel|10|3|Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
1 Samuel|10|4|and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.
1 Samuel|10|5|After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:
1 Samuel|10|6|and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
1 Samuel|10|7|And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.
1 Samuel|10|8|And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.
1 Samuel|10|9|And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
1 Samuel|10|10|And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
1 Samuel|10|11|And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|12|And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|13|And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1 Samuel|10|14|And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.
1 Samuel|10|15|And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
1 Samuel|10|16|And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
1 Samuel|10|17|And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;
1 Samuel|10|18|and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
1 Samuel|10|19|but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, {Nay}, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
1 Samuel|10|20|So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1 Samuel|10|21|And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.
1 Samuel|10|22|Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
1 Samuel|10|23|And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1 Samuel|10|24|And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, {Long} live the king.
1 Samuel|10|25|Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
1 Samuel|10|26|And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.
1 Samuel|10|27|But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
1 Samuel|11|1|Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|11|2|And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1 Samuel|11|3|And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.
1 Samuel|11|4|Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|11|5|And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
1 Samuel|11|6|And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1 Samuel|11|7|And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
1 Samuel|11|8|And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1 Samuel|11|9|And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
1 Samuel|11|10|Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
1 Samuel|11|11|And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.
1 Samuel|11|12|And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1 Samuel|11|13|And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.
1 Samuel|11|14|Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
1 Samuel|11|15|And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel|12|1|And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|2|And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.
1 Samuel|12|3|Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
1 Samuel|12|4|And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.
1 Samuel|12|5|And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.
1 Samuel|12|6|And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|12|7|Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|8|When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
1 Samuel|12|9|But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
1 Samuel|12|10|And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|12|11|And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.
1 Samuel|12|12|And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.
1 Samuel|12|13|Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|14|If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, {well}:
1 Samuel|12|15|but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|16|Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
1 Samuel|12|17|Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.
1 Samuel|12|18|So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
1 Samuel|12|19|And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins {this} evil, to ask us a king.
1 Samuel|12|20|And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:
1 Samuel|12|21|and turn ye not aside; for {then would ye go} after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
1 Samuel|12|22|For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.
1 Samuel|12|23|Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
1 Samuel|12|24|Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.
1 Samuel|12|25|But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
1 Samuel|13|1|Saul was {forty} years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1 Samuel|13|2|Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
1 Samuel|13|3|And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1 Samuel|13|4|And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
1 Samuel|13|5|And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.
1 Samuel|13|6|When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
1 Samuel|13|7|Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1 Samuel|13|8|And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel {had appointed}: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
1 Samuel|13|9|And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|10|And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
1 Samuel|13|11|And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;
1 Samuel|13|12|therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|13|And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
1 Samuel|13|14|But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
1 Samuel|13|15|And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.      And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1 Samuel|13|16|And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1 Samuel|13|17|And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
1 Samuel|13|18|and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel|13|19|Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
1 Samuel|13|20|but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
1 Samuel|13|21|yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
1 Samuel|13|22|So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
1 Samuel|13|23|And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.
