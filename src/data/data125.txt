Nahum|1|5|The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
Nahum|1|6|Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.
Nahum|1|7|Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.
Nahum|1|8|But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
Nahum|1|9|What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum|1|10|For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
Nahum|1|11|There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.
Nahum|1|12|Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
Nahum|1|13|And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
Nahum|1|14|And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
Nahum|1|15|Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
Nahum|2|1|He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
Nahum|2|2|For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.
Nahum|2|3|The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress {spears} are brandished.
Nahum|2|4|The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.
Nahum|2|5|He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.
Nahum|2|6|The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
Nahum|2|7|And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.
Nahum|2|8|But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, {they cry}; but none looketh back.
Nahum|2|9|Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
Nahum|2|10|She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
Nahum|2|11|Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion {and} the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?
Nahum|2|12|The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.
Nahum|2|13|Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
Nahum|3|1|Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.
Nahum|3|2|The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
Nahum|3|3|the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon their bodies;-
Nahum|3|4|because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
Nahum|3|5|Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
Nahum|3|6|And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.
Nahum|3|7|And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
Nahum|3|8|Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, {and} her wall was of the sea?
Nahum|3|9|Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
Nahum|3|10|Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
Nahum|3|11|Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
Nahum|3|12|All thy fortresses shall be {like} fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
Nahum|3|13|Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.
Nahum|3|14|Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.
Nahum|3|15|There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm: make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.
Nahum|3|16|Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.
Nahum|3|17|Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
Nahum|3|18|Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.
Nahum|3|19|There is no assuaging of thy hurt: thy wound is grievous: all that hear the report of thee clap their hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?
1 Kings|1|1|Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1 Kings|1|2|Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1 Kings|1|3|So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1 Kings|1|4|And the damsel was very fair; and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
1 Kings|1|5|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1 Kings|1|6|And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.
1 Kings|1|7|And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1 Kings|1|8|But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|9|And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:
1 Kings|1|10|but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1 Kings|1|11|Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1 Kings|1|12|Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1 Kings|1|13|Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
1 Kings|1|14|Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1 Kings|1|15|And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.
1 Kings|1|16|And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1 Kings|1|17|And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by Jehovah thy God unto thy handmaid, {saying}, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1 Kings|1|18|And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:
1 Kings|1|19|and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|20|And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1 Kings|1|21|Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1 Kings|1|22|And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
1 Kings|1|23|And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1 Kings|1|24|And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1 Kings|1|25|For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, {Long} live king Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|26|But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|27|Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not showed unto thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1 Kings|1|28|Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
1 Kings|1|29|And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
1 Kings|1|30|verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.
1 Kings|1|31|Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1 Kings|1|32|And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1 Kings|1|33|And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1 Kings|1|34|and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye the trumpet, and say, {Long} live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|35|Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
1 Kings|1|36|And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so {too}.
1 Kings|1|37|As Jehovah hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
1 Kings|1|38|So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings|1|39|And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, {Long} live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|40|And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1 Kings|1|41|And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1 Kings|1|42|While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.
1 Kings|1|43|And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:
1 Kings|1|44|and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;
1 Kings|1|45|and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1 Kings|1|46|And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings|1|47|And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1 Kings|1|48|And also thus said the king, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
1 Kings|1|49|And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1 Kings|1|50|And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|1|51|And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1 Kings|1|52|And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
1 Kings|1|53|So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.
1 Kings|2|1|Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
1 Kings|2|2|I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
1 Kings|2|3|and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, {and} his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
1 Kings|2|4|That Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
