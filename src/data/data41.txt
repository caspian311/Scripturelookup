2 Samuel|22|26|With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful;                   With the perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
2 Samuel|22|27|With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure;                   And with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward.
2 Samuel|22|28|And the afflicted people thou wilt save;                   But thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
2 Samuel|22|29|For thou art my lamp, O Jehovah;                   And Jehovah will lighten my darkness.
2 Samuel|22|30|For by thee I run upon a troop;                   By my God do I leap over a wall.
2 Samuel|22|31|As for God, his way is perfect:                   The word of Jehovah is tried;                   He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in him.
2 Samuel|22|32|For who is God, save Jehovah?                   And who is a rock, save our God?
2 Samuel|22|33|God is my strong fortress;                   And he guideth the perfect in his way.
2 Samuel|22|34|He maketh his feet like hinds’ {feet},                   And setteth me upon my high places.
2 Samuel|22|35|He teacheth my hands to war,                   So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
2 Samuel|22|36|Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation;                   And thy gentleness hath made me great.
2 Samuel|22|37|Thou hast enlarged my steps under me;                   And my feet have not slipped.
2 Samuel|22|38|I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;                   Neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
2 Samuel|22|39|And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, so that they cannot arise:                   Yea, they are fallen under my feet.
2 Samuel|22|40|For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;                   Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
2 Samuel|22|41|Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,                   That I might cut off them that hate me.
2 Samuel|22|42|They looked, but there was none to save;                   Even unto Jehovah, but he answered them not.
2 Samuel|22|43|Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,                   I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.
2 Samuel|22|44|Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people;                   Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations:                   A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
2 Samuel|22|45|The foreigners shall submit themselves unto me:                   As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.
2 Samuel|22|46|The foreigners shall fade away,                   And shall come trembling out of their close places.
2 Samuel|22|47|Jehovah liveth; And blessed be my rock;                   And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
2 Samuel|22|48|Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,                   And that bringeth down peoples under me,
2 Samuel|22|49|And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies:                   Yea, thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;                   Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
2 Samuel|22|50|Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah, among the nations,                   And will sing praises unto thy name.
2 Samuel|22|51|Great deliverance giveth he to his king,                   And showeth lovingkindness to his anointed,                   To David and to his seed, for evermore.
2 Samuel|23|1|Now these are the last words of David.             David the son of Jesse saith,                   And the man who was raised on high saith,                   The anointed of the God of Jacob,                   And the sweet psalmist of Israel:
2 Samuel|23|2|The Spirit of Jehovah spake by me,                   And his word was upon my tongue.
2 Samuel|23|3|The God of Israel said,                   The Rock of Israel spake to me:                   One that ruleth over men righteously,                   That ruleth in the fear of God,
2 Samuel|23|4|{He shall be} as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,                   A morning without clouds,                           {When} the tender grass {springeth} out of the earth,                   Through clear shining after rain.
2 Samuel|23|5|Verily my house is not so with God;                   Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant,                   Ordered in all things, and sure:                   For it is all my salvation, and all {my} desire,                   Although he maketh it not to grow.
2 Samuel|23|6|But the ungodly shall be all of them as thorns to be thrust away,                   Because they cannot be taken with the hand;
2 Samuel|23|7|But the man that toucheth them                   Must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear:                   And they shall be utterly burned with fire in {their} place.
2 Samuel|23|8|These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.
2 Samuel|23|9|And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away.
2 Samuel|23|10|He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and Jehovah wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to take spoil.
2 Samuel|23|11|And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel|23|12|But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah wrought a great victory.
2 Samuel|23|13|And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|23|14|And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
2 Samuel|23|15|And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
2 Samuel|23|16|And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.
2 Samuel|23|17|And he said, Be it far from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this: {shall I drink} the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
2 Samuel|23|18|And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.
2 Samuel|23|19|Was he not most honorable of the three? therefore he was made their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the {first} three.
2 Samuel|23|20|And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two {sons of} Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
2 Samuel|23|21|And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
2 Samuel|23|22|These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
2 Samuel|23|23|He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three. And David set him over his guard.
2 Samuel|23|24|Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
2 Samuel|23|25|Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
2 Samuel|23|26|Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
2 Samuel|23|27|Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2 Samuel|23|28|Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
2 Samuel|23|29|Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
2 Samuel|23|30|Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
2 Samuel|23|31|Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2 Samuel|23|32|Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,
2 Samuel|23|33|Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite,
2 Samuel|23|34|Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2 Samuel|23|35|Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
2 Samuel|23|36|Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
2 Samuel|23|37|Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
2 Samuel|23|38|Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
2 Samuel|23|39|Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
2 Samuel|24|1|And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel|24|2|And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.
2 Samuel|24|3|And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
2 Samuel|24|4|Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|24|5|And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:
2 Samuel|24|6|then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,
2 Samuel|24|7|and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|24|8|So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2 Samuel|24|9|And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2 Samuel|24|10|And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
2 Samuel|24|11|And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
2 Samuel|24|12|Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
2 Samuel|24|13|So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
2 Samuel|24|14|And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
2 Samuel|24|15|So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
2 Samuel|24|16|And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|17|And David spake unto Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.
2 Samuel|24|18|And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|19|And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
2 Samuel|24|20|And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
2 Samuel|24|21|And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
2 Samuel|24|22|And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
2 Samuel|24|23|all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.
2 Samuel|24|24|And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
2 Samuel|24|25|And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
3 John|1|1|The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
3 John|1|2|Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 John|1|3|For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
3 John|1|4|Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
3 John|1|5|Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
3 John|1|6|who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
3 John|1|7|because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3 John|1|8|We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
3 John|1|9|I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
3 John|1|10|Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth {them} out of the church.
