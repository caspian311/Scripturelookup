Habakkuk|1|1|The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk|1|2|O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.
Habakkuk|1|3|Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.
Habakkuk|1|4|Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.
Habakkuk|1|5|Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.
Habakkuk|1|6|For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
Habakkuk|1|7|They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk|1|8|Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.
Habakkuk|1|9|They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.
Habakkuk|1|10|Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.
Habakkuk|1|11|Then shall he sweep by {as} a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, {even} he whose might is his god.
Habakkuk|1|12|Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.
Habakkuk|1|13|Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;
Habakkuk|1|14|and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
Habakkuk|1|15|He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.
Habakkuk|1|16|Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.
Habakkuk|1|17|Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?
Habakkuk|2|1|I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.
Habakkuk|2|2|And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.
Habakkuk|2|3|For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.
Habakkuk|2|4|Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.
Habakkuk|2|5|Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.
Habakkuk|2|6|Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!
Habakkuk|2|7|Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?
Habakkuk|2|8|Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|9|Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
Habakkuk|2|10|Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.
Habakkuk|2|11|For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
Habakkuk|2|12|Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!
Habakkuk|2|13|Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
Habakkuk|2|14|For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk|2|15|Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, {to thee} that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
Habakkuk|2|16|Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.
Habakkuk|2|17|For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|18|What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
Habakkuk|2|19|Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
Habakkuk|2|20|But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
Habakkuk|3|1|A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.
Habakkuk|3|2|O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid:                   O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years;                   In the midst of the years make it known;                   In wrath remember mercy.
Habakkuk|3|3|God came from Teman,                   And the Holy One from mount Paran.            Selah.             His glory covered the heavens,                   And the earth was full of his praise.
Habakkuk|3|4|And {his} brightness was as the light;                   He had rays {coming forth} from his hand;                   And there was the hiding of his power.
Habakkuk|3|5|Before him went the pestilence,                   And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
Habakkuk|3|6|He stood, and measured the earth;                   He beheld, and drove asunder the nations;                   And the eternal mountains were scattered;                   The everlasting hills did bow;                   His goings were {as} of old.
Habakkuk|3|7|I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;                   The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk|3|8|Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers?                   Was thine anger against the rivers,                   Or thy wrath against the sea,                   That thou didst ride upon thy horses,                   Upon thy chariots of salvation?
Habakkuk|3|9|Thy bow was made quite bare;                   The oaths to the tribes were a {sure} word.            Selah.             Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk|3|10|The mountains saw thee, and were afraid;                   The tempest of waters passed by;                   The deep uttered its voice,                   And lifted up its hands on high.
Habakkuk|3|11|The sun and moon stood still in their habitation,                   At the light of thine arrows as they went,                   At the shining of thy glittering spear.
Habakkuk|3|12|Thou didst march though the land in indignation;                   Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.
Habakkuk|3|13|Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,                   For the salvation of thine anointed;                   Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man,                   Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.            Selah.
Habakkuk|3|14|Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors:                   They came as a whirlwind to scatter me;                   Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
Habakkuk|3|15|Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses,                   The heap of mighty waters.
Habakkuk|3|16|I heard, and my body trembled,                   My lips quivered at the voice;                   Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place;                   Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,                   For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.
Habakkuk|3|17|For though the fig-tree shall not flourish,                   Neither shall fruit be in the vines;                   The labor of the olive shall fail,                   And the fields shall yield no food;                   The flock shall be cut off from the fold,                   And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
Habakkuk|3|18|Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah,                   I will joy in the God of my salvation.
Habakkuk|3|19|Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength;                   And he maketh my feet like hinds’ {feet},                   And will make me to walk upon my high places.
Jonah|1|1|Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
Jonah|1|2|Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
Jonah|1|3|But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.
Jonah|1|4|But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
Jonah|1|5|Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
Jonah|1|6|So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
Jonah|1|7|And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
Jonah|1|8|Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
Jonah|1|9|And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.
Jonah|1|10|Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
Jonah|1|11|Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
Jonah|1|12|And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
Jonah|1|13|Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
Jonah|1|14|Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.
Jonah|1|15|So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
Jonah|1|16|Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.
Jonah|1|17|And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah|2|1|Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish’s belly.
Jonah|2|2|And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, {And} thou heardest my voice.
Jonah|2|3|For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
Jonah|2|4|And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|5|The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.
Jonah|2|6|I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars {closed} upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
Jonah|2|7|When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|8|They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.
Jonah|2|9|But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.
Jonah|2|10|And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
Jonah|3|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah|3|2|Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
Jonah|3|3|So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.
Jonah|3|4|And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
Jonah|3|5|And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
Jonah|3|6|And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
Jonah|3|7|And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;
Jonah|3|8|but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
Jonah|3|9|Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
Jonah|3|10|And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.
Jonah|4|1|But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
Jonah|4|2|And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
Jonah|4|3|Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|4|And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?
Jonah|4|5|Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
Jonah|4|6|And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.
Jonah|4|7|But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
