2 Samuel|13|11|And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
2 Samuel|13|12|And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
2 Samuel|13|13|And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
2 Samuel|13|14|Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
2 Samuel|13|15|Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
2 Samuel|13|16|And she said unto him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is {worse} than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
2 Samuel|13|17|Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|18|And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|19|And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
2 Samuel|13|20|And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
2 Samuel|13|21|But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
2 Samuel|13|22|And Absalom spake unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel|13|23|And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|13|24|And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
2 Samuel|13|25|And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
2 Samuel|13|26|Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
2 Samuel|13|27|But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2 Samuel|13|28|And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
2 Samuel|13|29|And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.
2 Samuel|13|30|And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.
2 Samuel|13|31|Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
2 Samuel|13|32|And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel|13|33|Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
2 Samuel|13|34|But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.
2 Samuel|13|35|And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.
2 Samuel|13|36|And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
2 Samuel|13|37|But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. And {David} mourned for his son every day.
2 Samuel|13|38|So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2 Samuel|13|39|And {the soul of} king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
2 Samuel|14|1|Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel|14|2|And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:
2 Samuel|14|3|and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2 Samuel|14|4|And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
2 Samuel|14|5|And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
2 Samuel|14|6|And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.
2 Samuel|14|7|And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they say, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.
2 Samuel|14|8|And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
2 Samuel|14|9|And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
2 Samuel|14|10|And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
2 Samuel|14|11|Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
2 Samuel|14|12|Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
2 Samuel|14|13|And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.
2 Samuel|14|14|For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.
2 Samuel|14|15|Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|16|For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
2 Samuel|14|17|Then thy handmaid said, Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: and Jehovah thy God be with thee.
2 Samuel|14|18|Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
2 Samuel|14|19|And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;
2 Samuel|14|20|to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
2 Samuel|14|21|And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
2 Samuel|14|22|And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|23|So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|14|24|And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face. So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.
2 Samuel|14|25|Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel|14|26|And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.
2 Samuel|14|27|And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
2 Samuel|14|28|And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king’s face.
2 Samuel|14|29|Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
2 Samuel|14|30|Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2 Samuel|14|31|Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
2 Samuel|14|32|And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.
2 Samuel|14|33|So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2 Samuel|15|2|And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
2 Samuel|15|3|And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
2 Samuel|15|4|Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
2 Samuel|15|5|And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
2 Samuel|15|6|And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel|15|7|And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|8|For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.
2 Samuel|15|9|And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|10|But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|11|And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.
2 Samuel|15|12|And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|13|And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|14|And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
2 Samuel|15|15|And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.
2 Samuel|15|16|And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.
2 Samuel|15|17|And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.
2 Samuel|15|18|And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
2 Samuel|15|19|Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king: for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile; {return} to thine own place.
2 Samuel|15|20|Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
2 Samuel|15|21|And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.
2 Samuel|15|22|And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
2 Samuel|15|23|And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
2 Samuel|15|24|And, lo, Zadok also {came}, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
2 Samuel|15|25|And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
2 Samuel|15|26|but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
2 Samuel|15|27|The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art thou {not} a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
2 Samuel|15|28|See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
2 Samuel|15|29|Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.
2 Samuel|15|30|And David went up by the ascent of the {mount of} Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2 Samuel|15|31|And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
2 Samuel|15|32|And it came to pass, that, when David was come to the top {of the ascent}, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
2 Samuel|15|33|And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:
2 Samuel|15|34|but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
2 Samuel|15|35|And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
2 Samuel|15|36|Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.
2 Samuel|15|37|So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|16|1|And when David was a little past the top {of the ascent}, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
