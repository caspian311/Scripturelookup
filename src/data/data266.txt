2 Corinthians|9|9|as it is written,             He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor;                   His righteousness abideth for ever.
2 Corinthians|9|10|And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:
2 Corinthians|9|11|ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians|9|12|For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;
2 Corinthians|9|13|seeing that through the proving {of you} by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of {your} contribution unto them and unto all;
2 Corinthians|9|14|while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
2 Corinthians|9|15|Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians|10|1|Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:
2 Corinthians|10|2|yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians|10|3|For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh
2 Corinthians|10|4|(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds),
2 Corinthians|10|5|casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
2 Corinthians|10|6|and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.
2 Corinthians|10|7|Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
2 Corinthians|10|8|For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:
2 Corinthians|10|9|that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
2 Corinthians|10|10|For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.
2 Corinthians|10|11|Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such {are we} also in deed when we are present.
2 Corinthians|10|12|For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
2 Corinthians|10|13|But we will not glory beyond {our} measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.
2 Corinthians|10|14|For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:
2 Corinthians|10|15|not glorying beyond {our} measure, {that is,} in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto {further} abundance,
2 Corinthians|10|16|so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, {and} not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.
2 Corinthians|10|17|But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2 Corinthians|10|18|For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2 Corinthians|11|1|Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.
2 Corinthians|11|2|For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you {as} a pure virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|3|But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|4|For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or {if} ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with {him}.
2 Corinthians|11|5|For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2 Corinthians|11|6|But though {I be} rude in speech, yet {am I} not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made {this} manifest unto you in all things.
2 Corinthians|11|7|Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?
2 Corinthians|11|8|I robbed other churches, taking wages {of them} that I might minister unto you;
2 Corinthians|11|9|and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and {so} will I keep {myself}.
2 Corinthians|11|10|As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians|11|11|Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2 Corinthians|11|12|But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2 Corinthians|11|13|For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|14|And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians|11|15|It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians|11|16|I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if {ye do}, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.
2 Corinthians|11|17|That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.
2 Corinthians|11|18|Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2 Corinthians|11|19|For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise {yourselves}.
2 Corinthians|11|20|For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you {captive}, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.
2 Corinthians|11|21|I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
2 Corinthians|11|22|Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2 Corinthians|11|23|Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.
2 Corinthians|11|24|Of the Jews five times received I forty {stripes} save one.
2 Corinthians|11|25|Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;
2 Corinthians|11|26|{in} journeyings often, {in} perils of rivers, {in} perils of robbers, {in} perils from {my} countrymen, {in} perils from the Gentiles, {in} perils in the city, {in} perils in the wilderness, {in} perils in the sea, {in} perils among false brethren;
2 Corinthians|11|27|{in} labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2 Corinthians|11|28|Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.
2 Corinthians|11|29|Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?
2 Corinthians|11|30|If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.
2 Corinthians|11|31|The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.
2 Corinthians|11|32|In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:
2 Corinthians|11|33|and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2 Corinthians|12|1|I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians|12|2|I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
2 Corinthians|12|3|And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),
2 Corinthians|12|4|how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2 Corinthians|12|5|On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in {my} weaknesses.
2 Corinthians|12|6|For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me {to be}, or heareth from me.
2 Corinthians|12|7|And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.
2 Corinthians|12|8|Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
2 Corinthians|12|9|And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for {my} power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians|12|10|Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2 Corinthians|12|11|I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
2 Corinthians|12|12|Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians|12|13|For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except {it be} that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.
2 Corinthians|12|14|Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2 Corinthians|12|15|And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
2 Corinthians|12|16|But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2 Corinthians|12|17|Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?
2 Corinthians|12|18|I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? {walked we} not in the same steps?
2 Corinthians|12|19|Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, {are} for your edifying.
2 Corinthians|12|20|For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means {there should be} strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;
2 Corinthians|12|21|lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.
2 Corinthians|13|1|This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word established.
2 Corinthians|13|2|I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
2 Corinthians|13|3|seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:
2 Corinthians|13|4|for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.
2 Corinthians|13|5|Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|6|But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|7|Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|8|For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2 Corinthians|13|9|For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
2 Corinthians|13|10|For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.
2 Corinthians|13|11|Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
2 Corinthians|13|12|Salute one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians|13|13|All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians|13|14|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
Psalms|1|1|Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,                      Nor standeth in the way of sinners,                      Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:
Psalms|1|2|But his delight is in the law of Jehovah;                      And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
Psalms|1|3|And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,                      That bringeth forth its fruit in its season,                      Whose leaf also doth not wither;                      And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Psalms|1|4|The wicked are not so,                      But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
Psalms|1|5|Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,                      Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psalms|1|6|For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous;                      But the way of the wicked shall perish.
Psalms|2|1|Why do the nations rage,                      And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
