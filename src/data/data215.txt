Exodus|24|2|and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.
Exodus|24|3|And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.

Exodus|24|8|And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words.
Exodus|24|9|Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|24|10|And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
Exodus|24|11|And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.
