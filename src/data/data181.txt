Mark|4|30|And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?
Mark|4|31|It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,
Mark|4|32|yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.
Mark|4|33|And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;
Mark|4|34|and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
Mark|4|35|And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.
Mark|4|36|And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.
Mark|4|37|And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.
Mark|4|38|And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark|4|39|And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark|4|40|And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?
Mark|4|41|And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
Mark|5|1|And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
Mark|5|2|And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark|5|3|who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;
Mark|5|4|because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.
Mark|5|5|And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
Mark|5|6|And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;
Mark|5|7|and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.
Mark|5|8|For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.
Mark|5|9|And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.
Mark|5|10|And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark|5|11|Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark|5|12|And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark|5|13|And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, {in number} about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.
Mark|5|14|And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.
Mark|5|15|And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, {even} him that had the legion: and they were afraid.
Mark|5|16|And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.
Mark|5|17|And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
Mark|5|18|And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.
Mark|5|19|And he suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and {how} he had mercy on thee.
Mark|5|20|And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.
Mark|5|21|And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.
Mark|5|22|And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,
Mark|5|23|and beseecheth him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: {I pray thee}, that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.
Mark|5|24|And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.
Mark|5|25|And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark|5|26|and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
Mark|5|27|having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.
Mark|5|28|For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.
Mark|5|29|And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.
Mark|5|30|And straightway Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power {proceeding} from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?
Mark|5|31|And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Mark|5|32|And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark|5|33|But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
Mark|5|34|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Mark|5|35|While he yet spake, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s {house} saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?
Mark|5|36|But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
Mark|5|37|And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark|5|38|And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he beholdeth a tumult, and {many} weeping and wailing greatly.
Mark|5|39|And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.
Mark|5|40|And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.
Mark|5|41|And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.
Mark|5|42|And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.
Mark|5|43|And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that {something} should be given her to eat.
Mark|6|1|And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
Mark|6|2|And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, Whence hath this man these things? and, What is the wisdom that is given unto this man, and {what mean} such mighty works wrought by his hands?
Mark|6|3|Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.
Mark|6|4|And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
Mark|6|5|And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
Mark|6|6|And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.
Mark|6|7|And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
Mark|6|8|and he charged them that they should take nothing for {their} journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;
Mark|6|9|but {to go} shod with sandals: and, {said he}, put not on two coats.
Mark|6|10|And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.
Mark|6|11|And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.
Mark|6|12|And they went out, and preached that {men} should repent.
Mark|6|13|And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
Mark|6|14|And king Herod heard {thereof}; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.
Mark|6|15|But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, {It is} a prophet, {even} as one of the prophets.
Mark|6|16|But Herod, when he heard {thereof}, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.
Mark|6|17|For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.
Mark|6|18|For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
Mark|6|19|And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;
Mark|6|20|for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.
Mark|6|21|And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;
Mark|6|22|and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
Mark|6|23|And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
Mark|6|24|And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.
Mark|6|25|And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Mark|6|26|And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.
Mark|6|27|And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark|6|28|and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
Mark|6|29|And when his disciples heard {thereof}, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
Mark|6|30|And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.
Mark|6|31|And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
Mark|6|32|And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.
Mark|6|33|And {the people} saw them going, and many knew {them}, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.
Mark|6|34|And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
Mark|6|35|And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;
Mark|6|36|send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.
Mark|6|37|But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark|6|38|And he saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go {and} see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
Mark|6|39|And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark|6|40|And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark|6|41|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
Mark|6|42|And they all ate, and were filled.
Mark|6|43|And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.
Mark|6|44|And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark|6|45|And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before {him} unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.
