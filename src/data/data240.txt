Acts|27|27|But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the {sea of} Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:
Acts|27|28|and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.
Acts|27|29|And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.
Acts|27|30|And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,
Acts|27|31|Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Acts|27|32|Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
Acts|27|33|And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
Acts|27|34|Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.
Acts|27|35|And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.
Acts|27|36|Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.
Acts|27|37|And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Acts|27|38|And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts|27|39|And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.
Acts|27|40|And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
Acts|27|41|But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence {of the waves}.
Acts|27|42|And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any {of them} should swim out, and escape.
Acts|27|43|But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;
Acts|27|44|and the rest, some on planks, and some on {other} things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.
Acts|28|1|And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.
Acts|28|2|And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Acts|28|3|But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Acts|28|4|And when the barbarians saw the {venomous} creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.
Acts|28|5|Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.
Acts|28|6|But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
Acts|28|7|Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.
Acts|28|8|And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.
Acts|28|9|And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:
Acts|28|10|who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.
Acts|28|11|And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.
Acts|28|12|And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
Acts|28|13|And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;
Acts|28|14|where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.
Acts|28|15|And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
Acts|28|16|And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
Acts|28|17|And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
Acts|28|18|who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.
Acts|28|19|But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.
Acts|28|20|For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with {me}: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Acts|28|21|And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.
Acts|28|22|But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.
Acts|28|23|And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded {the matter,} testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.
Acts|28|24|And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
Acts|28|25|And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,
Acts|28|26|saying,             Go thou unto this people, and say,                   By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;                   And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
Acts|28|27|For this people’s heart is waxed gross,                   And their ears are dull of hearing,                   And their eyes they have closed;                   Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes,                   And hear with their ears,                   And understand with their heart,                   And should turn again,                   And I should heal them.
Acts|28|28|Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.
Acts|28|29|{And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.}
Acts|28|30|And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,
Acts|28|31|preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.
Micah|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Micah|1|2|Hear, ye peoples, all of you: hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
Micah|1|3|For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
Micah|1|4|And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.
Micah|1|5|For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
Micah|1|6|Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, {and} as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.
Micah|1|7|And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.
Micah|1|8|For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.
Micah|1|9|For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
Micah|1|10|Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.
Micah|1|11|Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.
Micah|1|12|For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah|1|13|Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
Micah|1|14|Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
Micah|1|15|I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.
Micah|1|16|Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
Micah|2|1|Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
Micah|2|2|And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
Micah|2|3|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
Micah|2|4|In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, {and} say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove {it} from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.
Micah|2|5|Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.
Micah|2|6|Prophesy ye not, {thus} they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.
Micah|2|7|Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
Micah|2|8|But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely {as men} averse from war.
Micah|2|9|The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.
Micah|2|10|Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.
Micah|2|11|If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, {saying}, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
Micah|2|12|I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of {the multitude of} men.
Micah|2|13|The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.
Micah|3|1|And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
Micah|3|2|ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Micah|3|3|who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
Micah|3|4|Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.
Micah|3|5|Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
Micah|3|6|Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
Micah|3|7|And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.
Micah|3|8|But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Micah|3|9|Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.
Micah|3|10|They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Micah|3|11|The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
Micah|3|12|Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
Micah|4|1|But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.
Micah|4|2|And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;
Micah|4|3|and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Micah|4|4|But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.
Micah|4|5|For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.
Micah|4|6|In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;
Micah|4|7|and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.
Micah|4|8|And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Micah|4|9|Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?
Micah|4|10|Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
