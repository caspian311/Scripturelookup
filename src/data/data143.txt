John|4|5|So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
John|4|6|and Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
John|4|7|There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
John|4|8|For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.
John|4|9|The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John|4|10|Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
John|4|11|The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?
John|4|12|Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
John|4|13|Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
John|4|14|but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.
John|4|15|The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
John|4|16|Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
John|4|17|The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:
John|4|18|for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.
John|4|19|The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John|4|20|Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
John|4|21|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
John|4|22|Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
John|4|23|But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.
John|4|24|God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
John|4|25|The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.
John|4|26|Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am {he}.
John|4|27|And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?
John|4|28|So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,
John|4|29|Come, see a man, who told me all things that {ever} I did: can this be the Christ?
John|4|30|They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
John|4|31|In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
John|4|32|But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.
John|4|33|The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him {aught} to eat?
John|4|34|Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
John|4|35|Say not ye, There are yet four months, and {then} cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.
John|4|36|He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
John|4|37|For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
John|4|38|I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.
John|4|39|And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that {ever} I did.
John|4|40|So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
John|4|41|And many more believed because of his word;
John|4|42|and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
John|4|43|And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
John|4|44|For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
John|4|45|So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
John|4|46|He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John|4|47|When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought {him} that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
John|4|48|Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.
John|4|49|The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
John|4|50|Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.
John|4|51|And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.
John|4|52|So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John|4|53|So the father knew that {it was} at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
John|4|54|This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
John|5|1|After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|5|2|Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep {gate} a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.
John|5|3|In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, {waiting for the moving of the water.}
John|5|4|{for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.}
John|5|5|And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.
John|5|6|When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time {in that case}, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?
John|5|7|The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
John|5|8|Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|9|And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.
John|5|10|So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.
John|5|11|But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|12|They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up {thy bed}, and walk?
John|5|13|But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.
John|5|14|Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.
John|5|15|The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
John|5|16|And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
John|5|17|But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.
John|5|18|For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
John|5|19|Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.
John|5|20|For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.
John|5|21|For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.
John|5|22|For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;
John|5|23|that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.
John|5|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.
John|5|25|Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.
John|5|26|For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:
John|5|27|and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
John|5|28|Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,
John|5|29|and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
John|5|30|I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John|5|31|If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
John|5|32|It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
John|5|33|Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.
John|5|34|But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.
John|5|35|He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.
John|5|36|But the witness which I have is greater than {that of} John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
John|5|37|And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
John|5|38|And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
John|5|39|Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;
John|5|40|and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.
John|5|41|I receive not glory from men.
John|5|42|But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.
John|5|43|I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
John|5|44|How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that {cometh} from the only God ye seek not?
John|5|45|Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, {even} Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.
John|5|46|For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.
John|5|47|But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
John|6|1|After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is {the sea} of Tiberias.
John|6|2|And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.
John|6|3|And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
