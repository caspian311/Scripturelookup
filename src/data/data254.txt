Ezra|4|10|and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest {of the country} beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|11|This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|12|Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.
Ezra|4|13|Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.
Ezra|4|14|Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
Ezra|4|15|that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.
Ezra|4|16|We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.
Ezra|4|17|{Then} sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest {of the country} beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.
Ezra|4|18|The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
Ezra|4|19|And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
Ezra|4|20|There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all {the country} beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.
Ezra|4|21|Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.
Ezra|4|22|And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra|4|23|Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
Ezra|4|24|Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra|5|1|Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel {prophesied they} unto them.
Ezra|5|2|Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
Ezra|5|3|At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|4|Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.
Ezra|5|5|But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.
Ezra|5|6|The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;
Ezra|5|7|they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.
Ezra|5|8|Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.
Ezra|5|9|Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|10|We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.
Ezra|5|11|And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.
Ezra|5|12|But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
Ezra|5|13|But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.
Ezra|5|14|And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
Ezra|5|15|and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.
Ezra|5|16|Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.
Ezra|5|17|Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
Ezra|6|1|Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
Ezra|6|2|And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:
Ezra|6|3|In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
Ezra|6|4|with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.
Ezra|6|5|And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God.
Ezra|6|6|Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:
Ezra|6|7|let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
Ezra|6|8|Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered.
Ezra|6|9|And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; {also} wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;
Ezra|6|10|that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
Ezra|6|11|Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:
Ezra|6|12|and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter {the same}, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.
Ezra|6|13|Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.
Ezra|6|14|And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
Ezra|6|15|And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
Ezra|6|16|And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
Ezra|6|17|And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Ezra|6|18|And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
Ezra|6|19|And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
Ezra|6|20|For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
Ezra|6|21|And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,
Ezra|6|22|and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
Ezra|7|1|Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
Ezra|7|2|the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
Ezra|7|3|the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
Ezra|7|4|the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
Ezra|7|5|the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;
Ezra|7|6|this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.
Ezra|7|7|And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
Ezra|7|8|And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
Ezra|7|9|For upon the first {day} of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first {day} of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
Ezra|7|10|For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.
Ezra|7|11|Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:
Ezra|7|12|Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.
Ezra|7|13|I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
Ezra|7|14|Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,
Ezra|7|15|and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
Ezra|7|16|and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|17|therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|18|And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.
Ezra|7|19|And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|20|And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure-house.
Ezra|7|21|And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,
Ezra|7|22|unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
Ezra|7|23|Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
Ezra|7|24|Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.
Ezra|7|25|And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.
Ezra|7|26|And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
Ezra|7|27|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|28|and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
Ezra|8|1|Now these are the heads of their fathers’ {houses}, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
Ezra|8|2|Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush.
Ezra|8|3|Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
Ezra|8|4|Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.
Ezra|8|5|Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.
Ezra|8|6|And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.
Ezra|8|7|And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.
Ezra|8|8|And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males.
Ezra|8|9|Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
Ezra|8|10|And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and threescore males.
Ezra|8|11|And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males.
Ezra|8|12|And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males.
Ezra|8|13|And of the sons of Adonikam, {that were} the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males.
Ezra|8|14|And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.
Ezra|8|15|And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
Ezra|8|16|Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.
Ezra|8|17|And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, {and} his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra|8|18|And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
