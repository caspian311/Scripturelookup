Psalms|105|43|And he brought forth his people with joy,                               {And} his chosen with singing.
Psalms|105|44|And he gave them the lands of the nations;                      And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
Psalms|105|45|That they might keep his statutes,                      And observe his laws.                      Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms|106|1|Praise ye Jehovah.                      Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good;                      For his lovingkindness {endureth} forever.

Psalms|106|6|We have sinned with our fathers,                      We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psalms|106|7|Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt;                      They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses,                      But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
Psalms|106|8|Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,                      That he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psalms|106|9|He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:                      So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
Psalms|106|10|And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them,                      And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms|106|11|And the waters covered their adversaries;                      There was not one of them left.
Psalms|106|12|Then believed they his words;                      They sang his praise.
Psalms|106|13|They soon forgat his works;                      They waited not for his counsel,
Psalms|106|14|But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,                      And tempted God in the desert.
Psalms|106|15|And he gave them their request,                      But sent leanness into their soul.
Psalms|106|16|They envied Moses also in the camp,                               {And} Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
Psalms|106|17|The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,                      And covered the company of Abiram.
Psalms|106|18|And a fire was kindled in their company;                      The flame burned up the wicked.
Psalms|106|19|They made a calf in Horeb,                      And worshipped a molten image.
Psalms|106|20|Thus they changed their glory                      For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
Psalms|106|21|They forgat God their Saviour,                      Who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalms|106|22|Wondrous works in the land of Ham,                               {And} terrible things by the Red Sea.
Psalms|106|23|Therefore he said that he would destroy them,                      Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach,                      To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy {them}.
Psalms|106|24|Yea, they despised the pleasant land,                      They believed not his word,
Psalms|106|25|But murmured in their tents,                      And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
Psalms|106|26|Therefore he sware unto them,                      That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
Psalms|106|27|And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,                      And scatter them in the lands.
Psalms|106|28|They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,                      And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psalms|106|29|Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;                      And the plague brake in upon them.
Psalms|106|30|Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment;                      And so the plague was stayed.
Psalms|106|31|And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,                      Unto all generations for evermore.
Psalms|106|32|They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,                      So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
Psalms|106|33|Because they were rebellious against his spirit,                      And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psalms|106|34|They did not destroy the peoples,                      As Jehovah commanded them,
Psalms|106|35|But mingled themselves with the nations,                      And learned their works,
Psalms|106|36|And served their idols,                      Which became a snare unto them.
Psalms|106|37|Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
Psalms|106|38|And shed innocent blood,                      Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,                      Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;                      And the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms|106|39|Thus were they defiled with their works,                      And played the harlot in their doings.
Psalms|106|40|Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,                      And he abhorred his inheritance.
Psalms|106|41|And he gave them into the hand of the nations;                      And they that hated them ruled over them.
Psalms|106|42|Their enemies also oppressed them,                      And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psalms|106|43|Many times did he deliver them;                      But they were rebellious in their counsel,                      And were brought low in their iniquity.
Psalms|106|44|Nevertheless he regarded their distress,                      When he heard their cry:
Psalms|106|45|And he remembered for them his covenant,                      And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
Psalms|106|46|He made them also to be pitied                      Of all those that carried them captive.
Psalms|106|47|Save us, O Jehovah our God,                      And gather us from among the nations,                      To give thanks unto thy holy name,                      And to triumph in thy praise.
Psalms|106|48|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,                      From everlasting even to everlasting.                      And let all the people say, Amen.                      Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms|107|1|O give thanks unto Jehovah;                      For he is good;                      For his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever.
Psalms|107|2|Let the redeemed of Jehovah say {so},                      Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
Psalms|107|3|And gathered out of the lands,                      From the east and from the west,                      From the north and from the south.

Psalms|107|8|Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness,                      And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms|107|9|For he satisfieth the longing soul,                      And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
Psalms|107|10|Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,                      Being bound in affliction and iron,
Psalms|107|11|Because they rebelled against the words of God,                      And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
Psalms|107|12|Therefore he brought down their heart with labor;                      They fell down, and there was none to help.
Psalms|107|13|Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,                      And he saved them out of their distresses.
