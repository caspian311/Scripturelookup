2 Kings|13|25|And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
2 Kings|14|1|In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|14|2|He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|14|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done.
2 Kings|14|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|14|5|And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father:
2 Kings|14|6|but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Kings|14|7|He slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.
2 Kings|14|8|Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Kings|14|9|And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Kings|14|10|Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory thereof, and abide at home; for why shouldest thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2 Kings|14|11|But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Kings|14|12|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Kings|14|13|And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Kings|14|14|And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2 Kings|14|15|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|16|And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|14|17|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Kings|14|18|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|14|19|And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Kings|14|20|And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings|14|21|And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2 Kings|14|22|He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2 Kings|14|23|In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, {and reigned} forty and one years.
2 Kings|14|24|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|14|25|He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
2 Kings|14|26|For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.
2 Kings|14|27|And Jehovah said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
2 Kings|14|28|Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, {which had belonged} to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|29|And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|1|In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|2|Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|15|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Kings|15|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|15|5|And Jehovah smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
2 Kings|15|6|Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|7|And Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|8|In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
2 Kings|15|9|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|10|And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|11|Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|12|This was the word of Jehovah which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And so it came to pass.
2 Kings|15|13|Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|14|And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|15|Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|16|Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the borders thereof, from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
2 Kings|15|17|In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, {and reigned} ten years in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|18|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|19|There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
2 Kings|15|20|And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
2 Kings|15|21|Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|15|22|And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|23|In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} two years.
2 Kings|15|24|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|25|And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|26|Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|27|In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} twenty years.
2 Kings|15|28|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|29|In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.
2 Kings|15|30|And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
2 Kings|15|31|Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|32|In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|33|Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings|15|34|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings|15|35|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|15|36|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|37|In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings|15|38|And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|16|1|In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|16|2|Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.
2 Kings|16|3|But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|16|4|And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2 Kings|16|5|Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
2 Kings|16|6|At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there, unto this day.
2 Kings|16|7|So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
2 Kings|16|8|And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|9|And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried {the people of} it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
2 Kings|16|10|And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
2 Kings|16|11|And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.
2 Kings|16|12|And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon.
2 Kings|16|13|And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.
2 Kings|16|14|And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.
2 Kings|16|15|And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king’s burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
2 Kings|16|16|Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
2 Kings|16|17|And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.
2 Kings|16|18|And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|19|Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|16|20|And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|17|1|In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, {and reigned} nine years.
2 Kings|17|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
2 Kings|17|3|Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
2 Kings|17|4|And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
2 Kings|17|5|Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
2 Kings|17|6|In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away unto Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings|17|7|And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
2 Kings|17|8|and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
2 Kings|17|9|And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Jehovah their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;
2 Kings|17|10|and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree;
2 Kings|17|11|and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Jehovah carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
2 Kings|17|12|and they served idols, whereof Jehovah had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
