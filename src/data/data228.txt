1 Corinthians|9|19|For though I was free from all {men,} I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
1 Corinthians|9|20|And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
1 Corinthians|9|21|to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.
1 Corinthians|9|22|To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
1 Corinthians|9|23|And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.
1 Corinthians|9|24|Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.
1 Corinthians|9|25|And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they {do it} to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians|9|26|I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:
1 Corinthians|9|27|but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.
1 Corinthians|10|1|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|2|and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|3|and did all eat the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians|10|4|and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians|10|5|Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians|10|6|Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1 Corinthians|10|7|Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
1 Corinthians|10|8|Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1 Corinthians|10|9|Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.
1 Corinthians|10|10|Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
1 Corinthians|10|11|Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
1 Corinthians|10|12|Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians|10|13|There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.
1 Corinthians|10|14|Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians|10|15|I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians|10|16|The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians|10|17|seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.
1 Corinthians|10|18|Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|10|19|What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
1 Corinthians|10|20|But {I say}, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.
1 Corinthians|10|21|Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
1 Corinthians|10|22|Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians|10|23|All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.
1 Corinthians|10|24|Let no man seek his own, but {each} his neighbor’s {good}.
1 Corinthians|10|25|Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake,
1 Corinthians|10|26|for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
1 Corinthians|10|27|If one of them that believe not biddeth you {to a feast}, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
1 Corinthians|10|28|But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:
1 Corinthians|10|29|conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
1 Corinthians|10|30|If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians|10|31|Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
1 Corinthians|10|32|Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:
1 Corinthians|10|33|even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the {profit} of the many, that they may be saved.
1 Corinthians|11|1|Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1 Corinthians|11|2|Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
1 Corinthians|11|3|But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
1 Corinthians|11|4|Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
1 Corinthians|11|5|But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians|11|6|For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
1 Corinthians|11|7|For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1 Corinthians|11|8|For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:
1 Corinthians|11|9|for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:
1 Corinthians|11|10|for this cause ought the woman to have {a sign of} authority on her head, because of the angels.
1 Corinthians|11|11|Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|12|For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.
1 Corinthians|11|13|Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?
1 Corinthians|11|14|Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
1 Corinthians|11|15|But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
1 Corinthians|11|16|But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1 Corinthians|11|17|But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.
1 Corinthians|11|18|For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.
1 Corinthians|11|19|For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
1 Corinthians|11|20|When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:
1 Corinthians|11|21|for in your eating each one taketh before {other} his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1 Corinthians|11|22|What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.
1 Corinthians|11|23|For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;
1 Corinthians|11|24|and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|25|In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink {it}, in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|26|For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.
1 Corinthians|11|27|Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|28|But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
1 Corinthians|11|29|For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.
1 Corinthians|11|30|For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
1 Corinthians|11|31|But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.
1 Corinthians|11|32|But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
1 Corinthians|11|33|Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.
1 Corinthians|11|34|If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.
1 Corinthians|12|1|Now concerning spiritual {gifts}, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
1 Corinthians|12|2|Ye know that when ye were Gentiles {ye were} led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.
1 Corinthians|12|3|Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|4|Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|5|And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
1 Corinthians|12|6|And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.
1 Corinthians|12|7|But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
1 Corinthians|12|8|For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:
1 Corinthians|12|9|to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;
1 Corinthians|12|10|and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; to another {divers} kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:
1 Corinthians|12|11|but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
1 Corinthians|12|12|For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
1 Corinthians|12|13|For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|14|For the body is not one member, but many.
1 Corinthians|12|15|If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|16|And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|17|If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
1 Corinthians|12|18|But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
1 Corinthians|12|19|And if they were all one member, where were the body?
1 Corinthians|12|20|But now they are many members, but one body.
1 Corinthians|12|21|And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians|12|22|Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:
1 Corinthians|12|23|and those {parts} of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely {parts} have more abundant comeliness;
1 Corinthians|12|24|whereas our comely {parts} have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that {part} which lacked;
