Ezekiel|36|26|A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel|36|27|And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.
Ezekiel|36|28|And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Ezekiel|36|29|And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.
Ezekiel|36|30|And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel|36|31|Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
Ezekiel|36|32|Nor for your sake do I {this}, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
Ezekiel|36|33|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
Ezekiel|36|34|And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.
Ezekiel|36|35|And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
Ezekiel|36|36|Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
Ezekiel|36|37|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.
Ezekiel|36|38|As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|1|The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Ezekiel|37|2|And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
Ezekiel|37|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.
Ezekiel|37|4|Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.
Ezekiel|37|6|And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|7|So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
Ezekiel|37|8|And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
Ezekiel|37|9|Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
Ezekiel|37|10|So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
Ezekiel|37|11|Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
Ezekiel|37|12|Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|37|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
Ezekiel|37|14|And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|15|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|37|16|And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and {for} all the house of Israel his companions:
Ezekiel|37|17|and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.
Ezekiel|37|18|And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?
Ezekiel|37|19|say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, {even} with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
Ezekiel|37|20|And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel|37|21|And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
Ezekiel|37|22|and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
Ezekiel|37|23|neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|37|24|And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
Ezekiel|37|25|And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their childrenâ€™s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
Ezekiel|37|26|Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
Ezekiel|37|27|My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Ezekiel|37|28|And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
Ezekiel|38|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|38|2|Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
Ezekiel|38|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|38|4|and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
Ezekiel|38|5|Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel|38|6|Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|7|Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
Ezekiel|38|8|After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
Ezekiel|38|9|And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device:
Ezekiel|38|11|and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
Ezekiel|38|12|to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are {now} inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.
Ezekiel|38|13|Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?
Ezekiel|38|14|Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?
Ezekiel|38|15|And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;
Ezekiel|38|16|and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
Ezekiel|38|17|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for {many} years that I would bring thee against them?
Ezekiel|38|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.
Ezekiel|38|19|For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|38|20|so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
Ezekiel|38|21|And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every manâ€™s sword shall be against his brother.
Ezekiel|38|22|And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
Ezekiel|38|23|And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|1|And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|39|2|and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;
Ezekiel|39|3|and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
Ezekiel|39|4|Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
Ezekiel|39|5|Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|6|And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|7|And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel|39|8|Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
Ezekiel|39|9|And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;
Ezekiel|39|10|so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|11|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|12|And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|13|Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|14|And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
Ezekiel|39|15|And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a manâ€™s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|16|And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|17|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel|39|18|Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
Ezekiel|39|19|And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
Ezekiel|39|20|And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|21|And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
Ezekiel|39|22|So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.
Ezekiel|39|23|And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
Ezekiel|39|24|According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.
Ezekiel|39|25|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
Ezekiel|39|26|And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
Ezekiel|39|27|when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemiesâ€™ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
Ezekiel|39|28|And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;
Ezekiel|39|29|neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|40|1|In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth {day} of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.
Ezekiel|40|2|In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.
Ezekiel|40|3|And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
Ezekiel|40|4|And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|40|5|And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the manâ€™s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Ezekiel|40|6|Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
Ezekiel|40|7|And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and {the space} between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.
