Numbers|1|45|So all they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
Numbers|1|46|even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers|1|47|But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
Numbers|1|48|For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|1|49|Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel;
Numbers|1|50|but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
Numbers|1|51|And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|1|52|And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
Numbers|1|53|But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
Numbers|1|54|Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.
Numbers|2|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|2|2|The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers’ houses: over against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about.

Numbers|2|16|All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth second.
Numbers|2|17|Then the tent of meeting shall set forward, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards.
Numbers|2|18|On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

Numbers|2|32|These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses: all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers|2|33|But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|2|34|Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.
Numbers|3|1|Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spake with Moses in mount Sinai.
Numbers|3|2|And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Numbers|3|3|These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.
Numbers|3|4|And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.
Numbers|3|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|6|Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.
Numbers|3|7|And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.

Numbers|3|10|And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|3|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|12|And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:
Numbers|3|13|for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am Jehovah.
Numbers|3|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Numbers|3|15|Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.
Numbers|3|16|And Moses numbered them according to the word of Jehovah, as he was commanded.
Numbers|3|17|And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
Numbers|3|18|And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
Numbers|3|19|And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

Numbers|3|24|And the prince of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.
Numbers|3|25|And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering thereof, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
Numbers|3|26|and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.
Numbers|3|27|And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.

Numbers|3|35|And the prince of the fathers’ house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: they shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle northward.
Numbers|3|36|And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the instruments thereof, and all the service thereof,
Numbers|3|37|and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.
Numbers|3|38|And those that encamp before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|3|39|All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.
Numbers|3|40|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
Numbers|3|41|And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel:
Numbers|3|42|and Moses numbered, as Jehovah commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel.
Numbers|3|43|And all the first-born males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.
Numbers|3|44|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|45|Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah.
Numbers|3|46|And for the redemption of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above {the number of} the Levites,
Numbers|3|47|thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs):
Numbers|3|48|and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.
Numbers|3|49|And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites;
Numbers|3|50|from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and five {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
Numbers|3|51|and Moses gave the redemption-money unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.

Numbers|4|3|from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|4|This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, {about} the most holy things:
Numbers|4|5|when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it,
