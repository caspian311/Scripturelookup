Leviticus|2|7|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
Leviticus|2|8|And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.
Leviticus|2|9|And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|10|And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus|2|11|No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|12|As an oblation of first-{fruits} ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
Leviticus|2|13|And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.
Leviticus|2|14|And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
Leviticus|2|15|And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus|2|16|And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|1|And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|2|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|3|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|4|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|5|And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|6|And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
Leviticus|3|7|If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;
Leviticus|3|8|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|9|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|10|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|11|And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|12|And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:
Leviticus|3|13|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|14|And he shall offer thereof his oblation, {even} an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|15|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|16|And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|3|17|It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
Leviticus|4|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|4|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:
Leviticus|4|3|if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|4|And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|5|And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|6|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|4|7|And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|8|And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|4|9|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,
Leviticus|4|10|as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|11|And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,
Leviticus|4|12|even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
Leviticus|4|13|And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
Leviticus|4|14|when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|15|And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|16|And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|17|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.
Leviticus|4|18|And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|19|And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.
Leviticus|4|20|Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|21|And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.
Leviticus|4|22|When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;
Leviticus|4|23|if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.
Leviticus|4|24|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|25|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|26|And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|27|And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;
Leviticus|4|28|if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
Leviticus|4|29|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|30|And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus|4|31|And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|32|And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
Leviticus|4|33|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|34|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:
Leviticus|4|35|and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|1|And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter {it}, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|2|Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|3|Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|4|Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these {things}.
Leviticus|5|5|And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these {things}, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:
Leviticus|5|6|and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.
Leviticus|5|7|And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|5|8|And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
Leviticus|5|9|and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|10|And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|11|But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|12|And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|13|And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and {the remnant} shall be the priest’s, as the meal-offering.
Leviticus|5|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|5|15|If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
Leviticus|5|16|and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|17|And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|18|And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|19|It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|2|If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,
Leviticus|6|3|or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;
Leviticus|6|4|then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,
Leviticus|6|5|or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.
Leviticus|6|6|And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:
Leviticus|6|7|and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.
Leviticus|6|8|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|9|Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.
Leviticus|6|10|And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
Leviticus|6|11|And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
Leviticus|6|12|And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|6|13|Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
Leviticus|6|14|And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar.
Leviticus|6|15|And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|16|And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus|6|17|It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
Leviticus|6|18|Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as {his} portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy.
Leviticus|6|19|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
