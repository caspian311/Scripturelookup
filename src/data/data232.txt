Acts|5|23|saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
Acts|5|24|Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.
Acts|5|25|And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.
Acts|5|26|Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them, {but} without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
Acts|5|27|And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
Acts|5|28|saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
Acts|5|29|But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.
Acts|5|30|The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.
Acts|5|31|Him did God exalt with his right hand {to be} a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
Acts|5|32|And we are witnesses of these things; and {so is} the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
Acts|5|33|But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and minded to slay them.
Acts|5|34|But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.
Acts|5|35|And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.
Acts|5|36|For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.
Acts|5|37|After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away {some of the} people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.
Acts|5|38|And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:
Acts|5|39|but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.
Acts|5|40|And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
Acts|5|41|They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.
Acts|5|42|And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus {as} the Christ.
Acts|6|1|Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Acts|6|2|And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.
Acts|6|3|Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
Acts|6|4|But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.
Acts|6|5|And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;
Acts|6|6|whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.
Acts|6|7|And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
Acts|6|8|And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.
Acts|6|9|But there arose certain of them that were of the synagogue called {the synagogue} of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
Acts|6|10|And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.
Acts|6|11|Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and {against} God.
Acts|6|12|And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,
Acts|6|13|and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:
Acts|6|14|for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.
Acts|6|15|And all that sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
Acts|7|1|And the high priest said, Are these things so?
Acts|7|2|And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
Acts|7|3|and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
Acts|7|4|Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, {God} removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:
Acts|7|5|and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when {as yet} he had no child.
Acts|7|6|And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.
Acts|7|7|And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
Acts|7|8|And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so {Abraham} begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac {begat} Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
Acts|7|9|And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,
Acts|7|10|and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Acts|7|11|Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
Acts|7|12|But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.
Acts|7|13|And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.
Acts|7|14|And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
Acts|7|15|And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;
Acts|7|16|and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts|7|17|But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Acts|7|18|till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Acts|7|19|The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.
Acts|7|20|At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house.
Acts|7|21|and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
Acts|7|22|And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
Acts|7|23|But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
Acts|7|24|And seeing one {of them} suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:
Acts|7|25|and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.
Acts|7|26|And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
Acts|7|27|But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts|7|28|Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
Acts|7|29|And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
Acts|7|30|And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
Acts|7|31|And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,
Acts|7|32|I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
Acts|7|33|And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Acts|7|34|I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
Acts|7|35|This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath God sent {to be} both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
Acts|7|36|This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
Acts|7|37|This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.
Acts|7|38|This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us:
Acts|7|39|to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,
Acts|7|40|saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Acts|7|41|And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
Acts|7|42|But God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,             Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices                   Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
Acts|7|43|And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,                   And the star of the god Rephan,                   The figures which ye made to worship them:                   And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Acts|7|44|Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.
Acts|7|45|Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
Acts|7|46|who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts|7|47|But Solomon built him a house.
Acts|7|48|Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in {houses} made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Acts|7|49|The heaven is my throne,                   And the earth the footstool of my feet:                   What manner of house will ye build me? saith the Lord:                   Or what is the place of my rest?
Acts|7|50|Did not my hand make all these things?
Acts|7|51|Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.
Acts|7|52|Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers;
Acts|7|53|ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
Acts|7|54|Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
Acts|7|55|But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
Acts|7|56|and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.
Acts|7|57|But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;
Acts|7|58|and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts|7|59|And they stoned Stephen, calling upon {the Lord}, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Acts|7|60|And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Acts|8|1|And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts|8|2|And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
Acts|8|3|But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.
Acts|8|4|They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.
Acts|8|5|And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.
