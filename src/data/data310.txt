Deuteronomy|32|21|They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;                   They have provoked me to anger with their vanities:                   And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people;                   I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy|32|22|For a fire is kindled in mine anger,                   And burneth unto the lowest Sheol,                   And devoureth the earth with its increase,                   And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy|32|23|I will heap evils upon them;                   I will spend mine arrows upon them:
Deuteronomy|32|24|{They shall be} wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat                   And bitter destruction;                   And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,                   With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
Deuteronomy|32|25|Without shall the sword bereave,                   And in the chambers terror;                           {It shall destroy} both young man and virgin,                   The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
Deuteronomy|32|26|I said, I would scatter them afar,                   I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
Deuteronomy|32|27|Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,                   Lest their adversaries should judge amiss,                   Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted,                   And Jehovah hath not done all this.
Deuteronomy|32|28|For they are a nation void of counsel,                   And there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy|32|29|Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,                   That they would consider their latter end!
Deuteronomy|32|30|How should one chase a thousand,                   And two put ten thousand to flight,                   Except their Rock had sold them,                   And Jehovah had delivered them up?
Deuteronomy|32|31|For their rock is not as our Rock,                   Even our enemies themselves being judges.
Deuteronomy|32|32|For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,                   And of the fields of Gomorrah:                   Their grapes are grapes of gall,                   Their clusters are bitter:
Deuteronomy|32|33|Their wine is the poison of serpents,                   And the cruel venom of asps.
Deuteronomy|32|34|Is not this laid up in store with me,                   Sealed up among my treasures?
Deuteronomy|32|35|Vengeance is mine, and recompense,                   At the time when their foot shall slide:                   For the day of their calamity is at hand,                   And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
Deuteronomy|32|36|For Jehovah will judge his people,                   And repent himself for his servants;                   When he seeth that {their} power is gone,                   And there is none {remaining}, shut up or left at large.
Deuteronomy|32|37|And he will say, Where are their gods,                   The rock in which they took refuge;
Deuteronomy|32|38|Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,                           {And} drank the wine of their drink-offering?                   Let them rise up and help you,                   Let them be your protection.
Deuteronomy|32|39|See now that I, even I, am he,                   And there is no god with me:                   I kill, and I make alive;                   I wound, and I heal;                   And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
Deuteronomy|32|40|For I lift up my hand to heaven,                   And say, As I live for ever,
Deuteronomy|32|41|If I whet my glittering sword,                   And my hand take hold on judgment;                   I will render vengeance to mine adversaries,                   And will recompense them that hate me.
Deuteronomy|32|42|I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,                   And my sword shall devour flesh;                   With the blood of the slain and the captives,                   From the head of the leaders of the enemy.
Deuteronomy|32|43|Rejoice, O ye nations, {with} his people:                   For he will avenge the blood of his servants,                    And will render vengeance to his adversaries,                   And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
Deuteronomy|32|44|And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
Deuteronomy|32|45|And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
Deuteronomy|32|46|And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, {even} all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy|32|47|For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy|32|48|And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
Deuteronomy|32|49|Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;
Deuteronomy|32|50|and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
Deuteronomy|32|51|because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|32|52|For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|33|1|And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy|33|2|And he said,             Jehovah came from Sinai,                   And rose from Seir unto them;                   He shined forth from mount Paran,                   And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones:                   At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
Deuteronomy|33|3|Yea, he loveth the people;                   All his saints are in thy hand:                   And they sat down at thy feet;                           {Every one} shall receive of thy words.
Deuteronomy|33|4|Moses commanded us a law,                   An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
Deuteronomy|33|5|And he was king in Jeshurun,                   When the heads of the people were gathered,                   All the tribes of Israel together.
Deuteronomy|33|6|Let Reuben live, and not die;                   Nor let his men be few.
Deuteronomy|33|7|And this is {the blessing} of Judah: and he said,             Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah,                   And bring him in unto his people.                   With his hands he contended for himself;                   And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.
Deuteronomy|33|8|And of Levi he said,             Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one,                   Whom thou didst prove at Massah,                   With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
Deuteronomy|33|9|Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;                   Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,                   Nor knew he his own children:                   For they have observed thy word,                   And keep thy covenant.
Deuteronomy|33|10|They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances,                   And Israel thy law:                   They shall put incense before thee,                   And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.
Deuteronomy|33|11|Bless, Jehovah, his substance,                   And accept the work of his hands:                   Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,                   And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
Deuteronomy|33|12|Of Benjamin he said,             The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him;                   He covereth him all the day long,                   And he dwelleth between his shoulders.
Deuteronomy|33|13|And of Joseph he said,             Blessed of Jehovah be his land,                   For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,                   And for the deep that coucheth beneath,
Deuteronomy|33|14|And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,                   And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
Deuteronomy|33|15|And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,                   And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
Deuteronomy|33|16|And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,                   And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.                   Let {the blessing} come upon the head of Joseph,                   And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Deuteronomy|33|17|The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;                   And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox:                   With them he shall push the peoples all of them, {even} the ends of the earth:                   And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,                   And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
Deuteronomy|33|18|And of Zebulun he said,             Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;                   And, Issachar, in thy tents.
Deuteronomy|33|19|They shall call the peoples unto the mountain;                   There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness:                   For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,                   And the hidden treasures of the sand.
Deuteronomy|33|20|And of Gad he said,             Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:                   He dwelleth as a lioness,                   And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
Deuteronomy|33|21|And he provided the first part for himself,                   For there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved;                   And he came {with} the heads of the people;                   He executed the righteousness of Jehovah,                   And his ordinances with Israel.

Deuteronomy|33|23|And of Naphtali he said,             O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,                   And full with the blessing of Jehovah,                   Possess thou the west and the south.
Deuteronomy|33|24|And of Asher he said,             Blessed be Asher with children;                   Let him be acceptable unto his brethren,                   And let him dip his foot in oil.

And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee;                   And thou shalt tread upon their high places.
Deuteronomy|34|1|And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
Deuteronomy|34|2|and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea,
Deuteronomy|34|3|and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar.
Deuteronomy|34|4|And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
Deuteronomy|34|5|So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|34|6|And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
Deuteronomy|34|7|And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

Deuteronomy|34|11|in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
Deuteronomy|34|12|and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
1 John|1|1|That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life
1 John|1|2|(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal {life}, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us);
1 John|1|3|that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:
1 John|1|4|and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.
1 John|1|5|And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1 John|1|6|If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
1 John|1|7|but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1 John|1|8|If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
1 John|1|9|If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 John|1|10|If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1 John|2|1|My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
1 John|2|2|and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
1 John|2|3|And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1 John|2|4|He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
1 John|2|5|but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:
1 John|2|6|he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
1 John|2|7|Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.
1 John|2|8|Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.
1 John|2|9|He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
1 John|2|10|He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
1 John|2|11|But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1 John|2|12|I write unto you, {my} little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
1 John|2|13|I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.
1 John|2|14|I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.
1 John|2|15|Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
1 John|2|16|For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
1 John|2|17|And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
