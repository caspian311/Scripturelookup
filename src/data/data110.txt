Judges|14|15|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to impoverish us? is it not {so}?
Judges|14|16|And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?
Judges|14|17|And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
Judges|14|18|And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them,             If ye had not plowed with my heifer,                   Ye had not found out my riddle.
Judges|14|19|And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes {of raiment} unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.
Judges|14|20|But Samson’s wife was {given} to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
Judges|15|1|But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
Judges|15|2|And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
Judges|15|3|And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
Judges|15|4|And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
Judges|15|5|And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.
Judges|15|6|Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
Judges|15|7|And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
Judges|15|8|And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
Judges|15|9|Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
Judges|15|10|And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
Judges|15|11|Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
Judges|15|12|And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
Judges|15|13|And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
Judges|15|14|When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
Judges|15|15|And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.
Judges|15|16|And Samson said,             With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,                   With the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men.
Judges|15|17|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
Judges|15|18|And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.
Judges|15|19|But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.
Judges|15|20|And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
Judges|16|1|And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her.
Judges|16|2|{And it was told} the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, {Let be} till morning light, then we will kill him.
Judges|16|3|And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
Judges|16|4|And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
Judges|16|5|And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred {pieces} of silver.
Judges|16|6|And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
Judges|16|7|And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|8|Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
Judges|16|9|Now she had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withes, as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
Judges|16|10|And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
Judges|16|11|And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|12|So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he brake them off his arms like a thread.
Judges|16|13|And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
Judges|16|14|And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
Judges|16|15|And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
Judges|16|16|And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death.
Judges|16|17|And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
Judges|16|18|And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.
Judges|16|19|And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
Judges|16|20|And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
Judges|16|21|And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
Judges|16|22|Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
Judges|16|23|And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
Judges|16|24|And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.
Judges|16|25|And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:
Judges|16|26|and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.
Judges|16|27|Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
Judges|16|28|And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
Judges|16|29|And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
Judges|16|30|And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life.
Judges|16|31|Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
Judges|17|1|And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges|17|2|And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred {pieces} of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah.
Judges|17|3|And he restored the eleven hundred {pieces} of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
Judges|17|4|And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred {pieces} of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|5|And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
Judges|17|6|In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
Judges|17|7|And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
Judges|17|8|And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find {a place}, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
Judges|17|9|And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find {a place}.
Judges|17|10|And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten {pieces} of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
Judges|17|11|And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges|17|12|And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|13|Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
Judges|18|1|In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day {their} inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges|18|2|And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.
Judges|18|3|When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
Judges|18|4|And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.
Judges|18|5|And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
Judges|18|6|And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before Jehovah is your way wherein ye go.
Judges|18|7|Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put {them} to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
Judges|18|8|And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What {say} ye?
Judges|18|9|And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
Judges|18|10|When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and the land is large; for God hath given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
Judges|18|11|And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|12|And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.
Judges|18|13|And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
Judges|18|14|Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
Judges|18|15|And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
Judges|18|16|And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
Judges|18|17|And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|18|And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?
Judges|18|19|And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
Judges|18|20|And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
Judges|18|21|So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
Judges|18|22|When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
Judges|18|23|And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
Judges|18|24|And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?
Judges|18|25|And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
Judges|18|26|And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
Judges|18|27|And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
Judges|18|28|And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.
Judges|18|29|And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
Judges|18|30|And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
