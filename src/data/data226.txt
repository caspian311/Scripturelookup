Galatians|6|14|But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Galatians|6|15|For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Galatians|6|16|And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace {be} upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Galatians|6|17|Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.
Galatians|6|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
1 Corinthians|1|1|Paul, called {to be} an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
1 Corinthians|1|2|unto the church of God which is at Corinth, {even} them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called {to be} saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their {Lord} and ours:
1 Corinthians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|4|I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
1 Corinthians|1|5|that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;
1 Corinthians|1|6|even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians|1|7|so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
1 Corinthians|1|8|who shall also confirm you unto the end, {that ye be} unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|9|God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians|1|10|Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and {that} there be no divisions among you; but {that} ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
1 Corinthians|1|11|For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them {that are of the household} of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1 Corinthians|1|12|Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|13|Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians|1|14|I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;
1 Corinthians|1|15|lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.
1 Corinthians|1|16|And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1 Corinthians|1|17|For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.
1 Corinthians|1|18|For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians|1|19|For it is written,             I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,                   And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.
1 Corinthians|1|20|Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1 Corinthians|1|21|For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.
1 Corinthians|1|22|Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:
1 Corinthians|1|23|but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;
1 Corinthians|1|24|but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
1 Corinthians|1|25|Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians|1|26|For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, {are called}:
1 Corinthians|1|27|but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
1 Corinthians|1|28|and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did God choose, {yea} and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:
1 Corinthians|1|29|that no flesh should glory before God.
1 Corinthians|1|30|But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
1 Corinthians|1|31|that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|2|1|And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
1 Corinthians|2|2|For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
1 Corinthians|2|3|And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
1 Corinthians|2|4|And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
1 Corinthians|2|5|that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1 Corinthians|2|6|We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:
1 Corinthians|2|7|but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, {even} the {wisdom} that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:
1 Corinthians|2|8|which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:
1 Corinthians|2|9|but as it is written,             Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not,                   And {which} entered not into the heart of man,                   Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him.
1 Corinthians|2|10|But unto us God revealed {them} through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
1 Corinthians|2|11|For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians|2|12|But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.
1 Corinthians|2|13|Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual {words}.
1 Corinthians|2|14|Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.
1 Corinthians|2|15|But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.
1 Corinthians|2|16|For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|1|And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|2|I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able {to bear it}: nay, not even now are ye able;
1 Corinthians|3|3|for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?
1 Corinthians|3|4|For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
1 Corinthians|3|5|What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
1 Corinthians|3|6|I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|7|So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|8|Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
1 Corinthians|3|9|For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.
1 Corinthians|3|10|According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
1 Corinthians|3|11|For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|12|But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
1 Corinthians|3|13|each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.
1 Corinthians|3|14|If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
1 Corinthians|3|15|If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
1 Corinthians|3|16|Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and {that} the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1 Corinthians|3|17|If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
1 Corinthians|3|18|Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
1 Corinthians|3|19|For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:
1 Corinthians|3|20|and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.
1 Corinthians|3|21|Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|22|whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|23|and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
1 Corinthians|4|1|Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1 Corinthians|4|2|Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1 Corinthians|4|3|But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
1 Corinthians|4|4|For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
1 Corinthians|4|5|Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.
1 Corinthians|4|6|Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not {to go} beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.
1 Corinthians|4|7|For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?
1 Corinthians|4|8|Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1 Corinthians|4|9|For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.
1 Corinthians|4|10|We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.
1 Corinthians|4|11|Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;
1 Corinthians|4|12|and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;
1 Corinthians|4|13|being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.
1 Corinthians|4|14|I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
1 Corinthians|4|15|For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet {have ye} not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.
1 Corinthians|4|16|I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
1 Corinthians|4|17|For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.
1 Corinthians|4|18|Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
1 Corinthians|4|19|But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.
1 Corinthians|4|20|For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1 Corinthians|4|21|What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
1 Corinthians|5|1|It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one {of you} hath his father’s wife.
1 Corinthians|5|2|And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1 Corinthians|5|3|For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,
1 Corinthians|5|4|in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
