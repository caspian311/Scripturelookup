2 Samuel|19|17|And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.
2 Samuel|19|18|And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|19|And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
2 Samuel|19|20|For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
2 Samuel|19|21|But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed?
2 Samuel|19|22|And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
2 Samuel|19|23|And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.
2 Samuel|19|24|And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
2 Samuel|19|25|And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
2 Samuel|19|26|And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.
2 Samuel|19|27|And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
2 Samuel|19|28|For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?
2 Samuel|19|29|And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
2 Samuel|19|30|And Mephibosheth said unto the king, yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.
2 Samuel|19|31|And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|32|Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
2 Samuel|19|33|And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|19|34|And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
2 Samuel|19|35|I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2 Samuel|19|36|Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2 Samuel|19|37|Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
2 Samuel|19|38|And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
2 Samuel|19|39|And all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over: and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
2 Samuel|19|40|So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|19|41|And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?
2 Samuel|19|42|And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?
2 Samuel|19|43|And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more {right} in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel|20|1|And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
2 Samuel|20|2|So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|20|3|And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2 Samuel|20|4|Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.
2 Samuel|20|5|So Amasa went to call {the men of} Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2 Samuel|20|6|And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.
2 Samuel|20|7|And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|8|When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
2 Samuel|20|9|And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
2 Samuel|20|10|But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.      And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|11|And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.
2 Samuel|20|12|And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
2 Samuel|20|13|When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|14|And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
2 Samuel|20|15|And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
2 Samuel|20|16|Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
2 Samuel|20|17|And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
2 Samuel|20|18|Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask {counsel} at Abel: and so they ended {the matter}.
2 Samuel|20|19|I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|20|20|And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
2 Samuel|20|21|The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
2 Samuel|20|22|Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
2 Samuel|20|23|Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
2 Samuel|20|24|and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
2 Samuel|20|25|and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
2 Samuel|20|26|and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister unto David.
2 Samuel|21|1|And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
2 Samuel|21|2|And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);
2 Samuel|21|3|and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|21|4|And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
2 Samuel|21|5|And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, {that} we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
2 Samuel|21|6|let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king said, I will give them.
2 Samuel|21|7|But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
2 Samuel|21|8|But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
2 Samuel|21|9|And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Jehovah, and they fell {all} seven together. And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
2 Samuel|21|10|And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
2 Samuel|21|11|And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
2 Samuel|21|12|And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;
2 Samuel|21|13|and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
2 Samuel|21|14|And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
2 Samuel|21|15|And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;
2 Samuel|21|16|and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred {shekels} of brass in weight, he being girded with a new {sword}, thought to have slain David.
2 Samuel|21|17|But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.
2 Samuel|21|18|And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
2 Samuel|21|19|And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
2 Samuel|21|20|And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
2 Samuel|21|21|And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.
2 Samuel|21|22|These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
2 Samuel|22|1|And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
2 Samuel|22|2|and he said,             Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;
2 Samuel|22|3|God, my rock, in him will I take refuge;                   My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;                   My saviour, thou savest me from violence.
2 Samuel|22|4|I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised:                   So shall I be saved from mine enemies.
2 Samuel|22|5|For the waves of death compassed me;                   The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:
2 Samuel|22|6|The cords of Sheol were round about me;                   The snares of death came upon me.
2 Samuel|22|7|In my distress I called upon Jehovah;                   Yea, I called unto my God:                   And he heard my voice out of his temple,                   And my cry {came} into his ears.
2 Samuel|22|8|Then the earth shook and trembled,                   The foundations of heaven quaked                   And were shaken, because he was wroth.
2 Samuel|22|9|There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,                   And fire out of his mouth devoured:                   Coals were kindled by it.
2 Samuel|22|10|He bowed the heavens also, and came down;                   And thick darkness was under his feet.
2 Samuel|22|11|And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly;                   Yea, he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
2 Samuel|22|12|And he made darkness pavilions round about him,                   Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
2 Samuel|22|13|At the brightness before him                   Coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel|22|14|Jehovah thundered from heaven,                   And the Most High uttered his voice.
2 Samuel|22|15|And he sent out arrows, and scattered them;                   Lightning, and discomfited them.
2 Samuel|22|16|Then the channels of the sea appeared,                   The foundations of the world were laid bare,                   By the rebuke of Jehovah,                   At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
2 Samuel|22|17|He sent from on high, he took me;                   He drew me out of many waters;
2 Samuel|22|18|He delivered me from my strong enemy,                   From them that hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
2 Samuel|22|19|They came upon me in the day of my calamity;                   But Jehovah was my stay.
2 Samuel|22|20|He brought me forth also into a large place;                   He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
2 Samuel|22|21|Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness;                   According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
2 Samuel|22|22|For I have kept the ways of Jehovah,                   And have not wickedly departed from my God.
2 Samuel|22|23|For all his ordinances were before me;                   And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
2 Samuel|22|24|I was also perfect toward him;                   And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
2 Samuel|22|25|Therefore hath Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness,                   According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
