Revelation|22|14|Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right {to come} to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.
Revelation|22|15|Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.
Revelation|22|16|I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.
Revelation|22|17|And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.
Revelation|22|18|I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:
Revelation|22|19|and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
Revelation|22|20|He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation|22|21|The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.
Jude|1|1|Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude|1|2|Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.
Jude|1|3|Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.
Jude|1|4|For there are certain men crept in privily, {even} they who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude|1|5|Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
Jude|1|6|And angels that kept not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jude|1|7|Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
Jude|1|8|Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at dignities.
Jude|1|9|But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
Jude|1|10|But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in these things are they destroyed.
Jude|1|11|Woe unto them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
Jude|1|12|These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
Jude|1|13|Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved forever.
Jude|1|14|And to these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
Jude|1|15|to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Jude|1|16|These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth speaketh great swelling {words}), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.
Jude|1|17|But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Jude|1|18|That they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.
Jude|1|19|These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit.
Jude|1|20|But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude|1|21|keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude|1|22|And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;
Jude|1|23|and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jude|1|24|Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy,
Jude|1|25|to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, {be} glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen.
Haggai|1|1|In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
Haggai|1|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time {for us} to come, the time for Jehovah’s house to be built.
Haggai|1|3|Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|1|4|Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth waste?
Haggai|1|5|Now therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|6|Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages {to put it} into a bag with holes.
Haggai|1|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|8|Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|9|Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.
Haggai|1|10|Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.
Haggai|1|11|And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
Haggai|1|12|Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people did fear before Jehovah.
Haggai|1|13|Then spake Haggai Jehovah’s messenger in Jehovah’s message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|14|And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,
Haggai|1|15|in the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth {month}, in the second year of Darius the king.
Haggai|2|1|In the seventh {month}, in the one and twentieth {day} of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|2|Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
Haggai|2|3|Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?
Haggai|2|4|Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts,
Haggai|2|5|{according to} the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you: fear ye not.
Haggai|2|6|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
Haggai|2|7|and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|8|The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|9|The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|10|In the four and twentieth {day} of the ninth {month}, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|11|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
Haggai|2|12|If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
Haggai|2|13|Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
Haggai|2|14|Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
Haggai|2|15|And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.
Haggai|2|16|Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty {measures}, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty {vessels}, there were but twenty.
Haggai|2|17|I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands; yet ye {turned} not to me, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|2|18|Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth {month}, since the day that the foundation of Jehovah’s temple was laid, consider it.
Haggai|2|19|Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day will I bless {you}.
Haggai|2|20|And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai in the four and twentieth {day} of the month, saying,
Haggai|2|21|Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
Haggai|2|22|and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
Haggai|2|23|In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith Jehovah, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Obadiah|1|1|The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, {saying}, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
Obadiah|1|2|Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised.
Obadiah|1|3|The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
Obadiah|1|4|Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.
Obadiah|1|5|If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night (how art thou cut off!), would they not steal {only} till they had enough? if grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
Obadiah|1|6|How are {the things of} Esau searched! how are his hidden treasures sought out!
Obadiah|1|7|All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee on thy way, even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; {they that eat} thy bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding in him.
Obadiah|1|8|Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
Obadiah|1|9|And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
Obadiah|1|10|For the violence done to thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
Obadiah|1|11|In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
Obadiah|1|12|But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|13|Enter not into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, look not thou on their affliction in the day of their calamity, neither lay ye {hands} on their substance in the day of their calamity.
Obadiah|1|14|And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|15|For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
Obadiah|1|16|For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
Obadiah|1|17|But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
Obadiah|1|18|And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Obadiah|1|19|And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, and they of the lowland the Philistines; and they shall possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria; and Benjamin {shall possess} Gilead.
Obadiah|1|20|And the captives of this host of the children of Israel, that are {among} the Canaanites, {shall possess} even unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, that are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.
Obadiah|1|21|And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Jehovah’s.
Amos|1|1|The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
Amos|1|2|And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
Amos|1|3|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
Amos|1|4|but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Amos|1|5|And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.
Amos|1|6|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:
Amos|1|7|but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
Amos|1|8|And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.
