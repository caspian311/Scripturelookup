Numbers|35|4|And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
Numbers|35|5|And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
Numbers|35|6|And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.
Numbers|35|7|All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities; them {shall ye give} with their suburbs.
Numbers|35|8|And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.
Numbers|35|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|35|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers|35|11|then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|12|And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
Numbers|35|13|And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|14|Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|15|For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|16|But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|17|And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|18|Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|19|The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
Numbers|35|20|And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
Numbers|35|21|or in enmity smote him with his hand, so that he died; he that smote him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him.
Numbers|35|22|But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,
Numbers|35|23|or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;
Numbers|35|24|then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;
Numbers|35|25|and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers|35|26|But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,
Numbers|35|27|and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,
Numbers|35|28|because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
Numbers|35|29|And these things shall be for a statute {and} ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers|35|30|Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
Numbers|35|31|Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|32|And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
Numbers|35|33|So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
Numbers|35|34|And thou shalt not defile the land which ye inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell: for I, Jehovah, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.
Numbers|36|1|And the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ {houses} of the children of Israel:
Numbers|36|2|and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
Numbers|36|3|And if they be married to any of the sons of the {other} tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
Numbers|36|4|And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
Numbers|36|5|And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.
Numbers|36|6|This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.
Numbers|36|7|So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers|36|8|And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers|36|9|So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave every one to his own inheritance.
Numbers|36|10|Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
Numbers|36|11|for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons.
Numbers|36|12|They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
Numbers|36|13|These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded by Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Exodus|1|1|Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):
Exodus|1|2|Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Exodus|1|3|Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exodus|1|4|Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus|1|5|And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exodus|1|6|And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
Exodus|1|7|And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
Exodus|1|8|Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Exodus|1|9|And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Exodus|1|10|come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
Exodus|1|11|Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus|1|12|But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
Exodus|1|13|And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:
Exodus|1|14|and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.
Exodus|1|15|And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
Exodus|1|16|and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
Exodus|1|17|But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.
Exodus|1|18|And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?
Exodus|1|19|And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.
Exodus|1|20|And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
Exodus|1|21|And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.
Exodus|1|22|And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
Exodus|2|1|And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
Exodus|2|2|And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
Exodus|2|3|And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
Exodus|2|4|And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
Exodus|2|5|And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
Exodus|2|6|And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
Exodus|2|7|Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
Exodus|2|8|And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.
Exodus|2|9|And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
Exodus|2|10|And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
Exodus|2|11|And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
Exodus|2|12|And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
Exodus|2|13|And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
Exodus|2|14|And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
Exodus|2|15|Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
Exodus|2|16|Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus|2|17|And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
Exodus|2|18|And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?
Exodus|2|19|And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
Exodus|2|20|And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
Exodus|2|21|And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus|2|22|And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
Exodus|2|23|And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
Exodus|2|24|And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
Exodus|2|25|And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge {of them}.
Exodus|3|1|Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.
Exodus|3|2|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
Exodus|3|3|And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Exodus|3|4|And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
Exodus|3|5|And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Exodus|3|6|Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
Exodus|3|7|And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
Exodus|3|8|and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus|3|9|And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
