The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;                           {Yea}, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Song of Songs|6|10|Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,                   Fair as the moon,                   Clear as the sun,                   Terrible as an army with banners?
Song of Songs|6|11|I went down into the garden of nuts,                   To see the green plants of the valley,                   To see whether the vine budded,                           {And} the pomegranates were in flower.

Song of Songs|7|13|The mandrakes give forth fragrance;                   And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,                   Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
Song of Songs|8|1|Oh that thou wert as my brother,                   That sucked the breasts of my mother!                           {When} I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;                   Yea, and none would despise me.
Song of Songs|8|2|I would lead thee, {and} bring thee into my mother’s house,                   Who would instruct me;                   I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,                   Of the juice of my pomegranate.
Song of Songs|8|3|His left hand {should be} under my head,                   And his right hand should embrace me.

Song of Songs|8|5|Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,                   Leaning upon her beloved?                                      Under the apple-tree I awakened thee:                   There thy mother was in travail with thee,                   There was she in travail that brought thee forth.
Song of Songs|8|6|Set me as a seal upon thy heart,                   As a seal upon thine arm:                   For love is strong as death;                   Jealousy is cruel as Sheol;                   The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,                   A very flame of Jehovah.
Song of Songs|8|7|Many waters cannot quench love,                   Neither can floods drown it:                   If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,                   He would utterly be contemned.
Song of Songs|8|8|We have a little sister,                   And she hath no breasts:                   What shall we do for our sister                   In the day when she shall be spoken for?
Song of Songs|8|9|If she be a wall,                   We will build upon her a turret of silver:                   And if she be a door,                   We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
Song of Songs|8|10|I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers {thereof}                   Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
Song of Songs|8|11|Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;                   He let out the vineyard unto keepers;                   Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand {pieces} of silver.
Song of Songs|8|12|My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:                   Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,                   And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
Song of Songs|8|13|Thou that dwellest in the gardens,                   The companions hearken for thy voice:                   Cause me to hear it.
Song of Songs|8|14|Make haste, my beloved,                   And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart                   Upon the mountains of spices.
2 Chronicles|1|1|And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
2 Chronicles|1|2|And Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ {houses}.
2 Chronicles|1|3|So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles|1|4|But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to {the place} that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|5|Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.
2 Chronicles|1|6|And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
2 Chronicles|1|7|In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
2 Chronicles|1|8|And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.
2 Chronicles|1|9|Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
2 Chronicles|1|10|Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
2 Chronicles|1|11|And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
2 Chronicles|1|12|wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.
2 Chronicles|1|13|So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles|1|14|And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|15|And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
2 Chronicles|1|16|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
2 Chronicles|1|17|And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
2 Chronicles|2|1|Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|2|And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
2 Chronicles|2|3|And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein, {even so deal with me}.
2 Chronicles|2|4|Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is {an ordinance} for ever to Israel.
2 Chronicles|2|5|And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
2 Chronicles|2|6|But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
2 Chronicles|2|7|Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that knoweth how to grave {all manner of} gravings, {to be} with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
2 Chronicles|2|8|Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
2 Chronicles|2|9|even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
