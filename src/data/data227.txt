1 Corinthians|5|5|to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1 Corinthians|5|6|Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians|5|7|Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, {even} Christ:
1 Corinthians|5|8|wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians|5|9|I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;
1 Corinthians|5|10|not at all {meaning} with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:
1 Corinthians|5|11|but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.
1 Corinthians|5|12|For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians|5|13|But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
1 Corinthians|6|1|Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
1 Corinthians|6|2|Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1 Corinthians|6|3|Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians|6|4|If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?
1 Corinthians|6|5|I say {this} to move you to shame. What, cannot there be {found} among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,
1 Corinthians|6|6|but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
1 Corinthians|6|7|Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?
1 Corinthians|6|8|Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that {your} brethren.
1 Corinthians|6|9|Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,
1 Corinthians|6|10|nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians|6|11|And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians|6|12|All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1 Corinthians|6|13|Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
1 Corinthians|6|14|and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.
1 Corinthians|6|15|Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.
1 Corinthians|6|16|Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.
1 Corinthians|6|17|But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians|6|18|Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1 Corinthians|6|19|Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;
1 Corinthians|6|20|for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.
1 Corinthians|7|1|Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians|7|2|But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
1 Corinthians|7|3|Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians|7|4|The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.
1 Corinthians|7|5|Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.
1 Corinthians|7|6|But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
1 Corinthians|7|7|Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1 Corinthians|7|8|But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1 Corinthians|7|9|But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1 Corinthians|7|10|But unto the married I give charge, {yea} not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband
1 Corinthians|7|11|(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.
1 Corinthians|7|12|But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
1 Corinthians|7|13|And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|14|For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1 Corinthians|7|15|Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such {cases}: but God hath called us in peace.
1 Corinthians|7|16|For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1 Corinthians|7|17|Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.
1 Corinthians|7|18|Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians|7|19|Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1 Corinthians|7|20|Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians|7|21|Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use {it} rather.
1 Corinthians|7|22|For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.
1 Corinthians|7|23|Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.
1 Corinthians|7|24|Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
1 Corinthians|7|25|Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.
1 Corinthians|7|26|I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, {namely,} that it is good for a man to be as he is.
1 Corinthians|7|27|Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians|7|28|But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.
1 Corinthians|7|29|But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;
1 Corinthians|7|30|and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;
1 Corinthians|7|31|and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
1 Corinthians|7|32|But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
1 Corinthians|7|33|but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
1 Corinthians|7|34|and is divided. {So} also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|35|And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1 Corinthians|7|36|But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin {daughter}, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.
1 Corinthians|7|37|But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin {daughter}, shall do well.
1 Corinthians|7|38|So then both he that giveth his own virgin {daughter} in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.
1 Corinthians|7|39|A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|7|40|But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians|8|1|Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
1 Corinthians|8|2|If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;
1 Corinthians|8|3|but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.
1 Corinthians|8|4|Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is {anything} in the world, and that there is no God but one.
1 Corinthians|8|5|For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
1 Corinthians|8|6|yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
1 Corinthians|8|7|Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as {of} a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians|8|8|But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
1 Corinthians|8|9|But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.
1 Corinthians|8|10|For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
1 Corinthians|8|11|For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
1 Corinthians|8|12|And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians|8|13|Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.
1 Corinthians|9|1|Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians|9|2|If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|9|3|My defence to them that examine me is this.
1 Corinthians|9|4|Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians|9|5|Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
1 Corinthians|9|6|Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?
1 Corinthians|9|7|What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians|9|8|Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?
1 Corinthians|9|9|For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,
1 Corinthians|9|10|or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, {to thresh} in hope of partaking.
1 Corinthians|9|11|If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?
1 Corinthians|9|12|If others partake of {this} right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians|9|13|Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat {of} the things of the temple, {and} they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|9|14|Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|15|But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for {it were} good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.
1 Corinthians|9|16|For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|17|For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.
1 Corinthians|9|18|What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.
