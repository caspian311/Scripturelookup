Luke|8|49|While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogueâ€™s {house}, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
Luke|8|50|But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.
Luke|8|51|And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.
Luke|8|52|And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.
Luke|8|53|And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
Luke|8|54|But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.
Luke|8|55|And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that {something} be given her to eat.
Luke|8|56|And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.
Luke|9|1|And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
Luke|9|2|And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luke|9|3|And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.
Luke|9|4|And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.
Luke|9|5|And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luke|9|6|And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.
Luke|9|7|Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;
Luke|9|8|and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
Luke|9|9|And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
Luke|9|10|And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.
Luke|9|11|But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.
Luke|9|12|And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
Luke|9|13|But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.
Luke|9|14|For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
Luke|9|15|And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Luke|9|16|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luke|9|17|And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
Luke|9|18|And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
Luke|9|19|And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others {say}, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
Luke|9|20|And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
Luke|9|21|But he charged them, and commanded {them} to tell this to no man;
Luke|9|22|saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Luke|9|23|And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
Luke|9|24|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
Luke|9|25|For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
Luke|9|26|For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and {the glory} of the Father, and of the holy angels.
Luke|9|27|But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|28|And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
Luke|9|29|And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment {became} white {and} dazzling.
Luke|9|30|And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;
Luke|9|31|who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke|9|32|Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luke|9|33|And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
Luke|9|34|And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
Luke|9|35|And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.
Luke|9|36|And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
Luke|9|37|And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
Luke|9|38|And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:
Luke|9|39|and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.
Luke|9|40|And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
Luke|9|41|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.
Luke|9|42|And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare {him} grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
Luke|9|43|And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,
Luke|9|44|Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.
Luke|9|45|But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
Luke|9|46|And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
Luke|9|47|But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
Luke|9|48|and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
Luke|9|49|And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.
Luke|9|50|But Jesus said unto him, Forbid {him} not: for he that is not against you is for you.
Luke|9|51|And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luke|9|52|and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luke|9|53|And they did not receive him, because his face was {as though he were} going to Jerusalem.
Luke|9|54|And when his disciples James and John saw {this}, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?
Luke|9|55|But he turned, and rebuked them.
Luke|9|56|And they went to another village.
Luke|9|57|And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Luke|9|58|And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven {have} nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Luke|9|59|And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Luke|9|60|But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|61|And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.
Luke|9|62|But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luke|10|1|Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.
Luke|10|2|And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
Luke|10|3|Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Luke|10|4|Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.
Luke|10|5|And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace {be} to this house.
Luke|10|6|And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.
Luke|10|7|And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
Luke|10|8|And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
Luke|10|9|and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luke|10|10|But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,
Luke|10|11|Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.
Luke|10|12|I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Luke|10|13|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke|10|14|But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
Luke|10|15|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.
Luke|10|16|He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
Luke|10|17|And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.
Luke|10|18|And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.
Luke|10|19|Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.
Luke|10|20|Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
Luke|10|21|In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Luke|10|22|All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal {him}.
Luke|10|23|And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed {are} the eyes which see the things that ye see:
Luke|10|24|for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Luke|10|25|And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|10|26|And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
Luke|10|27|And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
Luke|10|28|And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
Luke|10|29|But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Luke|10|30|Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
