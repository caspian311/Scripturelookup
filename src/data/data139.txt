Romans|6|12|Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:
Romans|6|13|neither present your members unto sin {as} instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members {as} instruments of righteousness unto God.
Romans|6|14|For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
Romans|6|15|What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.
Romans|6|16|Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves {as} servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Romans|6|17|But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;
Romans|6|18|and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.
Romans|6|19|I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members {as} servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members {as} servants to righteousness unto sanctification.
Romans|6|20|For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.
Romans|6|21|What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
Romans|6|22|But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
Romans|6|23|For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|7|1|Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?
Romans|7|2|For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
Romans|7|3|So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.
Romans|7|4|Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, {even} to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.
Romans|7|5|For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
Romans|7|6|But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
Romans|7|7|What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:
Romans|7|8|but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin {is} dead.
Romans|7|9|And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;
Romans|7|10|and the commandment, which {was} unto life, this I found {to be} unto death:
Romans|7|11|for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.
Romans|7|12|So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
Romans|7|13|Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
Romans|7|14|For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Romans|7|15|For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.
Romans|7|16|But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.
Romans|7|17|So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|18|For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good {is} not.
Romans|7|19|For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.
Romans|7|20|But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|21|I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.
Romans|7|22|For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
Romans|7|23|but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
Romans|7|24|Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?
Romans|7|25|I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
Romans|8|1|There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
Romans|8|2|For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans|8|3|For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
Romans|8|4|that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Romans|8|5|For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
Romans|8|6|For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:
Romans|8|7|because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:
Romans|8|8|and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans|8|9|But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Romans|8|10|And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans|8|11|But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
Romans|8|12|So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
Romans|8|13|for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
Romans|8|14|For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
Romans|8|15|For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
Romans|8|16|The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:
Romans|8|17|and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with {him}, that we may be also glorified with {him}.
Romans|8|18|For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.
Romans|8|19|For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans|8|20|For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope
Romans|8|21|that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
Romans|8|22|For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
Romans|8|23|And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for {our} adoption, {to wit}, the redemption of our body.
Romans|8|24|For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?
Romans|8|25|But if we hope for that which we see not, {then} do we with patience wait for it.
Romans|8|26|And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for {us} with groanings which cannot be uttered;
Romans|8|27|and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to {the will of} God.
Romans|8|28|And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, {even} to them that are called according to {his} purpose.
Romans|8|29|For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained {to be} conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:
Romans|8|30|and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
Romans|8|31|What then shall we say to these things? If God {is} for us, who {is} against us?
Romans|8|32|He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
Romans|8|33|Who shall lay anything to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? It is God that justifieth;
Romans|8|34|who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
Romans|8|35|Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Romans|8|36|Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Romans|8|37|Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Romans|8|38|For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans|8|39|nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|9|1|I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
Romans|9|2|that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans|9|3|For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethrenâ€™s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Romans|9|4|who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service {of God}, and the promises;
Romans|9|5|whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|9|6|But {it is} not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:
Romans|9|7|neither, because they are Abrahamâ€™s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Romans|9|8|That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.
Romans|9|9|For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
Romans|9|10|And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, {even} by our father Isaac--
Romans|9|11|for {the children} being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,
Romans|9|12|it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
Romans|9|13|Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.
Romans|9|14|What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
Romans|9|15|For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
Romans|9|16|So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.
Romans|9|17|For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.
Romans|9|18|So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth.
Romans|9|19|Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?
Romans|9|20|Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?
Romans|9|21|Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
Romans|9|22|What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:
Romans|9|23|and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,
Romans|9|24|{even} us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
