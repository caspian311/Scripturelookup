Psalms|78|34|When he slew them, then they inquired after him;                      And they returned and sought God earnestly.
Psalms|78|35|And they remembered that God was their rock,                      And the Most High God their redeemer.
Psalms|78|36|But they flattered him with their mouth,                      And lied unto him with their tongue.
Psalms|78|37|For their heart was not right with him,                      Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
Psalms|78|38|But he, being merciful, forgave {their} iniquity, and destroyed {them} not:                      Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,                      And did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalms|78|39|And he remembered that they were but flesh,                      A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalms|78|40|How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,                      And grieve him in the desert!
Psalms|78|41|And they turned again and tempted God,                      And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms|78|42|They remember not his hand,                      Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
Psalms|78|43|How he set his signs in Egypt,                      And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
Psalms|78|44|And turned their rivers into blood,                      And their streams, so that they could not drink.
Psalms|78|45|He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;                      And frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms|78|46|He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,                      And their labor unto the locust.
Psalms|78|47|He destroyed their vines with hail,                      And their sycomore-trees with frost.
Psalms|78|48|He gave over their cattle also to the hail,                      And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms|78|49|He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,                      Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,                      A band of angels of evil.
Psalms|78|50|He made a path for his anger;                      He spared not their soul from death,                      But gave their life over to the pestilence,
Psalms|78|51|And smote all the first-born in Egypt,                      The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms|78|52|But he led forth his own people like sheep,                      And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms|78|53|And he led them safely, so that they feared not;                      But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms|78|54|And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,                      To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
Psalms|78|55|He drove out the nations also before them,                      And allotted them for an inheritance by line,                      And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms|78|56|Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,                      And kept not his testimonies;
Psalms|78|57|But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:                      They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms|78|58|For they provoked him to anger with their high places,                      And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms|78|59|When God heard {this}, he was wroth,                      And greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms|78|60|So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,                      The tent which he placed among men;
Psalms|78|61|And delivered his strength into captivity,                      And his glory into the adversary’s hand.
Psalms|78|62|He gave his people over also unto the sword,                      And was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalms|78|63|Fire devoured their young men;                      And their virgins had no marriage-song.
Psalms|78|64|Their priests fell by the sword;                      And their widows made no lamentation.
Psalms|78|65|Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,                      Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psalms|78|66|And he smote his adversaries backward:                      He put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms|78|67|Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,                      And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
Psalms|78|68|But chose the tribe of Judah,                      The mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms|78|69|And he built his sanctuary like the heights,                      Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms|78|70|He chose David also his servant,                      And took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms|78|71|From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,                      To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms|78|72|So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,                      And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalms|79|1|O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance;                      Thy holy temple have they defiled;                      They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
Psalms|79|2|The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens,                      The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psalms|79|3|Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;                      And there was none to bury them.
Psalms|79|4|We are become a reproach to our neighbors,                      A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalms|79|5|How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever?                      Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms|79|6|Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not,                      And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
Psalms|79|7|For they have devoured Jacob,                      And laid waste his habitation.
Psalms|79|8|Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:                      Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us;                      For we are brought very low.
Psalms|79|9|Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name;                      And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake.
Psalms|79|10|Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God?                      Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed                      Be known among the nations in our sight.
Psalms|79|11|Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee:                      According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
Psalms|79|12|And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom                      Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalms|79|13|So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture                      Will give thee thanks for ever:                      We will show forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalms|80|1|Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,                      Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;                      Thou that sittest {above} the cherubim, shine forth.
Psalms|80|2|Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might,                      And come to save us.

Psalms|80|6|Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors;                      And our enemies laugh among themselves.
Psalms|80|7|Turn us again, O God of hosts;                      And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
Psalms|80|8|Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt:                      Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
Psalms|80|9|Thou preparedst {room} before it,                      And it took deep root, and filled the land.
Psalms|80|10|The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,                      And the boughs thereof were {like} cedars of God.
Psalms|80|11|It sent out its branches unto the sea,                      And its shoots unto the River.
Psalms|80|12|Why hast thou broken down its walls,                      So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
Psalms|80|13|The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,                      And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
Psalms|80|14|Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts:                      Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
Psalms|80|15|And the stock which thy right hand planted,                      And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms|80|16|It is burned with fire, it is cut down:                      They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psalms|80|17|Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,                      Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalms|80|18|So shall we not go back from thee:                      Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.

Psalms|81|11|But my people hearkened not to my voice;                      And Israel would none of me.
