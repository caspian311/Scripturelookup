Joel|2|27|And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.
Joel|2|28|And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
Joel|2|29|and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
Joel|2|30|And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
Joel|2|31|The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.
Joel|2|32|And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.
Joel|3|1|For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
Joel|3|2|I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,
Joel|3|3|and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
Joel|3|4|Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.
Joel|3|5|Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,
Joel|3|6|and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;
Joel|3|7|behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;
Joel|3|8|and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Joel|3|9|Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.
Joel|3|10|Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
Joel|3|11|Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.
Joel|3|12|Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
Joel|3|13|Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
Joel|3|14|Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.
Joel|3|15|The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|3|16|And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
Joel|3|17|So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
Joel|3|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
Joel|3|19|Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
Joel|3|20|But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
Joel|3|21|And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.
Job|1|1|There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.
Job|1|2|And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job|1|3|His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.
Job|1|4|And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
Job|1|5|And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
Job|1|6|Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.
Job|1|7|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|1|8|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.
Job|1|9|Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Job|1|10|Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
Job|1|11|But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|1|12|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
Job|1|13|And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
Job|1|14|that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;
Job|1|15|and the Sabeans fell {upon them}, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|16|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|17|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|18|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
Job|1|19|and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|20|Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;
Job|1|21|and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.
Job|1|22|In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
Job|2|1|Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
Job|2|2|And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|2|3|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
Job|2|4|And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
Job|2|5|But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|2|6|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.
Job|2|7|So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
Job|2|8|And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.
Job|2|9|Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.
Job|2|10|But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
Job|2|11|Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
Job|2|12|And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
Job|2|13|So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
Job|3|1|After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
Job|3|2|And Job answered and said:
Job|3|3|Let the day perish wherein I was born,                   And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.
Job|3|4|Let that day be darkness;                   Let not God from above seek for it,                   Neither let the light shine upon it.
Job|3|5|Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;                   Let a cloud dwell upon it;                   Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
Job|3|6|As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:                   Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;                   Let it not come into the number of the months.
Job|3|7|Lo, let that night be barren;                   Let no joyful voice come therein.
Job|3|8|Let them curse it that curse the day,                   Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
Job|3|9|Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:                   Let it look for light, but have none;                   Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
Job|3|10|Because it shut not up the doors of my {mother’s} womb,                   Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
Job|3|11|Why died I not from the womb?                   Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?
Job|3|12|Why did the knees receive me?                   Or why the breast, that I should suck?
Job|3|13|For now should I have lain down and been quiet;                   I should have slept; then had I been at rest,
Job|3|14|With kings and counsellors of the earth,                   Who built up waste places for themselves;
Job|3|15|Or with princes that had gold,                   Who filled their houses with silver:
Job|3|16|Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,                   As infants that never saw light.
Job|3|17|There the wicked cease from troubling;                   And there the weary are at rest.
Job|3|18|There the prisoners are at ease together;                   They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
Job|3|19|The small and the great are there:                   And the servant is free from his master.
Job|3|20|Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,                   And life unto the bitter in soul;
Job|3|21|Who long for death, but it cometh not,                   And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
Job|3|22|Who rejoice exceedingly,                   And are glad, when they can find the grave?
Job|3|23|{Why is light given} to a man whose way is hid,                   And whom God hath hedged in?
Job|3|24|For my sighing cometh before I eat,                   And my groanings are poured out like water.
Job|3|25|For the thing which I fear cometh upon me,                   And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.
Job|3|26|I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;                   But trouble cometh.
Job|4|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|4|2|If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?                   But who can withhold himself from speaking?
Job|4|3|Behold, thou hast instructed many,                   And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
Job|4|4|Thy words have upholden him that was falling,                   And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.
Job|4|5|But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;                   It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
Job|4|6|Is not thy fear {of God} thy confidence,                           {And} the integrity of thy ways thy hope?
Job|4|7|Remember, I pray thee, who {ever} perished, being innocent?                   Or where were the upright cut off?
Job|4|8|According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,                   And sow trouble, reap the same.
Job|4|9|By the breath of God they perish,                   And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.
Job|4|10|The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,                   And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
Job|4|11|The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,                   And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
Job|4|12|Now a thing was secretly brought to me,                   And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
