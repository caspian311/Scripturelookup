Genesis|32|15|thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
Genesis|32|16|And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Genesis|32|17|And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
Genesis|32|18|then thou shalt say {They are} thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
Genesis|32|19|And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
Genesis|32|20|and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
Genesis|32|21|So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
Genesis|32|22|And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
Genesis|32|23|And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
Genesis|32|24|And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis|32|25|And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
Genesis|32|26|And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Genesis|32|27|And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
Genesis|32|28|And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
Genesis|32|29|And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
Genesis|32|30|And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, {said he}, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
Genesis|32|31|And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
Genesis|32|32|Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
Genesis|33|1|And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
Genesis|33|2|And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
Genesis|33|3|And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis|33|4|And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
Genesis|33|5|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
Genesis|33|6|Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|7|And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|8|And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|9|And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
Genesis|33|10|And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Genesis|33|11|Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
Genesis|33|12|And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
Genesis|33|13|And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis|33|14|Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
Genesis|33|15|And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|16|So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Genesis|33|17|And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Genesis|33|18|And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
Genesis|33|19|And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
Genesis|33|20|And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
Genesis|34|1|And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Genesis|34|2|And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
Genesis|34|3|And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
Genesis|34|4|And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|5|Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis|34|6|And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Genesis|34|7|And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
Genesis|34|8|And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.
Genesis|34|9|And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
Genesis|34|10|And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
Genesis|34|11|And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Genesis|34|12|Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|13|And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
Genesis|34|14|and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.
Genesis|34|15|Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
Genesis|34|16|then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
Genesis|34|17|But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
Genesis|34|18|And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
Genesis|34|19|And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
Genesis|34|20|And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
Genesis|34|21|These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis|34|22|Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Genesis|34|23|Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
Genesis|34|24|And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis|34|25|And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
Genesis|34|26|And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.
Genesis|34|27|The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis|34|28|They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
Genesis|34|29|and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
Genesis|34|30|And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
Genesis|34|31|And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
Genesis|35|1|And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Genesis|35|2|Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
Genesis|35|3|and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
Genesis|35|4|And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Genesis|35|5|And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
Genesis|35|6|So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
Genesis|35|7|And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Genesis|35|8|And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
Genesis|35|9|And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis|35|10|And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
Genesis|35|11|And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Genesis|35|12|and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
Genesis|35|13|And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
Genesis|35|14|And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
Genesis|35|15|And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
Genesis|35|16|And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
Genesis|35|17|And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
Genesis|35|18|And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
Genesis|35|19|And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis|35|20|And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
Genesis|35|21|And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis|35|22|And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard of it.      Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Genesis|35|23|The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
Genesis|35|24|the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis|35|25|and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
Genesis|35|26|and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis|35|27|And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
Genesis|35|28|And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
Genesis|35|29|And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
Genesis|36|1|Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
Genesis|36|2|Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
