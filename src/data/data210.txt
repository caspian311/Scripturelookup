Exodus|5|5|And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
Exodus|5|6|And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
Exodus|5|7|Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus|5|8|And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Exodus|5|9|Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.
Exodus|5|10|And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
Exodus|5|11|Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.
Exodus|5|12|So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus|5|13|And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, {your} daily tasks, as when there was straw.
Exodus|5|14|And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?
Exodus|5|15|Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
Exodus|5|16|There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.
Exodus|5|17|But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
Exodus|5|18|Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
Exodus|5|19|And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, {your} daily tasks.
Exodus|5|20|And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
Exodus|5|21|and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
Exodus|5|22|And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
Exodus|5|23|For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
Exodus|6|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
Exodus|6|2|And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:
Exodus|6|3|and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.
Exodus|6|4|And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
Exodus|6|5|And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
Exodus|6|6|Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
Exodus|6|7|and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exodus|6|8|And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.
Exodus|6|9|And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
Exodus|6|10|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|6|11|Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
