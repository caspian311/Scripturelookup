1 Chronicles|10|13|So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire {thereby},

1 Chronicles|11|19|and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with {the jeopardy of} their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles|11|20|And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.
1 Chronicles|11|21|Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the {first} three.
1 Chronicles|11|22|Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two {sons of} Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
1 Chronicles|11|23|And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
1 Chronicles|11|24|These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles|11|25|Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three: and David set him over his guard.
1 Chronicles|11|26|Also the mighty men of the armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,
