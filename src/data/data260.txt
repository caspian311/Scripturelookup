Leviticus|15|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|15|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
Leviticus|15|3|And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.
Leviticus|15|4|Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|5|And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|6|And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|7|And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|8|And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|9|And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|10|And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|11|And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|12|And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
Leviticus|15|13|And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|14|And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:
Leviticus|15|15|and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue.
Leviticus|15|16|And if any manâ€™s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|17|And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|18|The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|19|And if a woman have an issue, {and} her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|20|And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|21|And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|22|And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|23|And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|24|And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|25|And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.
Leviticus|15|26|Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.
Leviticus|15|27|And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|28|But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|29|And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|15|30|And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness.
Leviticus|15|31|Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.
Leviticus|15|32|This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;
Leviticus|15|33|and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
Leviticus|16|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;
Leviticus|16|2|and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
Leviticus|16|3|Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|16|4|He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
Leviticus|16|5|And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|16|6|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
Leviticus|16|7|And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|16|8|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.
Leviticus|16|9|And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|16|10|But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.
Leviticus|16|11|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:
Leviticus|16|12|and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:
Leviticus|16|13|and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
Leviticus|16|14|and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus|16|15|Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
Leviticus|16|16|and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
Leviticus|16|17|And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
Leviticus|16|18|And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
Leviticus|16|19|And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
Leviticus|16|20|And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:
Leviticus|16|21|and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:
Leviticus|16|22|and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus|16|23|And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
Leviticus|16|24|and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus|16|25|And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
Leviticus|16|26|And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus|16|27|And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
Leviticus|16|28|And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus|16|29|And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:
Leviticus|16|30|for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.
Leviticus|16|31|It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.
Leviticus|16|32|And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his fatherâ€™s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:
Leviticus|16|33|and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus|16|34|And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|17|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|17|2|Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,
Leviticus|17|3|What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,
Leviticus|17|4|and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
Leviticus|17|5|To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|6|And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|7|And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.
Leviticus|17|8|And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
Leviticus|17|9|and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|17|10|And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus|17|11|For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.
Leviticus|17|12|Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
Leviticus|17|13|And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
Leviticus|17|14|For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is {all one} with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
Leviticus|17|15|And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
Leviticus|17|16|But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|18|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|18|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|3|After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
Leviticus|18|4|Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|5|Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|6|None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover {their} nakedness: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|7|The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|8|The nakedness of thy fatherâ€™s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy fatherâ€™s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|9|The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
Leviticus|18|10|The nakedness of thy sonâ€™s daughter, or of thy daughterâ€™s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.
Leviticus|18|11|The nakedness of thy fatherâ€™s wifeâ€™s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|12|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fatherâ€™s sister: she is thy fatherâ€™s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|13|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy motherâ€™s sister: for she is thy motherâ€™s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|14|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fatherâ€™s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
Leviticus|18|15|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy sonâ€™s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|16|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brotherâ€™s wife: it is thy brotherâ€™s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|17|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her sonâ€™s daughter, or her daughterâ€™s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
