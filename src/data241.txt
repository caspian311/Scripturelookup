Micah|4|11|And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see {our desire} upon Zion.
Micah|4|12|But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.
Micah|4|13|Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
Micah|5|1|Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
Micah|5|2|But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
Micah|5|3|Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
Micah|5|4|And he shall stand, and shall feed {his flock} in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
Micah|5|5|And this {man} shall be {our} peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
Micah|5|6|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.
Micah|5|7|And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
Micah|5|8|And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
Micah|5|9|Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.
Micah|5|10|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots:
Micah|5|11|and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.
Micah|5|12|And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no {more} soothsayers:
Micah|5|13|and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands;
Micah|5|14|and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.
Micah|5|15|And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.
Micah|6|1|Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
Micah|6|2|Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
Micah|6|3|O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
Micah|6|4|For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
Micah|6|5|O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; {remember} from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.
Micah|6|6|Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?
Micah|6|7|will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, {or} with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah|6|8|He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?
Micah|6|9|The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and {the man of} wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
Micah|6|10|Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?
Micah|6|11|Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?
Micah|6|12|For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Micah|6|13|Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.
Micah|6|14|Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.
Micah|6|15|Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.
Micah|6|16|For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
Micah|7|1|Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.
Micah|7|2|The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
Micah|7|3|Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge {is ready} for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.
Micah|7|4|The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is {worse} than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.
Micah|7|5|Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
Micah|7|6|For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
Micah|7|7|But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
Micah|7|8|Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.
Micah|7|9|I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, {and} I shall behold his righteousness.
Micah|7|10|Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see {my desire} upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
Micah|7|11|A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.
Micah|7|12|In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and {from} mountain to mountain.
Micah|7|13|Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
Micah|7|14|Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
Micah|7|15|As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.
Micah|7|16|The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
Micah|7|17|They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.
Micah|7|18|Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.
Micah|7|19|He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah|7|20|Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, {and} the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
Joel|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Joel|1|2|Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
Joel|1|3|Tell ye your children of it, and {let} your children {tell} their children, and their children another generation.
Joel|1|4|That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
Joel|1|5|Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
Joel|1|6|For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
Joel|1|7|He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
Joel|1|8|Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
Joel|1|9|The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn.
Joel|1|10|The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
Joel|1|11|Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.
Joel|1|12|The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.
Joel|1|13|Gird yourselves {with sackcloth}, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.
Joel|1|14|Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men {and} all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.
Joel|1|15|Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
Joel|1|16|Is not the food cut off before our eyes, {yea}, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
Joel|1|17|The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.
Joel|1|18|How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
Joel|1|19|O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
Joel|1|20|Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
Joel|2|1|Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;
Joel|2|2|a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.
Joel|2|3|A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.
Joel|2|4|The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.
Joel|2|5|Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
Joel|2|6|At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.
Joel|2|7|They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.
Joel|2|8|Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off {their course}.
Joel|2|9|They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.
Joel|2|10|The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|2|11|And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
Joel|2|12|Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
Joel|2|13|and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
Joel|2|14|Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?
Joel|2|15|Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;
Joel|2|16|gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
Joel|2|17|Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
Joel|2|18|Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
Joel|2|19|And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;
Joel|2|20|but I will remove far off from you the northern {army}, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.
Joel|2|21|Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.
Joel|2|22|Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
Joel|2|23|Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first {month}.
Joel|2|24|And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
Joel|2|25|And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
Joel|2|26|And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.
