2 Kings|23|31|Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|23|32|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings|23|33|And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
2 Kings|23|34|And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.
2 Kings|23|35|And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-necoh.
2 Kings|23|36|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2 Kings|23|37|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings|24|1|In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
2 Kings|24|2|And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets.
2 Kings|24|3|Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,
2 Kings|24|4|and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon.
2 Kings|24|5|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|24|6|So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|24|7|And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land; for the king of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
2 Kings|24|8|Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|24|9|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father had done.
2 Kings|24|10|At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
2 Kings|24|11|And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;
2 Kings|24|12|and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
2 Kings|24|13|And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.
2 Kings|24|14|And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
2 Kings|24|15|And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|16|And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|17|And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, {Jehoiachin’s} father’s brother, king is his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings|24|18|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|24|19|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings|24|20|For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings|25|1|And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
2 Kings|25|2|So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings|25|3|On the ninth day of the {fourth} month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
2 Kings|25|4|Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war {fled} by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and {the king} went by the way of the Arabah.
2 Kings|25|5|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings|25|6|Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
2 Kings|25|7|And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2 Kings|25|8|Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.
2 Kings|25|9|And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.
2 Kings|25|10|And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were {with} the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
2 Kings|25|11|And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
2 Kings|25|12|But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
2 Kings|25|13|And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
2 Kings|25|14|And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
2 Kings|25|15|And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
2 Kings|25|16|The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
2 Kings|25|17|The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with network.
2 Kings|25|18|And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:
2 Kings|25|19|and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.
2 Kings|25|20|And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
2 Kings|25|21|And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
2 Kings|25|22|And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
2 Kings|25|23|Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
2 Kings|25|24|And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
2 Kings|25|25|But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
2 Kings|25|26|And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
2 Kings|25|27|And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
2 Kings|25|28|and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
2 Kings|25|29|and changed his prison garments. And {Jehoiachin} did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:
2 Kings|25|30|and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.

Genesis|1|16|And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: {he made} the stars also.

Genesis|1|29|And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:
Genesis|1|30|and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, {I have given} every green herb for food: and it was so.

Genesis|2|5|And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;
Genesis|2|6|but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis|2|7|And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

Genesis|2|9|And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis|2|10|And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
Genesis|2|11|The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
Genesis|2|12|and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
