Hebrews|8|13|In that he saith, A new {covenant} he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.
Hebrews|9|1|Now even a first {covenant} had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, {a sanctuary} of this world.
Hebrews|9|2|For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein {were} the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.
Hebrews|9|3|And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;
Hebrews|9|4|having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein {was} a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews|9|5|and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.
Hebrews|9|6|Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;
Hebrews|9|7|but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:
Hebrews|9|8|the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;
Hebrews|9|9|which {is} a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,
Hebrews|9|10|{being} only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
Hebrews|9|11|But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
Hebrews|9|12|nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.
Hebrews|9|13|For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:
Hebrews|9|14|how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews|9|15|And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews|9|16|For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.
Hebrews|9|17|For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.
Hebrews|9|18|Wherefore even the first {covenant} hath not been dedicated without blood.
Hebrews|9|19|For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews|9|20|saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.
Hebrews|9|21|Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.
Hebrews|9|22|And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
Hebrews|9|23|It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews|9|24|For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:
Hebrews|9|25|nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;
Hebrews|9|26|else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews|9|27|And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this {cometh} judgment;
Hebrews|9|28|so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.
Hebrews|10|1|For the law having a shadow of the good {things} to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.
Hebrews|10|2|Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.
Hebrews|10|3|But in those {sacrifices} there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
Hebrews|10|4|For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
Hebrews|10|5|Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith,             Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not,                   But a body didst thou prepare for me;
Hebrews|10|6|In whole burnt offerings and {sacrifices} for sin thou hadst no pleasure:
Hebrews|10|7|Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me)                   To do thy will, O God.
Hebrews|10|8|Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and {sacrifices} for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),
Hebrews|10|9|then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
Hebrews|10|10|By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews|10|11|And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:
Hebrews|10|12|but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
Hebrews|10|13|henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.
Hebrews|10|14|For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews|10|15|And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,
Hebrews|10|16|This is the covenant that I will make with them                   After those days, saith the Lord:                   I will put my laws on their heart,                   And upon their mind also will I write them;                   {then saith he,}
Hebrews|10|17|And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews|10|18|Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
Hebrews|10|19|Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews|10|20|by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
Hebrews|10|21|and {having} a great priest over the house of God;
Hebrews|10|22|let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,
Hebrews|10|23|let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:
Hebrews|10|24|and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;
Hebrews|10|25|not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting {one another}; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.
Hebrews|10|26|For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews|10|27|but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.
Hebrews|10|28|A man that hath set at nought Moses law dieth without compassion on {the word of} two or three witnesses:
Hebrews|10|29|of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews|10|30|For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
Hebrews|10|31|It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews|10|32|But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews|10|33|partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.
Hebrews|10|34|For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
Hebrews|10|35|Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.
Hebrews|10|36|For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.
Hebrews|10|37|For yet a very little while,                   He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.
Hebrews|10|38|But my righteous one shall live by faith:                   And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.
Hebrews|10|39|But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.
Hebrews|11|1|Now faith is assurance of {things} hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.
Hebrews|11|2|For therein the elders had witness borne to them.
Hebrews|11|3|By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.
Hebrews|11|4|By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.
Hebrews|11|5|By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:
Hebrews|11|6|And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing {unto him}; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and {that} he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.
Hebrews|11|7|By faith Noah, being warned {of God} concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
Hebrews|11|8|By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
Hebrews|11|9|By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a {land} not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
Hebrews|11|10|for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
Hebrews|11|11|By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:
Hebrews|11|12|wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, {so many} as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.
Hebrews|11|13|These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
Hebrews|11|14|For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.
Hebrews|11|15|And if indeed they had been mindful of that {country} from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
Hebrews|11|16|But now they desire a better {country}, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
Hebrews|11|17|By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten {son};
Hebrews|11|18|even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews|11|19|accounting that God {is} able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.
Hebrews|11|20|By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
Hebrews|11|21|By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, {leaning} upon the top of his staff.
Hebrews|11|22|By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
Hebrews|11|23|By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the kingâ€™s commandment.
Hebrews|11|24|By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter;
Hebrews|11|25|choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
Hebrews|11|26|accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.
Hebrews|11|27|By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
Hebrews|11|28|By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
Hebrews|11|29|By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.
Hebrews|11|30|By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.
Hebrews|11|31|By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
Hebrews|11|32|And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:
