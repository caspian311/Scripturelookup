Deuteronomy|13|7|of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
Deuteronomy|13|8|thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
Deuteronomy|13|9|but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
Deuteronomy|13|10|And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|13|11|And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|13|12|If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,
Deuteronomy|13|13|Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
Deuteronomy|13|14|then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,
Deuteronomy|13|15|thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

Deuteronomy|13|17|And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

Deuteronomy|14|6|And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof cloven in two, {and} cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Deuteronomy|14|7|Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you.
Deuteronomy|14|8|And the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch.
Deuteronomy|14|9|These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat;
Deuteronomy|14|10|and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you.

Deuteronomy|14|14|and every raven after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|15|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|16|the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
Deuteronomy|14|17|and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
Deuteronomy|14|18|and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Deuteronomy|14|19|And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy|14|20|Of all clean birds ye may eat.
Deuteronomy|14|21|Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou mayest give it unto the sojourner that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner: for thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.

Deuteronomy|14|24|And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee;
Deuteronomy|14|25|then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose:
Deuteronomy|14|26|and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household.

Deuteronomy|14|28|At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
Deuteronomy|14|29|and the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.
Deuteronomy|15|1|At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
Deuteronomy|15|2|And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah’s release hath been proclaimed.
Deuteronomy|15|3|Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.
Deuteronomy|15|4|Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;)
Deuteronomy|15|5|if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.

Deuteronomy|15|9|Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
Deuteronomy|15|10|Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|15|11|For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.

Deuteronomy|15|13|And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:
