Deuteronomy|9|22|And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.
Deuteronomy|9|23|And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
Deuteronomy|9|24|Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy|9|25|So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|26|And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy|9|27|Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,
Deuteronomy|9|28|lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Deuteronomy|9|29|Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.
Deuteronomy|10|1|At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy|10|2|And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
Deuteronomy|10|3|So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
Deuteronomy|10|4|And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy|10|5|And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me.
Deuteronomy|10|6|(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priestâ€™s office in his stead.
Deuteronomy|10|7|From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
Deuteronomy|10|8|At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
Deuteronomy|10|9|Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)
Deuteronomy|10|10|And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.
Deuteronomy|10|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
Deuteronomy|10|12|And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
Deuteronomy|10|13|to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
Deuteronomy|10|14|Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
Deuteronomy|10|15|Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|10|16|Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
Deuteronomy|10|17|For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
Deuteronomy|10|18|He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.
Deuteronomy|10|19|Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|10|20|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
Deuteronomy|10|21|He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy|10|22|Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy|11|1|Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.
Deuteronomy|11|2|And know ye this day: for {I speak} not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,
Deuteronomy|11|3|and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy|11|4|and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;
Deuteronomy|11|5|and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;
Deuteronomy|11|6|and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
Deuteronomy|11|7|but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.
Deuteronomy|11|8|Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|11|9|and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|11|10|For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;
Deuteronomy|11|11|but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, {and} drinketh water of the rain of heaven,
Deuteronomy|11|12|a land which Jehovah thy God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
Deuteronomy|11|13|And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy|11|14|that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil.
Deuteronomy|11|15|And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.
Deuteronomy|11|16|Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
Deuteronomy|11|17|and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you.
Deuteronomy|11|18|Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
Deuteronomy|11|19|And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|11|20|And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;
Deuteronomy|11|21|that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
Deuteronomy|11|22|For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
Deuteronomy|11|23|then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
Deuteronomy|11|24|Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.
Deuteronomy|11|25|There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.
Deuteronomy|11|26|Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
Deuteronomy|11|27|the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;
Deuteronomy|11|28|and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
Deuteronomy|11|29|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy|11|30|Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
Deuteronomy|11|31|For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
Deuteronomy|11|32|And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
Deuteronomy|12|1|These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
Deuteronomy|12|2|Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
Deuteronomy|12|3|and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy|12|4|Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|12|5|But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;
Deuteronomy|12|6|and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:
Deuteronomy|12|7|and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.
Deuteronomy|12|8|Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;
Deuteronomy|12|9|for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy|12|10|But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
Deuteronomy|12|11|then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|12|And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy|12|13|Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;
Deuteronomy|12|14|but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
Deuteronomy|12|15|Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
Deuteronomy|12|16|Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|17|Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;
Deuteronomy|12|18|but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|12|19|Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land.
Deuteronomy|12|20|When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|21|If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|22|Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.
Deuteronomy|12|23|Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|24|Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|25|Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|26|Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose:
Deuteronomy|12|27|and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|28|Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|12|29|When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;
Deuteronomy|12|30|take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
Deuteronomy|12|31|Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy|12|32|What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
Deuteronomy|13|1|If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,
Deuteronomy|13|2|and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
Deuteronomy|13|3|thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy|13|4|Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
Deuteronomy|13|5|And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which Jehovah thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|13|6|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
