Psalms|78|40|How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,                      And grieve him in the desert!
Psalms|78|41|And they turned again and tempted God,                      And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms|78|42|They remember not his hand,                      Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
Psalms|78|43|How he set his signs in Egypt,                      And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
Psalms|78|44|And turned their rivers into blood,                      And their streams, so that they could not drink.
Psalms|78|45|He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;                      And frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms|78|46|He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,                      And their labor unto the locust.
Psalms|78|47|He destroyed their vines with hail,                      And their sycomore-trees with frost.
Psalms|78|48|He gave over their cattle also to the hail,                      And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms|78|49|He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,                      Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,                      A band of angels of evil.
Psalms|78|50|He made a path for his anger;                      He spared not their soul from death,                      But gave their life over to the pestilence,
Psalms|78|51|And smote all the first-born in Egypt,                      The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms|78|52|But he led forth his own people like sheep,                      And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms|78|53|And he led them safely, so that they feared not;                      But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms|78|54|And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,                      To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
Psalms|78|55|He drove out the nations also before them,                      And allotted them for an inheritance by line,                      And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms|78|56|Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,                      And kept not his testimonies;
Psalms|78|57|But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:                      They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms|78|58|For they provoked him to anger with their high places,                      And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms|78|59|When God heard {this}, he was wroth,                      And greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms|78|60|So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,                      The tent which he placed among men;
Psalms|78|61|And delivered his strength into captivity,                      And his glory into the adversary’s hand.
Psalms|78|62|He gave his people over also unto the sword,                      And was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalms|78|63|Fire devoured their young men;                      And their virgins had no marriage-song.
Psalms|78|64|Their priests fell by the sword;                      And their widows made no lamentation.

Psalms|78|66|And he smote his adversaries backward:                      He put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalms|78|67|Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph,                      And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
Psalms|78|68|But chose the tribe of Judah,                      The mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms|78|69|And he built his sanctuary like the heights,                      Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms|78|70|He chose David also his servant,                      And took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms|78|71|From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,                      To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms|78|72|So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,                      And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalms|79|1|O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance;                      Thy holy temple have they defiled;                      They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

Psalms|79|5|How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever?                      Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms|79|6|Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not,                      And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
Psalms|79|7|For they have devoured Jacob,                      And laid waste his habitation.
Psalms|79|8|Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:                      Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us;                      For we are brought very low.
Psalms|79|9|Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name;                      And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake.

Psalms|79|11|Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee:                      According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
Psalms|79|12|And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom                      Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalms|79|13|So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture                      Will give thee thanks for ever:                      We will show forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalms|80|1|Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,                      Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;                      Thou that sittest {above} the cherubim, shine forth.

Psalms|106|13|They soon forgat his works;                      They waited not for his counsel,
Psalms|106|14|But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,                      And tempted God in the desert.
Psalms|106|15|And he gave them their request,                      But sent leanness into their soul.

Psalms|106|24|Yea, they despised the pleasant land,                      They believed not his word,
Psalms|106|25|But murmured in their tents,                      And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
Psalms|106|26|Therefore he sware unto them,                      That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
Psalms|106|27|And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,                      And scatter them in the lands.
Psalms|106|28|They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor,                      And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psalms|106|29|Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings;                      And the plague brake in upon them.

Psalms|106|31|And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness,                      Unto all generations for evermore.
Psalms|106|32|They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,                      So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
Psalms|106|33|Because they were rebellious against his spirit,                      And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psalms|106|34|They did not destroy the peoples,                      As Jehovah commanded them,
Psalms|106|35|But mingled themselves with the nations,                      And learned their works,
Psalms|106|36|And served their idols,                      Which became a snare unto them.
Psalms|106|37|Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
Psalms|106|38|And shed innocent blood,                      Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,                      Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan;                      And the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms|106|39|Thus were they defiled with their works,                      And played the harlot in their doings.
Psalms|106|40|Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people,                      And he abhorred his inheritance.
Psalms|106|41|And he gave them into the hand of the nations;                      And they that hated them ruled over them.
Psalms|106|42|Their enemies also oppressed them,                      And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psalms|106|43|Many times did he deliver them;                      But they were rebellious in their counsel,                      And were brought low in their iniquity.
Psalms|106|44|Nevertheless he regarded their distress,                      When he heard their cry:
Psalms|106|45|And he remembered for them his covenant,                      And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
Psalms|106|46|He made them also to be pitied                      Of all those that carried them captive.
Psalms|106|47|Save us, O Jehovah our God,                      And gather us from among the nations,                      To give thanks unto thy holy name,                      And to triumph in thy praise.
Psalms|106|48|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel,                      From everlasting even to everlasting.                      And let all the people say, Amen.                      Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms|107|1|O give thanks unto Jehovah;                      For he is good;                      For his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever.
Psalms|107|2|Let the redeemed of Jehovah say {so},                      Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
Psalms|107|3|And gathered out of the lands,                      From the east and from the west,                      From the north and from the south.

Psalms|107|10|Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,                      Being bound in affliction and iron,
Psalms|107|11|Because they rebelled against the words of God,                      And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
Psalms|107|12|Therefore he brought down their heart with labor;                      They fell down, and there was none to help.
Psalms|107|13|Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble,                      And he saved them out of their distresses.

Psalms|107|28|Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble,                      And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psalms|107|29|He maketh the storm a calm,                      So that the waves thereof are still.

Titus|1|1|Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
Titus|1|2|in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
Titus|1|3|but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus|1|4|to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
Titus|1|5|For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
Titus|1|6|if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus|1|7|For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
Titus|1|8|but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
Titus|1|9|holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
Titus|1|10|For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
Titus|1|11|whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
Titus|1|12|One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
Titus|1|13|This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus|1|14|not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus|1|15|To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus|1|16|They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
Titus|2|1|But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
Titus|2|2|that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
Titus|2|3|that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
Titus|2|4|that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus|2|5|{to be} sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
Titus|2|6|the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
Titus|2|7|in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine {showing} uncorruptness, gravity,
Titus|2|8|sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
Titus|2|9|{Exhort} servants to be in subjection to their own masters, {and} to be well-pleasing {to them} in all things; not gainsaying;
Titus|2|10|not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus|2|11|For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus|2|12|instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
Titus|2|13|looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus|2|14|who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
Titus|2|15|These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
Titus|3|1|Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
Titus|3|2|to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
Titus|3|3|For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus|3|4|But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
Titus|3|5|not by works {done} in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus|3|6|which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus|3|7|that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus|3|8|Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
Titus|3|9|but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus|3|10|A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
Titus|3|11|knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
Titus|3|12|When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
Titus|3|13|Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus|3|14|And let our {people} also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus|3|15|All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
Habakkuk|1|1|The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk|1|2|O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.
Habakkuk|1|3|Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.
Habakkuk|1|4|Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.
Habakkuk|1|5|Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.
Habakkuk|1|6|For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
Habakkuk|1|7|They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk|1|8|Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.
Habakkuk|1|9|They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.
Habakkuk|1|10|Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.
Habakkuk|1|11|Then shall he sweep by {as} a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, {even} he whose might is his god.
Habakkuk|1|12|Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.
Habakkuk|1|13|Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;
Habakkuk|1|14|and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
Habakkuk|1|15|He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.
Habakkuk|1|16|Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.
Habakkuk|1|17|Shall he therefore empty his net, and spare not to slay the nations continually?
Habakkuk|2|1|I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.
Habakkuk|2|2|And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.
Habakkuk|2|3|For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.
Habakkuk|2|4|Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.
Habakkuk|2|5|Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.
Habakkuk|2|6|Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!
Habakkuk|2|7|Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?
Habakkuk|2|8|Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|9|Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
Habakkuk|2|10|Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.
Habakkuk|2|11|For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
Habakkuk|2|12|Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!
Habakkuk|2|13|Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
Habakkuk|2|14|For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk|2|15|Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, {to thee} that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
Habakkuk|2|16|Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.
Habakkuk|2|17|For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|18|What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
Habakkuk|2|19|Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.
Habakkuk|2|20|But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
Habakkuk|3|1|A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.
Habakkuk|3|2|O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid:                   O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years;                   In the midst of the years make it known;                   In wrath remember mercy.
Habakkuk|3|3|God came from Teman,                   And the Holy One from mount Paran.            Selah.             His glory covered the heavens,                   And the earth was full of his praise.
Habakkuk|3|4|And {his} brightness was as the light;                   He had rays {coming forth} from his hand;                   And there was the hiding of his power.
Habakkuk|3|5|Before him went the pestilence,                   And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
Habakkuk|3|6|He stood, and measured the earth;                   He beheld, and drove asunder the nations;                   And the eternal mountains were scattered;                   The everlasting hills did bow;                   His goings were {as} of old.
Habakkuk|3|7|I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;                   The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
Habakkuk|3|8|Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers?                   Was thine anger against the rivers,                   Or thy wrath against the sea,                   That thou didst ride upon thy horses,                   Upon thy chariots of salvation?
Habakkuk|3|9|Thy bow was made quite bare;                   The oaths to the tribes were a {sure} word.            Selah.             Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
Habakkuk|3|10|The mountains saw thee, and were afraid;                   The tempest of waters passed by;                   The deep uttered its voice,                   And lifted up its hands on high.
Habakkuk|3|11|The sun and moon stood still in their habitation,                   At the light of thine arrows as they went,                   At the shining of thy glittering spear.
Habakkuk|3|12|Thou didst march though the land in indignation;                   Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.
Habakkuk|3|13|Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,                   For the salvation of thine anointed;                   Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man,                   Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.            Selah.
Habakkuk|3|14|Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors:                   They came as a whirlwind to scatter me;                   Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
Habakkuk|3|15|Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses,                   The heap of mighty waters.
Habakkuk|3|16|I heard, and my body trembled,                   My lips quivered at the voice;                   Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place;                   Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,                   For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.
Habakkuk|3|17|For though the fig-tree shall not flourish,                   Neither shall fruit be in the vines;                   The labor of the olive shall fail,                   And the fields shall yield no food;                   The flock shall be cut off from the fold,                   And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
Habakkuk|3|18|Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah,                   I will joy in the God of my salvation.
Habakkuk|3|19|Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength;                   And he maketh my feet like hinds’ {feet},                   And will make me to walk upon my high places.
Jonah|1|1|Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
Jonah|1|2|Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
Jonah|1|3|But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.
Jonah|1|4|But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
Jonah|1|5|Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
Jonah|1|6|So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
Jonah|1|7|And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
Jonah|1|8|Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
Jonah|1|9|And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.
Jonah|1|10|Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
Jonah|1|11|Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
Jonah|1|12|And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
Jonah|1|13|Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
Jonah|1|14|Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.
Jonah|1|15|So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
Jonah|1|16|Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.
Jonah|1|17|And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Jonah|2|1|Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish’s belly.
Jonah|2|2|And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, {And} thou heardest my voice.
Jonah|2|3|For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
Jonah|2|4|And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|5|The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.
Jonah|2|6|I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars {closed} upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
Jonah|2|7|When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|8|They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.
Jonah|2|9|But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.
Jonah|2|10|And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
Jonah|3|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah|3|2|Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
Jonah|3|3|So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.
Jonah|3|4|And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
Jonah|3|5|And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
Jonah|3|6|And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
Jonah|3|7|And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;
Jonah|3|8|but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
Jonah|3|9|Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
Jonah|3|10|And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.
Jonah|4|1|But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
Jonah|4|2|And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
Jonah|4|3|Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|4|And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?
Jonah|4|5|Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
Jonah|4|6|And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.
Jonah|4|7|But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
Jonah|4|8|And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|9|And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
Jonah|4|10|And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:
Jonah|4|11|and should not I have regard for Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
1 Samuel|1|1|Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
1 Samuel|1|2|and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1 Samuel|1|3|And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.
1 Samuel|1|4|And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
1 Samuel|1|5|but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|6|And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|7|And {as} he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1 Samuel|1|8|And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1 Samuel|1|9|So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|10|And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.
1 Samuel|1|11|And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
1 Samuel|1|12|And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
1 Samuel|1|13|Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1 Samuel|1|14|And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
1 Samuel|1|15|And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|16|Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.
1 Samuel|1|17|Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1 Samuel|1|18|And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat; and her countenance was no more {sad}.
1 Samuel|1|19|And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
1 Samuel|1|20|And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, {saying}, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|21|And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1 Samuel|1|22|But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, {I will not go up} until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
1 Samuel|1|23|And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
1 Samuel|1|24|And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1 Samuel|1|25|And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel|1|26|And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|27|For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
1 Samuel|1|28|therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.
1 Samuel|2|1|And Hannah prayed, and said:             My heart exulteth in Jehovah;                   My horn is exalted in Jehovah;                   My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies;                   Because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1 Samuel|2|2|There is none holy as Jehovah;                   For there is none besides thee,                   Neither is there any rock like our God.
1 Samuel|2|3|Talk no more so exceeding proudly;                   Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth;                   For Jehovah is a God of knowledge,                   And by him actions are weighed.
1 Samuel|2|4|The bows of the mighty men are broken;                   And they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1 Samuel|2|5|They that were full have hired out themselves for bread;                   And they that were hungry have ceased {to hunger}:                   Yea, the barren hath borne seven;                   And she that hath many children languisheth.
1 Samuel|2|6|Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive:                   He bringeth down to Sheol, and bringeth up.
1 Samuel|2|7|Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich:                   He bringeth low, he also lifteth up.
1 Samuel|2|8|He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,                   He lifteth up the needy from the dunghill,                   To make them sit with princes,                   And inherit the throne of glory:                   For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s,                   And he hath set the world upon them.
1 Samuel|2|9|He will keep the feet of his holy ones;                   But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;                   For by strength shall no man prevail.
1 Samuel|2|10|They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces;                   Against them will he thunder in heaven:                   Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth;                   And he will give strength unto his king,                   And exalt the horn of his anointed.
1 Samuel|2|11|And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto Jehovah before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel|2|12|Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|13|And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
1 Samuel|2|14|and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
1 Samuel|2|15|Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
1 Samuel|2|16|And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
1 Samuel|2|17|And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|18|But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
1 Samuel|2|19|Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel|2|20|And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.
1 Samuel|2|21|And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before Jehovah.
1 Samuel|2|22|Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
1 Samuel|2|23|And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
1 Samuel|2|24|Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.
1 Samuel|2|25|If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.
1 Samuel|2|26|And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Jehovah, and also with men.
1 Samuel|2|27|And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt {in bondage} to Pharaoh’s house?
1 Samuel|2|28|and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
1 Samuel|2|29|Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in {my} habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1 Samuel|2|30|Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
1 Samuel|2|31|Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
1 Samuel|2|32|And thou shalt behold the affliction of {my} habitation, in all the wealth which {God} shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
1 Samuel|2|33|And the man of thine, {whom} I shall not cut off from mine altar, {shall be} to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
1 Samuel|2|34|And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
1 Samuel|2|35|And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
1 Samuel|2|36|And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
1 Samuel|3|1|And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
1 Samuel|3|2|And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),
1 Samuel|3|3|and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep}, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
1 Samuel|3|4|that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|5|And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1 Samuel|3|6|And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
1 Samuel|3|7|Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.
1 Samuel|3|8|And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.
1 Samuel|3|9|Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
1 Samuel|3|10|And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
1 Samuel|3|11|And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
1 Samuel|3|12|In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.
1 Samuel|3|13|For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
1 Samuel|3|14|And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
1 Samuel|3|15|And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
1 Samuel|3|16|Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|17|And he said, What is the thing that {Jehovah} hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.
1 Samuel|3|18|And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what seemeth him good.
1 Samuel|3|19|And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
1 Samuel|3|20|And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|3|21|And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|4|1|And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.      Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
1 Samuel|4|2|And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1 Samuel|4|3|And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
1 Samuel|4|4|So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts, who sitteth {above} the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Samuel|4|5|And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
1 Samuel|4|6|And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.
1 Samuel|4|7|And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
1 Samuel|4|8|Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel|4|9|Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1 Samuel|4|10|And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
1 Samuel|4|11|And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1 Samuel|4|12|And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
1 Samuel|4|13|And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
1 Samuel|4|14|And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.
1 Samuel|4|15|Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
1 Samuel|4|16|And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?
1 Samuel|4|17|And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
1 Samuel|4|18|And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that {Eli} fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1 Samuel|4|19|And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.
1 Samuel|4|20|And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
1 Samuel|4|21|And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
1 Samuel|4|22|And she said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.
1 Samuel|5|1|Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
1 Samuel|5|2|And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
1 Samuel|5|3|And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
1 Samuel|5|4|And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands {lay} cut off upon the threshold; only {the stump of} Dagon was left to him.
1 Samuel|5|5|Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.
1 Samuel|5|6|But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.
1 Samuel|5|7|And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
1 Samuel|5|8|They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel {thither}.
1 Samuel|5|9|And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.
1 Samuel|5|10|So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
1 Samuel|5|11|They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
1 Samuel|5|12|And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1 Samuel|6|1|And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel|6|2|And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place.
1 Samuel|6|3|And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
1 Samuel|6|4|Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, {according to} the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
1 Samuel|6|5|Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
1 Samuel|6|6|Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
1 Samuel|6|7|Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
1 Samuel|6|8|and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
1 Samuel|6|9|And see; if it goeth up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
1 Samuel|6|10|And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;
1 Samuel|6|11|and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
1 Samuel|6|12|And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel|6|13|And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
1 Samuel|6|14|And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|6|15|And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|6|16|And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
1 Samuel|6|17|And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
1 Samuel|6|18|and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah, {which stone remaineth} unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
1 Samuel|6|19|And he smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah, he smote of the people seventy men, {and} fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.
1 Samuel|6|20|And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
1 Samuel|6|21|And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.
1 Samuel|7|1|And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|2|And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|3|And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|4|Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.
1 Samuel|7|5|And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|6|And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
1 Samuel|7|7|And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|8|And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|9|And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto Jehovah: and Samuel cried unto Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him.
1 Samuel|7|10|And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.
1 Samuel|7|11|And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.
1 Samuel|7|12|Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.
1 Samuel|7|13|So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
1 Samuel|7|14|And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1 Samuel|7|15|And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel|7|16|And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
1 Samuel|7|17|And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an altar unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|8|1|And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel|8|2|Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
1 Samuel|8|3|And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
1 Samuel|8|4|Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;
1 Samuel|8|5|and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
1 Samuel|8|6|But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|8|7|And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.
1 Samuel|8|8|According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
1 Samuel|8|9|Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.
1 Samuel|8|10|And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel|8|11|And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
1 Samuel|8|12|and he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and {he will set some} to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
1 Samuel|8|13|And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
1 Samuel|8|14|And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel|8|15|And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1 Samuel|8|16|And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
1 Samuel|8|17|He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.
1 Samuel|8|18|And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
1 Samuel|8|19|But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,
1 Samuel|8|20|that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
1 Samuel|8|21|And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|8|22|And Jehovah said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.
1 Samuel|9|1|Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
1 Samuel|9|2|And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1 Samuel|9|3|And the asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
1 Samuel|9|4|And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.
1 Samuel|9|5|When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.
1 Samuel|9|6|And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
1 Samuel|9|7|Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
1 Samuel|9|8|And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
1 Samuel|9|9|(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
1 Samuel|9|10|Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
1 Samuel|9|11|As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
1 Samuel|9|12|And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, {he is} before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place:
1 Samuel|9|13|as soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; {and} afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.
1 Samuel|9|14|And they went up to the city; {and} as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
1 Samuel|9|15|Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
1 Samuel|9|16|To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
1 Samuel|9|17|And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.
1 Samuel|9|18|Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.
1 Samuel|9|19|And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
1 Samuel|9|20|And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father’s house?
1 Samuel|9|21|And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?
1 Samuel|9|22|And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.
1 Samuel|9|23|And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
1 Samuel|9|24|And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And {Samuel} said, Behold, that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
1 Samuel|9|25|And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.
1 Samuel|9|26|And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1 Samuel|9|27|As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still first, that I may cause thee to hear the word of God.
1 Samuel|10|1|Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?
1 Samuel|10|2|When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1 Samuel|10|3|Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
1 Samuel|10|4|and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.
1 Samuel|10|5|After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:
1 Samuel|10|6|and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
1 Samuel|10|7|And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.
1 Samuel|10|8|And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come unto thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.
1 Samuel|10|9|And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
1 Samuel|10|10|And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
1 Samuel|10|11|And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|12|And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|13|And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1 Samuel|10|14|And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.
1 Samuel|10|15|And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
1 Samuel|10|16|And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
1 Samuel|10|17|And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;
1 Samuel|10|18|and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
1 Samuel|10|19|but ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saveth you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and ye have said unto him, {Nay}, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
1 Samuel|10|20|So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1 Samuel|10|21|And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.
1 Samuel|10|22|Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
1 Samuel|10|23|And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1 Samuel|10|24|And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, {Long} live the king.
1 Samuel|10|25|Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
1 Samuel|10|26|And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.
1 Samuel|10|27|But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
1 Samuel|11|1|Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|11|2|And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1 Samuel|11|3|And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.
1 Samuel|11|4|Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|11|5|And, behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
1 Samuel|11|6|And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1 Samuel|11|7|And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
1 Samuel|11|8|And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1 Samuel|11|9|And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
1 Samuel|11|10|Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
1 Samuel|11|11|And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they that remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.
1 Samuel|11|12|And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1 Samuel|11|13|And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.
1 Samuel|11|14|Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
1 Samuel|11|15|And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel|12|1|And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|2|And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.
1 Samuel|12|3|Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
1 Samuel|12|4|And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.
1 Samuel|12|5|And he said unto them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they said, He is witness.
1 Samuel|12|6|And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|12|7|Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|8|When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
1 Samuel|12|9|But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
1 Samuel|12|10|And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|12|11|And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.
1 Samuel|12|12|And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.
1 Samuel|12|13|Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|14|If ye will fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken unto his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both ye and also the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God, {well}:
1 Samuel|12|15|but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|16|Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
1 Samuel|12|17|Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.
1 Samuel|12|18|So Samuel called unto Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
1 Samuel|12|19|And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto Jehovah thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins {this} evil, to ask us a king.
1 Samuel|12|20|And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:
1 Samuel|12|21|and turn ye not aside; for {then would ye go} after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
1 Samuel|12|22|For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.
1 Samuel|12|23|Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
1 Samuel|12|24|Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.
1 Samuel|12|25|But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.
1 Samuel|13|1|Saul was {forty} years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1 Samuel|13|2|Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
1 Samuel|13|3|And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1 Samuel|13|4|And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
1 Samuel|13|5|And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.
1 Samuel|13|6|When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
1 Samuel|13|7|Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1 Samuel|13|8|And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel {had appointed}: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
1 Samuel|13|9|And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|10|And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
1 Samuel|13|11|And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;
1 Samuel|13|12|therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|13|And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
1 Samuel|13|14|But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
1 Samuel|13|15|And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.      And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1 Samuel|13|16|And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1 Samuel|13|17|And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
1 Samuel|13|18|and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looketh down upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1 Samuel|13|19|Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
1 Samuel|13|20|but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
1 Samuel|13|21|yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
1 Samuel|13|22|So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
1 Samuel|13|23|And the garrison of the Philistines went out unto the pass of Michmash.
1 Samuel|14|1|Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father.
1 Samuel|14|2|And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1 Samuel|14|3|and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
1 Samuel|14|4|And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
1 Samuel|14|5|The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
1 Samuel|14|6|And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
1 Samuel|14|7|And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
1 Samuel|14|8|Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.
1 Samuel|14|9|If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
1 Samuel|14|10|But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.
1 Samuel|14|11|And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
1 Samuel|14|12|And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
1 Samuel|14|13|And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.
1 Samuel|14|14|And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.
1 Samuel|14|15|And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.
1 Samuel|14|16|And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went {hither} and thither.
1 Samuel|14|17|Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.
1 Samuel|14|18|And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was {there} at that time with the children of Israel.
1 Samuel|14|19|And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
1 Samuel|14|20|And Saul and all the people that were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, {and there was} a very great discomfiture.
1 Samuel|14|21|Now the Hebrews that were with the Philistines as beforetime, and that went up with them into the camp, {from the country} round about, even they also {turned} to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
1 Samuel|14|22|Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
1 Samuel|14|23|So Jehovah saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth-aven.
1 Samuel|14|24|And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
1 Samuel|14|25|And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.
1 Samuel|14|26|And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
1 Samuel|14|27|But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
1 Samuel|14|28|Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.
1 Samuel|14|29|Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
1 Samuel|14|30|How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now hath there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
1 Samuel|14|31|And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;
1 Samuel|14|32|and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.
1 Samuel|14|33|Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.
1 Samuel|14|34|And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
1 Samuel|14|35|And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah: the same was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|14|36|And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
1 Samuel|14|37|And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
1 Samuel|14|38|And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
1 Samuel|14|39|For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
1 Samuel|14|40|Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
1 Samuel|14|41|Therefore Saul said unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, Show the right. And Jonathan and Saul were taken {by lot}; but the people escaped.
1 Samuel|14|42|And Saul said, Cast {lots} between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
1 Samuel|14|43|Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.
1 Samuel|14|44|And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
1 Samuel|14|45|And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
1 Samuel|14|46|Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
1 Samuel|14|47|Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he put {them} to the worse.
1 Samuel|14|48|And he did valiantly, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that despoiled them.
1 Samuel|14|49|Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
1 Samuel|14|50|and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
1 Samuel|14|51|And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1 Samuel|14|52|And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
1 Samuel|15|1|And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
1 Samuel|15|3|Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
1 Samuel|15|4|And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1 Samuel|15|5|And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1 Samuel|15|6|And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel|15|7|And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.
1 Samuel|15|8|And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel|15|9|But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1 Samuel|15|10|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,
1 Samuel|15|11|It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.
1 Samuel|15|12|And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
1 Samuel|15|13|And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|14|And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1 Samuel|15|15|And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
1 Samuel|15|16|Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.
1 Samuel|15|17|And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;
1 Samuel|15|18|and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
1 Samuel|15|19|Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?
1 Samuel|15|20|And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
1 Samuel|15|21|But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
1 Samuel|15|22|And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
1 Samuel|15|23|For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
1 Samuel|15|24|And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
1 Samuel|15|25|Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|26|And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
1 Samuel|15|27|And as Samuel turned about to go away, {Saul} laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.
1 Samuel|15|28|And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.
1 Samuel|15|29|And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.
1 Samuel|15|30|Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
1 Samuel|15|31|So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|32|Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
1 Samuel|15|33|And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
1 Samuel|15|34|Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel|15|35|And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel|16|1|And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
1 Samuel|16|2|And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.
1 Samuel|16|3|And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
1 Samuel|16|4|And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
1 Samuel|16|5|And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto Jehovah: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel|16|6|And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him.
1 Samuel|16|7|But Jehovah said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for {Jehovah seeth} not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.
1 Samuel|16|8|Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.
1 Samuel|16|9|Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.
1 Samuel|16|10|And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.
1 Samuel|16|11|And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.
1 Samuel|16|12|And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
1 Samuel|16|13|Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel|16|14|Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
1 Samuel|16|15|And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
1 Samuel|16|16|Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
1 Samuel|16|17|And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
1 Samuel|16|18|Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.
1 Samuel|16|19|Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
1 Samuel|16|20|And Jesse took an ass {laden} with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
1 Samuel|16|21|And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.
1 Samuel|16|22|And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
1 Samuel|16|23|And it came to pass, when the {evil} spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1 Samuel|17|1|Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
1 Samuel|17|2|And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
1 Samuel|17|3|And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
1 Samuel|17|4|And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
1 Samuel|17|5|And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
1 Samuel|17|6|And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
1 Samuel|17|7|And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head {weighed} six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.
1 Samuel|17|8|And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
1 Samuel|17|9|If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
1 Samuel|17|10|And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
1 Samuel|17|11|And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1 Samuel|17|12|Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken {in years} among men.
1 Samuel|17|13|And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1 Samuel|17|14|And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel|17|15|Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.
1 Samuel|17|16|And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1 Samuel|17|17|And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry {them} quickly to the camp to thy brethren;
1 Samuel|17|18|and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
1 Samuel|17|19|Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
1 Samuel|17|20|And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
1 Samuel|17|21|And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
1 Samuel|17|22|And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
1 Samuel|17|23|And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
1 Samuel|17|24|And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
1 Samuel|17|25|And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.
1 Samuel|17|26|And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1 Samuel|17|27|And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
1 Samuel|17|28|And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
1 Samuel|17|29|And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1 Samuel|17|30|And he turned away from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1 Samuel|17|31|And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
1 Samuel|17|32|And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|33|And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
1 Samuel|17|34|And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,
1 Samuel|17|35|I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
1 Samuel|17|36|Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
1 Samuel|17|37|And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
1 Samuel|17|38|And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel|17|39|And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
1 Samuel|17|40|And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|41|And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
1 Samuel|17|42|And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.
1 Samuel|17|43|And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1 Samuel|17|44|And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
1 Samuel|17|45|Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
1 Samuel|17|46|This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
1 Samuel|17|47|and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand.
1 Samuel|17|48|And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|49|And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.
1 Samuel|17|50|So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1 Samuel|17|51|Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
1 Samuel|17|52|And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
1 Samuel|17|53|And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
1 Samuel|17|54|And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
1 Samuel|17|55|And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
1 Samuel|17|56|And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1 Samuel|17|57|And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1 Samuel|17|58|And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.
1 Samuel|18|1|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|2|And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.
1 Samuel|18|3|Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|4|And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
1 Samuel|18|5|And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, {and} behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
1 Samuel|18|6|And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.
1 Samuel|18|7|And the women sang one to another as they played, and said,             Saul hath slain his thousands,                   And David his ten thousands.
1 Samuel|18|8|And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1 Samuel|18|9|And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1 Samuel|18|10|And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;
1 Samuel|18|11|and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1 Samuel|18|12|And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.
1 Samuel|18|13|Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel|18|14|And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.
1 Samuel|18|15|And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
1 Samuel|18|16|But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.
1 Samuel|18|17|And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
1 Samuel|18|18|And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, {or} my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
1 Samuel|18|19|But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
1 Samuel|18|20|And Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1 Samuel|18|21|And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.
1 Samuel|18|22|And Saul commanded his servants, {saying}, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.
1 Samuel|18|23|And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
1 Samuel|18|24|And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
1 Samuel|18|25|And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|18|26|And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;
1 Samuel|18|27|and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
1 Samuel|18|28|And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
1 Samuel|18|29|And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually.
1 Samuel|18|30|Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
1 Samuel|19|1|And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.
1 Samuel|19|2|And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
1 Samuel|19|3|and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.
1 Samuel|19|4|And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
1 Samuel|19|5|for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
1 Samuel|19|6|And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.
1 Samuel|19|7|And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as beforetime.
1 Samuel|19|8|And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
1 Samuel|19|9|And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
1 Samuel|19|10|And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1 Samuel|19|11|And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.
1 Samuel|19|12|So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
1 Samuel|19|13|And Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ {hair} at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.
1 Samuel|19|14|And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1 Samuel|19|15|And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
1 Samuel|19|16|And when the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’ {hair} at the head thereof.
1 Samuel|19|17|And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me thus, and let mine enemy go, so that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
1 Samuel|19|18|Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1 Samuel|19|19|And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|20|And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel|19|21|And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel|19|22|Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|23|And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|24|And he also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|20|1|And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
1 Samuel|20|2|And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
1 Samuel|20|3|And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
1 Samuel|20|4|Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
1 Samuel|20|5|And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
1 Samuel|20|6|If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
1 Samuel|20|7|If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.
1 Samuel|20|8|Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
1 Samuel|20|9|And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
1 Samuel|20|10|Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?
1 Samuel|20|11|And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
1 Samuel|20|12|And Jonathan said unto David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, {be witness}: when I have sounded my father about this time to-morrow, {or} the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?
1 Samuel|20|13|Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
1 Samuel|20|14|And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;
1 Samuel|20|15|but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
1 Samuel|20|16|So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, {saying}, And Jehovah will require it at the hand of David’s enemies.
1 Samuel|20|17|And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1 Samuel|20|18|Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
1 Samuel|20|19|And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
1 Samuel|20|20|And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
1 Samuel|20|21|And, behold, I will send the lad, {saying}, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.
1 Samuel|20|22|But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.
1 Samuel|20|23|And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, Jehovah is between thee and me for ever.
1 Samuel|20|24|So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.
1 Samuel|20|25|And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.
1 Samuel|20|26|Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
1 Samuel|20|27|And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, {which was} the second {day}, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
1 Samuel|20|28|And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:
1 Samuel|20|29|and he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me {to be there}: and now, if I have found favor in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he is not come unto the king’s table.
1 Samuel|20|30|Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?
1 Samuel|20|31|For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
1 Samuel|20|32|And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?
1 Samuel|20|33|And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.
1 Samuel|20|34|So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
1 Samuel|20|35|And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
1 Samuel|20|36|And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
1 Samuel|20|37|And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
1 Samuel|20|38|And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
1 Samuel|20|39|But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1 Samuel|20|40|And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
1 Samuel|20|41|And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of {a place} toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
1 Samuel|20|42|And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
1 Samuel|21|1|Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
1 Samuel|21|2|And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.
1 Samuel|21|3|Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.
1 Samuel|21|4|And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.
1 Samuel|21|5|And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?
1 Samuel|21|6|So the priest gave him holy {bread}; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
1 Samuel|21|7|Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.
1 Samuel|21|8|And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.
1 Samuel|21|9|And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the vale of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
1 Samuel|21|10|And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel|21|11|And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying,             Saul hath slain his thousands,                   And David his ten thousands?
1 Samuel|21|12|And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel|21|13|And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
1 Samuel|21|14|Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
1 Samuel|21|15|Do I lack madmen, that ye have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
1 Samuel|22|1|David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.
1 Samuel|22|2|And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
1 Samuel|22|3|And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, {and be} with you, till I know what God will do for me.
1 Samuel|22|4|And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
1 Samuel|22|5|And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
1 Samuel|22|6|And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
1 Samuel|22|7|And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
1 Samuel|22|8|that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1 Samuel|22|9|Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
1 Samuel|22|10|And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
1 Samuel|22|11|Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
1 Samuel|22|12|And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
1 Samuel|22|13|And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1 Samuel|22|14|Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?
1 Samuel|22|15|Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.
1 Samuel|22|16|And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.
1 Samuel|22|17|And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|22|18|And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
1 Samuel|22|19|And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel|22|20|And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
1 Samuel|22|21|And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah’s priests.
1 Samuel|22|22|And David said unto Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned {the death} of all the persons of thy father’s house.
1 Samuel|22|23|Abide thou with me, fear not; for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: for with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
1 Samuel|23|1|And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.
1 Samuel|23|2|Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|3|And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1 Samuel|23|4|Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
1 Samuel|23|5|And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|6|And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1 Samuel|23|7|And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
1 Samuel|23|8|And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1 Samuel|23|9|And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
1 Samuel|23|10|Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
1 Samuel|23|11|Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
1 Samuel|23|12|Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.
1 Samuel|23|13|Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
1 Samuel|23|14|And David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
1 Samuel|23|15|And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
1 Samuel|23|16|And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
1 Samuel|23|17|And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
1 Samuel|23|18|And they two made a covenant before Jehovah: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
1 Samuel|23|19|Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
1 Samuel|23|20|Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.
1 Samuel|23|21|And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.
1 Samuel|23|22|Go, I pray you, make yet more sure, and know and see his place where his haunt is, {and} who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.
1 Samuel|23|23|See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
1 Samuel|23|24|And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
1 Samuel|23|25|And Saul and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard {that}, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1 Samuel|23|26|And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
1 Samuel|23|27|But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.
1 Samuel|23|28|So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
1 Samuel|23|29|And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1 Samuel|24|1|And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
1 Samuel|24|2|Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1 Samuel|24|3|And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
1 Samuel|24|4|And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
1 Samuel|24|5|And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
1 Samuel|24|6|And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|7|So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
1 Samuel|24|8|David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
1 Samuel|24|9|And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
1 Samuel|24|10|Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee; but {mine eye} spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|11|Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.
1 Samuel|24|12|Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|13|As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|14|After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
1 Samuel|24|15|Jehovah therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
1 Samuel|24|16|And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|24|17|And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.
1 Samuel|24|18|And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.
1 Samuel|24|19|For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.
1 Samuel|24|20|And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
1 Samuel|24|21|Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.
1 Samuel|24|22|And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the stronghold.
1 Samuel|25|1|And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1 Samuel|25|2|And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|3|Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
1 Samuel|25|4|And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel|25|5|And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
1 Samuel|25|6|and thus shall ye say to him that liveth {in prosperity}, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
1 Samuel|25|7|And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|8|Ask thy young men, and they will tell thee: wherefore let the young men find favor in thine eyes; for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
1 Samuel|25|9|And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
1 Samuel|25|10|And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.
1 Samuel|25|11|Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?
1 Samuel|25|12|So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
1 Samuel|25|13|And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
1 Samuel|25|14|But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
1 Samuel|25|15|But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:
1 Samuel|25|16|they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
1 Samuel|25|17|Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for he is such a worthless fellow, that one cannot speak to him.
1 Samuel|25|18|Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
1 Samuel|25|19|And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|20|And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
1 Samuel|25|21|Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.
1 Samuel|25|22|God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light so much as one man-child.
1 Samuel|25|23|And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
1 Samuel|25|24|And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.
1 Samuel|25|25|Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
1 Samuel|25|26|Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|27|And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
1 Samuel|25|28|Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.
1 Samuel|25|29|And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
1 Samuel|25|30|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,
1 Samuel|25|31|that this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
1 Samuel|25|32|And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:
1 Samuel|25|33|and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
1 Samuel|25|34|For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.
1 Samuel|25|35|So David received of her hand that which she had brought him: and he said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
1 Samuel|25|36|And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1 Samuel|25|37|And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1 Samuel|25|38|And it came to pass about ten days after, that Jehovah smote Nabal, so that he died.
1 Samuel|25|39|And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|40|And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|41|And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1 Samuel|25|42|And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1 Samuel|25|43|David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.
1 Samuel|25|44|Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1 Samuel|26|1|And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
1 Samuel|26|2|Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1 Samuel|26|3|And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
1 Samuel|26|4|David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.
1 Samuel|26|5|And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.
1 Samuel|26|6|Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1 Samuel|26|7|So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
1 Samuel|26|8|Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.
1 Samuel|26|9|And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah’s anointed, and be guiltless?
1 Samuel|26|10|And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
1 Samuel|26|11|Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
1 Samuel|26|12|So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s head; and they gat them away: and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah was fallen upon them.
1 Samuel|26|13|Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
1 Samuel|26|14|and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
1 Samuel|26|15|And David said to Abner, Art not thou a {valiant} man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
1 Samuel|26|16|This thing is not good that thou hast done. As Jehovah liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept watch over your lord, Jehovah’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his head.
1 Samuel|26|17|And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1 Samuel|26|18|And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
1 Samuel|26|19|Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
1 Samuel|26|20|Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Jehovah: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
1 Samuel|26|21|Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
1 Samuel|26|22|And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.
1 Samuel|26|23|And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|26|24|And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
1 Samuel|26|25|Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do mightily, and shalt surely prevail. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1 Samuel|27|1|And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
1 Samuel|27|2|And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1 Samuel|27|3|And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
1 Samuel|27|4|And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1 Samuel|27|5|And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
1 Samuel|27|6|Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
1 Samuel|27|7|And the number of the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1 Samuel|27|8|And David and his men went up, and made a raid upon the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those {nations} were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|27|9|And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.
1 Samuel|27|10|And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
1 Samuel|27|11|And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|27|12|And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1 Samuel|28|1|And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.
1 Samuel|28|2|And David said to Achish, Therefore thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.
1 Samuel|28|3|Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1 Samuel|28|4|And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
1 Samuel|28|5|And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
1 Samuel|28|6|And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
1 Samuel|28|7|Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
1 Samuel|28|8|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.
1 Samuel|28|9|And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1 Samuel|28|10|And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
1 Samuel|28|11|Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1 Samuel|28|12|And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
1 Samuel|28|13|And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
1 Samuel|28|14|And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.
1 Samuel|28|15|And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
1 Samuel|28|16|And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?
1 Samuel|28|17|And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.
1 Samuel|28|18|Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.
1 Samuel|28|19|Moreover Jehovah will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: Jehovah will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|28|20|Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
1 Samuel|28|21|And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
1 Samuel|28|22|Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
1 Samuel|28|23|But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1 Samuel|28|24|And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
1 Samuel|28|25|and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
1 Samuel|29|1|Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.
1 Samuel|29|2|And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
1 Samuel|29|3|Then said the princes of the Philistines, What {do} these Hebrews {here}? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or {rather} these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away {unto me} unto this day?
1 Samuel|29|4|But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for wherewith should this {fellow} reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?
1 Samuel|29|5|Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying,             Saul hath slain his thousands,                    And David his ten thousands?
1 Samuel|29|6|Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
1 Samuel|29|7|Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|29|8|And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1 Samuel|29|9|And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1 Samuel|29|10|Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
1 Samuel|29|11|So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1 Samuel|30|1|And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
1 Samuel|30|2|and had taken captive the women {and all} that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.
1 Samuel|30|3|And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
1 Samuel|30|4|Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
1 Samuel|30|5|And David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
1 Samuel|30|6|And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.
1 Samuel|30|7|And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
1 Samuel|30|8|And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake {them}, and shalt without fail recover {all}.
1 Samuel|30|9|So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
1 Samuel|30|10|But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1 Samuel|30|11|And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink.
1 Samuel|30|12|And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
1 Samuel|30|13|And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
1 Samuel|30|14|We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1 Samuel|30|15|And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
1 Samuel|30|16|And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
1 Samuel|30|17|And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.
1 Samuel|30|18|And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel|30|19|And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.
1 Samuel|30|20|And David took all the flocks and the herds, {which} they drove before those {other} cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.
1 Samuel|30|21|And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
1 Samuel|30|22|Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.
1 Samuel|30|23|Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
1 Samuel|30|24|And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.
1 Samuel|30|25|And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
1 Samuel|30|26|And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:
1 Samuel|30|27|To them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,
1 Samuel|30|28|and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,
1 Samuel|30|29|and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,
1 Samuel|30|30|and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,
1 Samuel|30|31|and to them that were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.
1 Samuel|31|1|Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|2|And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Samuel|31|3|And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
1 Samuel|31|4|Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
1 Samuel|31|5|And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.
1 Samuel|31|6|So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
1 Samuel|31|7|And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1 Samuel|31|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|9|And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.
1 Samuel|31|10|And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
1 Samuel|31|11|And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Samuel|31|12|all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
1 Samuel|31|13|And they took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk-tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Deuteronomy|1|1|These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
Deuteronomy|1|2|It is eleven days’ {journey} from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|3|And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them;
Deuteronomy|1|4|after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|1|5|Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|6|Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:
Deuteronomy|1|7|turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all {the places} nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy|1|8|Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
Deuteronomy|1|9|And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
Deuteronomy|1|10|Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy|1|11|Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!
Deuteronomy|1|12|How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
Deuteronomy|1|13|Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
Deuteronomy|1|14|And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good {for us} to do.
Deuteronomy|1|15|So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
Deuteronomy|1|16|And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear {the causes} between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.
Deuteronomy|1|17|Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.
Deuteronomy|1|18|And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Deuteronomy|1|19|And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|20|And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy|1|21|Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy|1|22|And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.
Deuteronomy|1|23|And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
Deuteronomy|1|24|and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
Deuteronomy|1|25|And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy|1|26|Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:
Deuteronomy|1|27|and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Deuteronomy|1|28|Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
Deuteronomy|1|29|Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy|1|30|Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
Deuteronomy|1|31|and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.
Deuteronomy|1|32|Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
Deuteronomy|1|33|who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
Deuteronomy|1|34|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|35|Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
Deuteronomy|1|36|save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|1|37|Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:
Deuteronomy|1|38|Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|1|39|Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy|1|40|But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
Deuteronomy|1|41|Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|42|And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
Deuteronomy|1|43|So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|44|And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.
Deuteronomy|1|45|And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
Deuteronomy|1|46|So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode {there}.
Deuteronomy|2|1|Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.
Deuteronomy|2|2|And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|3|Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy|2|4|And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;
Deuteronomy|2|5|contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|6|Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
Deuteronomy|2|7|For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy|2|8|So we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion-geber.      And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy|2|9|And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|10|(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
Deuteronomy|2|11|these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy|2|12|The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.)
Deuteronomy|2|13|Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy|2|14|And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them.
Deuteronomy|2|15|Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
Deuteronomy|2|16|So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
Deuteronomy|2|17|that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|18|Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
Deuteronomy|2|19|and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|20|(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
Deuteronomy|2|21|a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;
Deuteronomy|2|22|as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
Deuteronomy|2|23|and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
Deuteronomy|2|24|Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy|2|25|This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
Deuteronomy|2|26|And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|27|Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left.
Deuteronomy|2|28|Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,
Deuteronomy|2|29|as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.
Deuteronomy|2|30|But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|2|31|And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
Deuteronomy|2|32|Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy|2|33|And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
Deuteronomy|2|34|And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:
Deuteronomy|2|35|only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
Deuteronomy|2|36|From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and {from} the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:
Deuteronomy|2|37|only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wheresoever Jehovah our God forbade us.
Deuteronomy|3|1|Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|3|2|And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
Deuteronomy|3|3|So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
Deuteronomy|3|4|And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy|3|5|All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.
Deuteronomy|3|6|And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
Deuteronomy|3|7|But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.
Deuteronomy|3|8|And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon;
Deuteronomy|3|9|({which} Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir);
Deuteronomy|3|10|all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy|3|11|(For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.)
Deuteronomy|3|12|And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
Deuteronomy|3|13|and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
Deuteronomy|3|14|Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)
Deuteronomy|3|15|And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
Deuteronomy|3|16|And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border {thereof}, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
Deuteronomy|3|17|the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border {thereof}, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
Deuteronomy|3|18|And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valor.
Deuteronomy|3|19|But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you,
Deuteronomy|3|20|until Jehovah give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
Deuteronomy|3|21|And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.
Deuteronomy|3|22|Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you.
Deuteronomy|3|23|And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy|3|24|O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?
Deuteronomy|3|25|Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
Deuteronomy|3|26|But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
Deuteronomy|3|27|Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy|3|28|But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
Deuteronomy|3|29|So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy|4|1|And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you.
Deuteronomy|4|2|Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.
Deuteronomy|4|3|Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|4|4|But ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy|4|5|Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|4|6|Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
Deuteronomy|4|7|For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him?
Deuteronomy|4|8|And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
Deuteronomy|4|9|Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children;
Deuteronomy|4|10|the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
Deuteronomy|4|11|And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
Deuteronomy|4|12|And Jehovah spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but ye saw no form; only {ye heard} a voice.
Deuteronomy|4|13|And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
Deuteronomy|4|14|And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
Deuteronomy|4|15|Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy|4|16|Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
Deuteronomy|4|17|the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens,
Deuteronomy|4|18|the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
Deuteronomy|4|19|and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.
Deuteronomy|4|20|But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|4|21|Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:
Deuteronomy|4|22|but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
Deuteronomy|4|23|Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee.
Deuteronomy|4|24|For Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
Deuteronomy|4|25|When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger;
Deuteronomy|4|26|I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
Deuteronomy|4|27|And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away.
Deuteronomy|4|28|And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
Deuteronomy|4|29|But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy|4|30|When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice:
Deuteronomy|4|31|for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God; he will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.
Deuteronomy|4|32|For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been {any such thing} as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
Deuteronomy|4|33|Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
Deuteronomy|4|34|Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of {another} nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Deuteronomy|4|35|Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him.
Deuteronomy|4|36|Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy|4|37|And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;
Deuteronomy|4|38|to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|4|39|Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.
Deuteronomy|4|40|And thou shalt keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days in the land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, for ever.
Deuteronomy|4|41|Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy|4|42|that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
Deuteronomy|4|43|{namely}, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
Deuteronomy|4|44|And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
Deuteronomy|4|45|these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,
Deuteronomy|4|46|beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|4|47|And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy|4|48|from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
Deuteronomy|4|49|and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy|5|1|And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.
Deuteronomy|5|2|Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy|5|3|Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
Deuteronomy|5|4|Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy|5|5|(I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to show you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,
Deuteronomy|5|6|I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|5|7|Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Deuteronomy|5|8|Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, {nor} any likeness {of anything} that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
Deuteronomy|5|9|thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;
Deuteronomy|5|10|and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
Deuteronomy|5|11|Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
Deuteronomy|5|12|Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
Deuteronomy|5|13|Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
Deuteronomy|5|14|but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
Deuteronomy|5|15|And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
Deuteronomy|5|16|Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee; that thy days may be long, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy|5|17|Thou shalt not kill.
Deuteronomy|5|18|Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
Deuteronomy|5|19|Neither shalt thou steal.
Deuteronomy|5|20|Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Deuteronomy|5|21|Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor’s wife; neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor’s house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor’s.
Deuteronomy|5|22|These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy|5|23|And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
Deuteronomy|5|24|and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.
Deuteronomy|5|25|Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die.
Deuteronomy|5|26|For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Deuteronomy|5|27|Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
Deuteronomy|5|28|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|5|29|Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
Deuteronomy|5|30|Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.
Deuteronomy|5|31|But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
Deuteronomy|5|32|Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deuteronomy|5|33|Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
Deuteronomy|6|1|Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|6|2|that thou mightest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Deuteronomy|6|3|Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|6|4|Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:
Deuteronomy|6|5|and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
Deuteronomy|6|6|And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;
Deuteronomy|6|7|and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|6|8|And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.
Deuteronomy|6|9|And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
Deuteronomy|6|10|And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,
Deuteronomy|6|11|and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;
Deuteronomy|6|12|then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|6|13|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.
Deuteronomy|6|14|Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;
Deuteronomy|6|15|for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|6|16|Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
Deuteronomy|6|17|Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
Deuteronomy|6|18|And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,
Deuteronomy|6|19|to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Deuteronomy|6|20|When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?
Deuteronomy|6|21|then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
Deuteronomy|6|22|and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;
Deuteronomy|6|23|and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
Deuteronomy|6|24|And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|6|25|And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded us.
Deuteronomy|7|1|When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
Deuteronomy|7|2|and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;
Deuteronomy|7|3|neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
Deuteronomy|7|4|For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
Deuteronomy|7|5|But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy|7|6|For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|7|7|Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:
Deuteronomy|7|8|but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|7|9|Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
Deuteronomy|7|10|and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
Deuteronomy|7|11|Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
Deuteronomy|7|12|And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:
Deuteronomy|7|13|and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
Deuteronomy|7|14|Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy|7|15|And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
Deuteronomy|7|16|And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
Deuteronomy|7|17|If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
Deuteronomy|7|18|thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
Deuteronomy|7|19|the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.
Deuteronomy|7|20|Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.
Deuteronomy|7|21|Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.
Deuteronomy|7|22|And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
Deuteronomy|7|23|But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.
Deuteronomy|7|24|And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy|7|25|The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|7|26|And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
Deuteronomy|8|1|All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers.
Deuteronomy|8|2|And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.
Deuteronomy|8|3|And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.
Deuteronomy|8|4|Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
Deuteronomy|8|5|And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.
Deuteronomy|8|6|And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
Deuteronomy|8|7|For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy|8|8|a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;
Deuteronomy|8|9|a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper.
Deuteronomy|8|10|And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|8|11|Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
Deuteronomy|8|12|lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
Deuteronomy|8|13|and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
Deuteronomy|8|14|then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
Deuteronomy|8|15|who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, {wherein were} fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
Deuteronomy|8|16|who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:
Deuteronomy|8|17|and {lest} thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
Deuteronomy|8|18|But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|8|19|And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy|8|20|As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|9|1|Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
Deuteronomy|9|2|a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Deuteronomy|9|3|Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee.
Deuteronomy|9|4|Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|9|5|Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Deuteronomy|9|6|Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
Deuteronomy|9|7|Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|9|8|Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|9|When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
Deuteronomy|9|10|And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them {was written} according to all the words, which Jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy|9|11|And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
Deuteronomy|9|12|And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
Deuteronomy|9|13|Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Deuteronomy|9|14|let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
Deuteronomy|9|15|So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy|9|16|And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
Deuteronomy|9|17|And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy|9|18|And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
Deuteronomy|9|19|For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.
Deuteronomy|9|20|And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
Deuteronomy|9|21|And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
Deuteronomy|9|22|And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.
Deuteronomy|9|23|And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
Deuteronomy|9|24|Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.
Deuteronomy|9|25|So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|26|And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy|9|27|Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,
Deuteronomy|9|28|lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Deuteronomy|9|29|Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.
Deuteronomy|10|1|At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy|10|2|And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
Deuteronomy|10|3|So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
Deuteronomy|10|4|And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy|10|5|And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me.
Deuteronomy|10|6|(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.
Deuteronomy|10|7|From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
Deuteronomy|10|8|At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
Deuteronomy|10|9|Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)
Deuteronomy|10|10|And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.
Deuteronomy|10|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
Deuteronomy|10|12|And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
Deuteronomy|10|13|to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
Deuteronomy|10|14|Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
Deuteronomy|10|15|Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|10|16|Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
Deuteronomy|10|17|For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
Deuteronomy|10|18|He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.
Deuteronomy|10|19|Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|10|20|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
Deuteronomy|10|21|He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy|10|22|Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy|11|1|Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.
Deuteronomy|11|2|And know ye this day: for {I speak} not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,
Deuteronomy|11|3|and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy|11|4|and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;
Deuteronomy|11|5|and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;
Deuteronomy|11|6|and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
Deuteronomy|11|7|but your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he did.
Deuteronomy|11|8|Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|11|9|and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|11|10|For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;
Deuteronomy|11|11|but the land, whither ye go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, {and} drinketh water of the rain of heaven,
Deuteronomy|11|12|a land which Jehovah thy God careth for: the eyes of Jehovah thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.
Deuteronomy|11|13|And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy|11|14|that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil.
Deuteronomy|11|15|And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.
Deuteronomy|11|16|Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
Deuteronomy|11|17|and the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah giveth you.
Deuteronomy|11|18|Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
Deuteronomy|11|19|And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|11|20|And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;
Deuteronomy|11|21|that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
Deuteronomy|11|22|For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
Deuteronomy|11|23|then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
Deuteronomy|11|24|Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.
Deuteronomy|11|25|There shall no man be able to stand before you: Jehovah your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath spoken unto you.
Deuteronomy|11|26|Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
Deuteronomy|11|27|the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;
Deuteronomy|11|28|and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
Deuteronomy|11|29|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy|11|30|Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
Deuteronomy|11|31|For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
Deuteronomy|11|32|And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
Deuteronomy|12|1|These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
Deuteronomy|12|2|Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
Deuteronomy|12|3|and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy|12|4|Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|12|5|But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;
Deuteronomy|12|6|and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:
Deuteronomy|12|7|and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.
Deuteronomy|12|8|Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;
Deuteronomy|12|9|for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy|12|10|But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
Deuteronomy|12|11|then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|12|And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy|12|13|Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;
Deuteronomy|12|14|but in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
Deuteronomy|12|15|Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
Deuteronomy|12|16|Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|17|Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;
Deuteronomy|12|18|but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|12|19|Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest in thy land.
Deuteronomy|12|20|When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|21|If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|22|Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.
Deuteronomy|12|23|Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|24|Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|25|Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|26|Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose:
Deuteronomy|12|27|and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|28|Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|12|29|When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;
Deuteronomy|12|30|take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
Deuteronomy|12|31|Thou shalt not do so unto Jehovah thy God: for every abomination to Jehovah, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.
Deuteronomy|12|32|What thing soever I command you, that shall ye observe to do: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
Deuteronomy|13|1|If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,
Deuteronomy|13|2|and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
Deuteronomy|13|3|thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy|13|4|Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
Deuteronomy|13|5|And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, to draw thee aside out of the way which Jehovah thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|13|6|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|13|7|of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
Deuteronomy|13|8|thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
Deuteronomy|13|9|but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
Deuteronomy|13|10|And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|13|11|And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do not more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|13|12|If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,
Deuteronomy|13|13|Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
Deuteronomy|13|14|then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,
Deuteronomy|13|15|thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy|13|16|And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again.
Deuteronomy|13|17|And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|13|18|when thou shalt hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|14|1|Ye are the children of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
Deuteronomy|14|2|For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God, and Jehovah hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|14|3|Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
Deuteronomy|14|4|These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
Deuteronomy|14|5|the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois.
Deuteronomy|14|6|And every beast that parteth the hoof, and hath the hoof cloven in two, {and} cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Deuteronomy|14|7|Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you.
Deuteronomy|14|8|And the swine, because he parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you: of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch.
Deuteronomy|14|9|These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat;
Deuteronomy|14|10|and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat; it is unclean unto you.
Deuteronomy|14|11|Of all clean birds ye may eat.
Deuteronomy|14|12|But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Deuteronomy|14|13|and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|14|and every raven after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|15|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|16|the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
Deuteronomy|14|17|and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
Deuteronomy|14|18|and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Deuteronomy|14|19|And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy|14|20|Of all clean birds ye may eat.
Deuteronomy|14|21|Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou mayest give it unto the sojourner that is within thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto a foreigner: for thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
Deuteronomy|14|22|Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which cometh forth from the field year by year.
Deuteronomy|14|23|And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always.
Deuteronomy|14|24|And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee;
Deuteronomy|14|25|then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose:
Deuteronomy|14|26|and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household.
Deuteronomy|14|27|And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.
Deuteronomy|14|28|At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
Deuteronomy|14|29|and the Levite, because he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.
Deuteronomy|15|1|At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
Deuteronomy|15|2|And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah’s release hath been proclaimed.
Deuteronomy|15|3|Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.
Deuteronomy|15|4|Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;)
Deuteronomy|15|5|if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy|15|6|For Jehovah thy God will bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.
Deuteronomy|15|7|If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;
Deuteronomy|15|8|but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need {in that} which he wanteth.
Deuteronomy|15|9|Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
Deuteronomy|15|10|Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|15|11|For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy brother, to thy needy, and to thy poor, in thy land.
Deuteronomy|15|12|If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
Deuteronomy|15|13|And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:
Deuteronomy|15|14|thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.
Deuteronomy|15|15|And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day.
Deuteronomy|15|16|And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;
Deuteronomy|15|17|then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.
Deuteronomy|15|18|It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou lettest him go free from thee; for to the double of the hire of a hireling hath he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest.
Deuteronomy|15|19|All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.
Deuteronomy|15|20|Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household.
Deuteronomy|15|21|And if it have any blemish, {as if it be} lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|15|22|Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean {shall eat it} alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
Deuteronomy|15|23|Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water.
Deuteronomy|16|1|Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto Jehovah thy God; for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.
Deuteronomy|16|2|And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto Jehovah thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
Deuteronomy|16|3|Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
Deuteronomy|16|4|And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
Deuteronomy|16|5|Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee;
Deuteronomy|16|6|but at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|16|7|And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.
Deuteronomy|16|8|Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work {therein}.
Deuteronomy|16|9|Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks.
Deuteronomy|16|10|And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as Jehovah thy God blesseth thee:
Deuteronomy|16|11|and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
Deuteronomy|16|12|And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
Deuteronomy|16|13|Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress:
Deuteronomy|16|14|and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.
Deuteronomy|16|15|Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; because Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful.
Deuteronomy|16|16|Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty:
Deuteronomy|16|17|every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|16|18|Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, according to thy tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
Deuteronomy|16|19|Thou shalt not wrest justice: thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a bribe; for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
Deuteronomy|16|20|That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy|16|21|Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou shalt make thee.
Deuteronomy|16|22|Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar; which Jehovah thy God hateth.
Deuteronomy|17|1|Thou shalt not sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God an ox, or a sheep, wherein is a blemish, {or} anything evil; for that is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|17|2|If there be found in the midst of thee, within any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that doeth that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, in transgressing his covenant,
Deuteronomy|17|3|and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;
Deuteronomy|17|4|and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,
Deuteronomy|17|5|then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who hath done this evil thing, unto thy gates, even the man or the woman; and thou shalt stone them to death with stones.
Deuteronomy|17|6|At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
Deuteronomy|17|7|The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|17|8|If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates; then shalt thou arise, and get thee up unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose;
Deuteronomy|17|9|and thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days: and thou shalt inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment.
Deuteronomy|17|10|And thou shalt do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they shall teach thee:
Deuteronomy|17|11|according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.
Deuteronomy|17|12|And the man that doeth presumptuously, in not hearkening unto the priest that standeth to minister there before Jehovah thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy|17|13|And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
Deuteronomy|17|14|When thou art come unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are round about me;
Deuteronomy|17|15|thou shalt surely set him king over thee, whom Jehovah thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee; thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother.
Deuteronomy|17|16|Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses; forasmuch as Jehovah hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.
Deuteronomy|17|17|Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
Deuteronomy|17|18|And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book, out of {that which is} before the priests the Levites:
Deuteronomy|17|19|and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;
Deuteronomy|17|20|that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
Deuteronomy|18|1|The priests the Levites, {even} all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.
Deuteronomy|18|2|And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.
Deuteronomy|18|3|And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
Deuteronomy|18|4|The first-fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
Deuteronomy|18|5|For Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Jehovah, him and his sons for ever.
Deuteronomy|18|6|And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah shall choose;
Deuteronomy|18|7|then he shall minister in the name of Jehovah his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|18|8|They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
Deuteronomy|18|9|When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
Deuteronomy|18|10|There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
Deuteronomy|18|11|or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
Deuteronomy|18|12|For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|18|13|Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|18|14|For these nations, that thou shalt dispossess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners; but as for thee, Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
Deuteronomy|18|15|Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;
Deuteronomy|18|16|according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.
Deuteronomy|18|17|And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|18|18|I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
Deuteronomy|18|19|And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
Deuteronomy|18|20|But the prophet, that shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
Deuteronomy|18|21|And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah hath not spoken?
Deuteronomy|18|22|when a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.
Deuteronomy|19|1|When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations, whose land Jehovah thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
Deuteronomy|19|2|thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.
Deuteronomy|19|3|Thou shalt prepare thee the way, and divide the borders of thy land, which Jehovah thy God causeth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee thither.
Deuteronomy|19|4|And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;
Deuteronomy|19|5|as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:
Deuteronomy|19|6|lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
Deuteronomy|19|7|Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.
Deuteronomy|19|8|And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|19|9|if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
Deuteronomy|19|10|that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
Deuteronomy|19|11|But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;
Deuteronomy|19|12|then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
Deuteronomy|19|13|Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
Deuteronomy|19|14|Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it.
Deuteronomy|19|15|One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
Deuteronomy|19|16|If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,
Deuteronomy|19|17|then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;
Deuteronomy|19|18|and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;
Deuteronomy|19|19|then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|19|20|And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|19|21|And thine eyes shall not pity; life {shall go} for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
Deuteronomy|20|1|When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, {and} a people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for Jehovah thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|20|2|And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
Deuteronomy|20|3|and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them;
Deuteronomy|20|4|for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
Deuteronomy|20|5|And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
Deuteronomy|20|6|And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not used the fruit thereof? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit thereof.
Deuteronomy|20|7|And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
Deuteronomy|20|8|And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart.
Deuteronomy|20|9|And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people.
Deuteronomy|20|10|When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
Deuteronomy|20|11|And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.
Deuteronomy|20|12|And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
Deuteronomy|20|13|and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
Deuteronomy|20|14|but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|20|15|Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
Deuteronomy|20|16|But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;
Deuteronomy|20|17|but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;
Deuteronomy|20|18|that they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so would ye sin against Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|20|19|When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee?
Deuteronomy|20|20|Only the trees of which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it fall.
Deuteronomy|21|1|If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;
Deuteronomy|21|2|then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:
Deuteronomy|21|3|and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
Deuteronomy|21|4|and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
Deuteronomy|21|5|And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
Deuteronomy|21|6|And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;
Deuteronomy|21|7|and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
Deuteronomy|21|8|Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood {to remain} in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
Deuteronomy|21|9|So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|21|10|When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,
Deuteronomy|21|11|and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;
Deuteronomy|21|12|then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
Deuteronomy|21|13|and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
Deuteronomy|21|14|And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.
Deuteronomy|21|15|If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;
Deuteronomy|21|16|then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:
Deuteronomy|21|17|but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.
Deuteronomy|21|18|If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;
Deuteronomy|21|19|then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
Deuteronomy|21|20|and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
Deuteronomy|21|21|And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
Deuteronomy|21|22|And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;
Deuteronomy|21|23|his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
Deuteronomy|22|1|Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother.
Deuteronomy|22|2|And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him.
Deuteronomy|22|3|And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself.
Deuteronomy|22|4|Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
Deuteronomy|22|5|A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|22|6|If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
Deuteronomy|22|7|thou shalt surely let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.
Deuteronomy|22|8|When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thy house, if any man fall from thence.
Deuteronomy|22|9|Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
Deuteronomy|22|10|Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
Deuteronomy|22|11|Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, wool and linen together.
Deuteronomy|22|12|Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
Deuteronomy|22|13|If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
Deuteronomy|22|14|and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity;
Deuteronomy|22|15|then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate;
Deuteronomy|22|16|and the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
Deuteronomy|22|17|and, lo, he hath laid shameful things {to her charge}, saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
Deuteronomy|22|18|And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;
Deuteronomy|22|19|and they shall fine him a hundred {shekels} of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
Deuteronomy|22|20|But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel;
Deuteronomy|22|21|then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|22|22|If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy|22|23|If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
Deuteronomy|22|24|then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them to death with stones; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor’s wife: so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|22|25|But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:
Deuteronomy|22|26|but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter;
Deuteronomy|22|27|for he found her in the field, the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
Deuteronomy|22|28|If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
Deuteronomy|22|29|then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty {shekels} of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he hath humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
Deuteronomy|22|30|A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.
Deuteronomy|23|1|He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|23|2|A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|23|3|An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:
Deuteronomy|23|4|because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
Deuteronomy|23|5|Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee.
Deuteronomy|23|6|Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
Deuteronomy|23|7|Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner in his land.
Deuteronomy|23|8|The children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|23|9|When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing.
Deuteronomy|23|10|If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of that which chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
Deuteronomy|23|11|but it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.
Deuteronomy|23|12|Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
Deuteronomy|23|13|and thou shalt have a paddle among thy weapons; and it shall be, when thou sittest down abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:
Deuteronomy|23|14|for Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
Deuteronomy|23|15|Thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee:

Deuteronomy|23|17|There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy|23|18|Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|23|19|Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of anything that is lent upon interest:
Deuteronomy|23|20|unto a foreigner thou mayest lend upon interest; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest, that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all that thou puttest thy hand unto, in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|23|21|When thou shalt vow a vow unto Jehovah thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it: for Jehovah thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
Deuteronomy|23|22|But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
Deuteronomy|23|23|That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt observe and do; according as thou hast vowed unto Jehovah thy God, a freewill-offering, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
Deuteronomy|23|24|When thou comest into thy neighbor’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat of grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.

Deuteronomy|24|1|When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

Deuteronomy|29|15|but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day

Deuteronomy|29|26|and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:
Deuteronomy|29|27|therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;
Deuteronomy|29|28|and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|29|29|The secret things belong unto Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy|30|1|And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,
Deuteronomy|30|2|and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
Deuteronomy|30|3|that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.
Deuteronomy|30|4|If {any of} thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
Deuteronomy|30|5|and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
Deuteronomy|30|6|And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
Deuteronomy|30|7|And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.
Deuteronomy|30|8|And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy|30|9|And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|30|10|if thou shalt obey the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy|30|11|For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
Deuteronomy|30|12|It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|13|Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|14|But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
Deuteronomy|30|15|See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
Deuteronomy|30|16|in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|17|But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
Deuteronomy|30|18|I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|19|I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;
Deuteronomy|30|20|to love Jehovah thy God, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
Deuteronomy|31|1|And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|2|And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy|31|3|Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee; he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt dispossess them: {and} Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Deuteronomy|31|4|And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.
Deuteronomy|31|5|And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy|31|6|Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Deuteronomy|31|7|And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|31|8|And Jehovah, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy|31|9|And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|10|And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of {every} seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
Deuteronomy|31|11|when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy|31|12|Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
Deuteronomy|31|13|and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Jehovah your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy|31|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy|31|15|And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
Deuteronomy|31|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy|31|17|Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
Deuteronomy|31|18|And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
Deuteronomy|31|19|Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|20|For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
Deuteronomy|31|21|And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
Deuteronomy|31|22|So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|23|And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
Deuteronomy|31|24|And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
Deuteronomy|31|25|that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
Deuteronomy|31|26|Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
Deuteronomy|31|27|For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?
Deuteronomy|31|28|Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
Deuteronomy|31|29|For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy|31|30|And Moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.
Deuteronomy|32|1|Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;                   And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
Deuteronomy|32|2|My doctrine shall drop as the rain;                   My speech shall distil as the dew,                   As the small rain upon the tender grass,                   And as the showers upon the herb.
Deuteronomy|32|3|For I will proclaim the name of Jehovah:                   Ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
Deuteronomy|32|4|The Rock, his work is perfect;                   For all his ways are justice:                   A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,                   Just and right is he.
Deuteronomy|32|5|They have dealt corruptly with him, {they are} not his children, {it is} their blemish;                           {They are} a perverse and crooked generation.
Deuteronomy|32|6|Do ye thus requite Jehovah,                   O foolish people and unwise?                   Is not he thy father that hath bought thee?                   He hath made thee, and established thee.
Deuteronomy|32|7|Remember the days of old,                   Consider the years of many generations:                   Ask thy father, and he will show thee;                   Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
Deuteronomy|32|8|When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,                   When he separated the children of men,                   He set the bounds of the peoples                   According to the number of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|32|9|For Jehovah’s portion is his people;                   Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
Deuteronomy|32|10|He found him in a desert land,                   And in the waste howling wilderness;                   He compassed him about, he cared for him,                   He kept him as the apple of his eye.
Deuteronomy|32|11|As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,                   That fluttereth over her young,                   He spread abroad his wings, he took them,                   He bare them on his pinions.
Deuteronomy|32|12|Jehovah alone did lead him,                   And there was no foreign god with him.
Deuteronomy|32|13|He made him ride on the high places of the earth,                   And he did eat the increase of the field;                   And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,                   And oil out of the flinty rock;
Deuteronomy|32|14|Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,                   With fat of lambs,                   And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,                   With the finest of the wheat;                   And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
Deuteronomy|32|15|But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:                   Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek;                   Then he forsook God who made him,                   And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
Deuteronomy|32|16|They moved him to jealousy with strange {gods};                   With abominations provoked they him to anger.
Deuteronomy|32|17|They sacrificed unto demons, {which were} no God,                   To gods that they knew not,                   To new {gods} that came up of late,                   Which your fathers dreaded not.
Deuteronomy|32|18|Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,                   And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth.
Deuteronomy|32|19|And Jehovah saw {it}, and abhorred {them},                   Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
Deuteronomy|32|20|And he said, I will hide my face from them,                   I will see what their end shall be:                   For they are a very perverse generation,                   Children in whom is no faithfulness.
Deuteronomy|32|21|They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;                   They have provoked me to anger with their vanities:                   And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people;                   I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy|32|22|For a fire is kindled in mine anger,                   And burneth unto the lowest Sheol,                   And devoureth the earth with its increase,                   And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy|32|23|I will heap evils upon them;                   I will spend mine arrows upon them:
Deuteronomy|32|24|{They shall be} wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat                   And bitter destruction;                   And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,                   With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
Deuteronomy|32|25|Without shall the sword bereave,                   And in the chambers terror;                           {It shall destroy} both young man and virgin,                   The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
Deuteronomy|32|26|I said, I would scatter them afar,                   I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
Deuteronomy|32|27|Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,                   Lest their adversaries should judge amiss,                   Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted,                   And Jehovah hath not done all this.
Deuteronomy|32|28|For they are a nation void of counsel,                   And there is no understanding in them.
Deuteronomy|32|29|Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,                   That they would consider their latter end!
Deuteronomy|32|30|How should one chase a thousand,                   And two put ten thousand to flight,                   Except their Rock had sold them,                   And Jehovah had delivered them up?
Deuteronomy|32|31|For their rock is not as our Rock,                   Even our enemies themselves being judges.
Deuteronomy|32|32|For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,                   And of the fields of Gomorrah:                   Their grapes are grapes of gall,                   Their clusters are bitter:
Deuteronomy|32|33|Their wine is the poison of serpents,                   And the cruel venom of asps.
Deuteronomy|32|34|Is not this laid up in store with me,                   Sealed up among my treasures?
Deuteronomy|32|35|Vengeance is mine, and recompense,                   At the time when their foot shall slide:                   For the day of their calamity is at hand,                   And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
Deuteronomy|32|36|For Jehovah will judge his people,                   And repent himself for his servants;                   When he seeth that {their} power is gone,                   And there is none {remaining}, shut up or left at large.
Deuteronomy|32|37|And he will say, Where are their gods,                   The rock in which they took refuge;
Deuteronomy|32|38|Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,                           {And} drank the wine of their drink-offering?                   Let them rise up and help you,                   Let them be your protection.
Deuteronomy|32|39|See now that I, even I, am he,                   And there is no god with me:                   I kill, and I make alive;                   I wound, and I heal;                   And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
Deuteronomy|32|40|For I lift up my hand to heaven,                   And say, As I live for ever,
Deuteronomy|32|41|If I whet my glittering sword,                   And my hand take hold on judgment;                   I will render vengeance to mine adversaries,                   And will recompense them that hate me.
Deuteronomy|32|42|I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,                   And my sword shall devour flesh;                   With the blood of the slain and the captives,                   From the head of the leaders of the enemy.
Deuteronomy|32|43|Rejoice, O ye nations, {with} his people:                   For he will avenge the blood of his servants,                    And will render vengeance to his adversaries,                   And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
Deuteronomy|32|44|And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
Deuteronomy|32|45|And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
Deuteronomy|32|46|And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, {even} all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy|32|47|For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
Deuteronomy|32|48|And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
Deuteronomy|32|49|Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;
Deuteronomy|32|50|and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
Deuteronomy|32|51|because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|32|52|For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|33|1|And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
Deuteronomy|33|2|And he said,             Jehovah came from Sinai,                   And rose from Seir unto them;                   He shined forth from mount Paran,                   And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones:                   At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
Deuteronomy|33|3|Yea, he loveth the people;                   All his saints are in thy hand:                   And they sat down at thy feet;                           {Every one} shall receive of thy words.
Deuteronomy|33|4|Moses commanded us a law,                   An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
Deuteronomy|33|5|And he was king in Jeshurun,                   When the heads of the people were gathered,                   All the tribes of Israel together.
Deuteronomy|33|6|Let Reuben live, and not die;                   Nor let his men be few.
Deuteronomy|33|7|And this is {the blessing} of Judah: and he said,             Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah,                   And bring him in unto his people.                   With his hands he contended for himself;                   And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.
Deuteronomy|33|8|And of Levi he said,             Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one,                   Whom thou didst prove at Massah,                   With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
Deuteronomy|33|9|Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;                   Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,                   Nor knew he his own children:                   For they have observed thy word,                   And keep thy covenant.
Deuteronomy|33|10|They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances,                   And Israel thy law:                   They shall put incense before thee,                   And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.
Deuteronomy|33|11|Bless, Jehovah, his substance,                   And accept the work of his hands:                   Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,                   And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
Deuteronomy|33|12|Of Benjamin he said,             The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by him;                   He covereth him all the day long,                   And he dwelleth between his shoulders.
Deuteronomy|33|13|And of Joseph he said,             Blessed of Jehovah be his land,                   For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,                   And for the deep that coucheth beneath,
Deuteronomy|33|14|And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,                   And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
Deuteronomy|33|15|And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,                   And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
Deuteronomy|33|16|And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,                   And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.                   Let {the blessing} come upon the head of Joseph,                   And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Deuteronomy|33|17|The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;                   And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox:                   With them he shall push the peoples all of them, {even} the ends of the earth:                   And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,                   And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
Deuteronomy|33|18|And of Zebulun he said,             Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;                   And, Issachar, in thy tents.
Deuteronomy|33|19|They shall call the peoples unto the mountain;                   There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness:                   For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,                   And the hidden treasures of the sand.
Deuteronomy|33|20|And of Gad he said,             Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:                   He dwelleth as a lioness,                   And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
Deuteronomy|33|21|And he provided the first part for himself,                   For there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved;                   And he came {with} the heads of the people;                   He executed the righteousness of Jehovah,                   And his ordinances with Israel.
Deuteronomy|33|22|And of Dan he said,             Dan is a lion’s whelp,                   That leapeth forth from Bashan.
Deuteronomy|33|23|And of Naphtali he said,             O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,                   And full with the blessing of Jehovah,                   Possess thou the west and the south.
Deuteronomy|33|24|And of Asher he said,             Blessed be Asher with children;                   Let him be acceptable unto his brethren,                   And let him dip his foot in oil.
Deuteronomy|33|25|Thy bars shall be iron and brass;                   And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
Deuteronomy|33|26|There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,                   Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help,                   And in his excellency on the skies.
Deuteronomy|33|27|The eternal God is {thy} dwelling-place,                   And underneath are the everlasting arms.                   And he thrust out the enemy from before thee,                   And said, Destroy.
Deuteronomy|33|28|And Israel dwelleth in safety,                   The fountain of Jacob alone,                   In a land of grain and new wine;                   Yea, his heavens drop down dew.
Deuteronomy|33|29|Happy art thou, O Israel:                   Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah,                   The shield of thy help,                   And the sword of thy excellency!                   And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee;                   And thou shalt tread upon their high places.
Deuteronomy|34|1|And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,
Deuteronomy|34|2|and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the hinder sea,
Deuteronomy|34|3|and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar.
Deuteronomy|34|4|And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
Deuteronomy|34|5|So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|34|6|And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
Deuteronomy|34|7|And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
Deuteronomy|34|8|And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.
Deuteronomy|34|9|And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Deuteronomy|34|10|And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
Deuteronomy|34|11|in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
Deuteronomy|34|12|and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
1 John|1|1|That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life
1 John|1|2|(and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal {life}, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us);
1 John|1|3|that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:
1 John|1|4|and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.
1 John|1|5|And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1 John|1|6|If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
1 John|1|7|but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1 John|1|8|If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
1 John|1|9|If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 John|1|10|If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1 John|2|1|My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
1 John|2|2|and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
1 John|2|3|And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1 John|2|4|He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
1 John|2|5|but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:
1 John|2|6|he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
1 John|2|7|Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.
1 John|2|8|Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.
1 John|2|9|He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
1 John|2|10|He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
1 John|2|11|But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1 John|2|12|I write unto you, {my} little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
1 John|2|13|I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.
1 John|2|14|I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.
1 John|2|15|Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
1 John|2|16|For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
1 John|2|17|And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
1 John|2|18|Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour.
1 John|2|19|They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but {they went out}, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.
1 John|2|20|And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all the things.
1 John|2|21|I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
1 John|2|22|Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, {even} he that denieth the Father and the Son.
1 John|2|23|Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.
1 John|2|24|As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.
1 John|2|25|And this is the promise which he promised us, {even} the life eternal.
1 John|2|26|These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.
1 John|2|27|And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you; concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.
1 John|2|28|And now, {my} little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
1 John|2|29|If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him.
1 John|3|1|Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and {such} we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
1 John|3|2|Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.
1 John|3|3|And every one that hath this hope {set} on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
1 John|3|4|Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
1 John|3|5|And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.
1 John|3|6|Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.
1 John|3|7|{My} little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:
1 John|3|8|he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
1 John|3|9|Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.
1 John|3|10|In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
1 John|3|11|For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:
1 John|3|12|not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
1 John|3|13|Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.
1 John|3|14|We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.
1 John|3|15|Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
1 John|3|16|Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
1 John|3|17|But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?
1 John|3|18|{My} Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.
1 John|3|19|Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:
1 John|3|20|because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
1 John|3|21|Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;
1 John|3|22|and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
1 John|3|23|And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.
1 John|3|24|And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
1 John|4|1|Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
1 John|4|2|Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
1 John|4|3|and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the {spirit} of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.
1 John|4|4|Ye are of God, {my} little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
1 John|4|5|They are of the world: therefore speak they {as} of the world, and the world heareth them.
1 John|4|6|We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1 John|4|7|Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.
1 John|4|8|He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
1 John|4|9|Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.
1 John|4|10|Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son {to be} the propitiation for our sins.
1 John|4|11|Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
1 John|4|12|No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:
1 John|4|13|hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
1 John|4|14|And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son {to be} the Saviour of the world.
1 John|4|15|Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.
1 John|4|16|And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.
1 John|4|17|Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.
1 John|4|18|There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.
1 John|4|19|We love, because he first loved us.
1 John|4|20|If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.
1 John|4|21|And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.
1 John|5|1|Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1 John|5|2|Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.
1 John|5|3|For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
1 John|5|4|For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, {even} our faith.
1 John|5|5|And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John|5|6|This is he that came by water and blood, {even} Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
1 John|5|7|And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
1 John|5|8|For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.
1 John|5|9|If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.
1 John|5|10|He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son.
1 John|5|11|And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
1 John|5|12|He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.
1 John|5|13|These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, {even} unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.
1 John|5|14|And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us:
1 John|5|15|and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
1 John|5|16|If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and {God} will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.
1 John|5|17|All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1 John|5|18|We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.
1 John|5|19|We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.
1 John|5|20|And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, {even} in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
1 John|5|21|{My} little children, guard yourselves from idols.
Philemon|1|1|Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
Philemon|1|2|and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
Philemon|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon|1|4|I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
Philemon|1|5|hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
Philemon|1|6|that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
Philemon|1|7|For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
Philemon|1|8|Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
Philemon|1|9|yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
Philemon|1|10|I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
Philemon|1|11|who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
Philemon|1|12|whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
Philemon|1|13|whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Philemon|1|14|but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
Philemon|1|15|For perhaps he was therefore parted {from thee} for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
Philemon|1|16|no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon|1|17|If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon|1|18|But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth {thee} aught, put that to mine account;
Philemon|1|19|I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
Philemon|1|20|Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon|1|21|Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
Philemon|1|22|But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
Philemon|1|23|Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
Philemon|1|24|{and so do} Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
Philemon|1|25|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
