1 Kings|15|26|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|15|27|And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1 Kings|15|28|Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|29|And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
1 Kings|15|30|for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin, because of his provocation wherewith he provoked Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger.
1 Kings|15|31|Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|15|32|And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings|15|33|In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, {and reigned} twenty and four years.
1 Kings|15|34|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|16|1|And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
1 Kings|16|2|Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1 Kings|16|3|behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings|16|4|Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
1 Kings|16|5|Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|6|And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|7|And moreover by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of Jehovah against Baasha, and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.
1 Kings|16|8|In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, {and reigned} two years.
1 Kings|16|9|And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
1 Kings|16|10|and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|11|And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
1 Kings|16|12|Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
1 Kings|16|13|for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|14|Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|15|In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1 Kings|16|16|And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1 Kings|16|17|And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|18|And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
1 Kings|16|19|for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
1 Kings|16|20|Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|21|Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1 Kings|16|22|But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1 Kings|16|23|In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, {and reigned} twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|24|And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
1 Kings|16|25|And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|26|For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|27|Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|28|So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|29|And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
1 Kings|16|30|And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|31|And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
1 Kings|16|32|And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1 Kings|16|33|And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
1 Kings|16|34|In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss of Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates thereof with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
1 Kings|17|1|And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
1 Kings|17|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|3|Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|4|And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1 Kings|17|5|So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|6|And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
1 Kings|17|7|And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
1 Kings|17|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|9|Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.
1 Kings|17|10|So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1 Kings|17|11|And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
1 Kings|17|12|And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
1 Kings|17|13|And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
1 Kings|17|14|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|17|15|And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days.
1 Kings|17|16|The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by Elijah.
1 Kings|17|17|And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
1 Kings|17|18|And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!
1 Kings|17|19|And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
1 Kings|17|20|And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
1 Kings|17|21|And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.
1 Kings|17|22|And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
1 Kings|17|23|And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
1 Kings|17|24|And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth.
1 Kings|18|1|And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|18|2|And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.
1 Kings|18|3|And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:
1 Kings|18|4|for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
1 Kings|18|5|And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
1 Kings|18|6|So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1 Kings|18|7|And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?
1 Kings|18|8|And he answered him, It is I: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
1 Kings|18|9|And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
1 Kings|18|10|As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
1 Kings|18|11|And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}.
1 Kings|18|12|And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.
1 Kings|18|13|Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
1 Kings|18|14|And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}; and he will slay me.
1 Kings|18|15|And Elijah said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him to-day.
1 Kings|18|16|So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings|18|17|And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?
1 Kings|18|18|And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.
1 Kings|18|19|Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, that eat at Jezebel’s table.
1 Kings|18|20|So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
1 Kings|18|21|And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
1 Kings|18|22|Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
1 Kings|18|23|Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|24|And call ye on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Jehovah; and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
1 Kings|18|25|And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|26|And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.
1 Kings|18|27|And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.
1 Kings|18|28|And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.
1 Kings|18|29|And it was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the {evening} oblation; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
1 Kings|18|30|And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.
1 Kings|18|31|And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
1 Kings|18|32|And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
1 Kings|18|33|And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.
