Joshua|8|12|And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
Joshua|8|13|So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
Joshua|8|14|And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua|8|15|And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua|8|16|And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua|8|17|And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
Joshua|8|18|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
Joshua|8|19|And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.
Joshua|8|20|And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
Joshua|8|21|And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|22|And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
Joshua|8|23|And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua|8|24|And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua|8|25|And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|26|For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua|8|27|Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
Joshua|8|28|So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.
Joshua|8|29|And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide: and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.
Joshua|8|30|Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
Joshua|8|31|as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
Joshua|8|32|And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua|8|33|And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
Joshua|8|34|And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
Joshua|8|35|There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners that were among them.
Joshua|9|1|And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
Joshua|9|2|that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
Joshua|9|3|But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
Joshua|9|4|they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,
Joshua|9|5|and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.
Joshua|9|6|And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|7|And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?
Joshua|9|8|And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
Joshua|9|9|And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
Joshua|9|10|and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Joshua|9|11|And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|12|This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:
Joshua|9|13|and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
Joshua|9|14|And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.
Joshua|9|15|And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.
Joshua|9|16|And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
Joshua|9|17|And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua|9|18|And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
Joshua|9|19|But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
Joshua|9|20|This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
Joshua|9|21|And the princes said unto them, Let them live: so they became hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had spoken unto them.
Joshua|9|22|And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
Joshua|9|23|Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
Joshua|9|24|And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
Joshua|9|25|And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
Joshua|9|26|And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
Joshua|9|27|And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Jehovah, unto this day, in the place which he should choose.
Joshua|10|1|Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
Joshua|10|2|that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
Joshua|10|3|Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Joshua|10|4|Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
Joshua|10|5|Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
Joshua|10|6|And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.
Joshua|10|7|So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
Joshua|10|8|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
Joshua|10|9|Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; {for} he went up from Gilgal all the night.
Joshua|10|10|And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
Joshua|10|11|And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
Joshua|10|12|Then spake Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel,             Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;                   And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
Joshua|10|13|And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed,                   Until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies.            Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
Joshua|10|14|And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.
Joshua|10|15|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua|10|16|And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|17|And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|18|And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:
Joshua|10|19|but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.
Joshua|10|20|And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
Joshua|10|21|that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
Joshua|10|22|Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.
Joshua|10|23|And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
Joshua|10|24|And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
Joshua|10|25|And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
Joshua|10|26|And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
Joshua|10|27|And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, unto this very day.
Joshua|10|28|And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof: he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua|10|29|And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
Joshua|10|30|and Jehovah delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining in it; and he did unto the king thereof as he had done unto the king of Jericho.
Joshua|10|31|And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|32|and Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
Joshua|10|33|Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
Joshua|10|34|And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
Joshua|10|35|and they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
Joshua|10|36|And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
Joshua|10|37|and they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
Joshua|10|38|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|39|and he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king thereof.
Joshua|10|40|So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.
Joshua|10|41|And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
Joshua|10|42|And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
Joshua|10|43|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
Joshua|11|1|And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua|11|2|and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
Joshua|11|3|to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua|11|4|And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
Joshua|11|5|And all these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
Joshua|11|6|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
