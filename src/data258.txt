Leviticus|9|16|And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus|9|17|And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
Leviticus|9|18|He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
Leviticus|9|19|and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth {the inwards}, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:
Leviticus|9|20|and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Leviticus|9|21|and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.
Leviticus|9|22|And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|9|23|And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.
Leviticus|9|24|And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
Leviticus|10|1|And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus|10|2|And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
Leviticus|10|3|Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus|10|4|And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus|10|5|So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus|10|6|And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.
Leviticus|10|7|And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus|10|8|And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|10|9|Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
Leviticus|10|10|and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus|10|11|and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.
Leviticus|10|12|And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;
Leviticus|10|13|and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus|10|14|And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
Leviticus|10|15|The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.
Leviticus|10|16|And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
Leviticus|10|17|Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|18|Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Leviticus|10|19|And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|20|And when Moses heard {that}, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
Leviticus|11|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus|11|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus|11|3|Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, {and} cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|4|Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|5|And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|6|And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|7|And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|8|Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|9|These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|10|And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
Leviticus|11|11|and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
Leviticus|11|12|Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|13|And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Leviticus|11|14|and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,
Leviticus|11|15|every raven after its kind,
Leviticus|11|16|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,
Leviticus|11|17|and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
Leviticus|11|18|and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,
Leviticus|11|19|and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus|11|20|All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|21|Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|22|Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
Leviticus|11|23|But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|24|And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;
Leviticus|11|25|And whosoever beareth {aught} of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|26|Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|27|And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|28|And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|29|And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,
Leviticus|11|30|and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus|11|31|These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|32|And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.
Leviticus|11|33|And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.
Leviticus|11|34|All food {therein} which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every {such} vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|35|And every thing whereupon {any part} of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|36|Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|37|And if {aught} of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus|11|38|But if water be put upon the seed, and {aught} of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|39|And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|40|And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|41|And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|11|42|Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
Leviticus|11|43|Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
Leviticus|11|44|For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|45|For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
Leviticus|11|46|This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
Leviticus|11|47|to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.
Leviticus|12|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|12|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.
Leviticus|12|3|And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus|12|4|And she shall continue in the blood of {her} purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
Leviticus|12|5|But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of {her} purifying threescore and six days.
Leviticus|12|6|And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:
Leviticus|12|7|and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus|12|8|And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
Leviticus|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|13|2|When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
Leviticus|13|3|and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus|13|4|And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|5|and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|6|and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|7|But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:
Leviticus|13|8|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus|13|9|When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
Leviticus|13|10|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,
Leviticus|13|11|it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|12|And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of {him that hath} the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;
Leviticus|13|13|then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
Leviticus|13|14|But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus|13|15|And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus|13|16|Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;
