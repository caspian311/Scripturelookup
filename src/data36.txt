2 Samuel|4|8|And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
2 Samuel|4|9|And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
2 Samuel|4|10|when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.
2 Samuel|4|11|How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
2 Samuel|4|12|And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
2 Samuel|5|1|Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2 Samuel|5|2|In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|3|So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|4|David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
2 Samuel|5|5|In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel|5|6|And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.
2 Samuel|5|7|Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
2 Samuel|5|8|And David said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and {smite} the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.
2 Samuel|5|9|And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
2 Samuel|5|10|And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him.
2 Samuel|5|11|And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
2 Samuel|5|12|And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.
2 Samuel|5|13|And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
2 Samuel|5|14|And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
2 Samuel|5|15|and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
2 Samuel|5|16|and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2 Samuel|5|17|And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
2 Samuel|5|18|Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|19|And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
2 Samuel|5|20|And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
2 Samuel|5|21|And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.
2 Samuel|5|22|And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|23|And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
2 Samuel|5|24|And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|5|25|And David did so, as Jehovah commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
2 Samuel|6|1|And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2 Samuel|6|2|And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Jehovah of hosts that sitteth {above} the cherubim.
2 Samuel|6|3|And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
2 Samuel|6|4|And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
2 Samuel|6|5|And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah with all manner of {instruments made of} fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
2 Samuel|6|6|And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth {his hand} to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.
2 Samuel|6|7|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
2 Samuel|6|8|And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.
2 Samuel|6|9|And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?
2 Samuel|6|10|So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel|6|11|And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
2 Samuel|6|12|And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
2 Samuel|6|13|And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
2 Samuel|6|14|And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
2 Samuel|6|15|So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel|6|16|And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
2 Samuel|6|17|And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|18|And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
2 Samuel|6|19|And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion {of flesh}, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.
2 Samuel|6|20|Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
2 Samuel|6|21|And David said unto Michal, {It was} before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|22|And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.
2 Samuel|6|23|And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
2 Samuel|7|1|And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
2 Samuel|7|2|that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
2 Samuel|7|3|And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.
2 Samuel|7|4|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,
2 Samuel|7|5|Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
2 Samuel|7|6|for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
2 Samuel|7|7|In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
2 Samuel|7|8|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;
2 Samuel|7|9|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
2 Samuel|7|10|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,
2 Samuel|7|11|and {as} from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.
2 Samuel|7|12|When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel|7|13|He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
2 Samuel|7|14|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;
2 Samuel|7|15|but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
2 Samuel|7|16|And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
2 Samuel|7|17|According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2 Samuel|7|18|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
2 Samuel|7|19|And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this {too} after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!
2 Samuel|7|20|And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.
2 Samuel|7|21|For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.
2 Samuel|7|22|Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
2 Samuel|7|23|And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, {from} the nations and their gods?
2 Samuel|7|24|And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
2 Samuel|7|25|And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
2 Samuel|7|26|And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.
2 Samuel|7|27|For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
2 Samuel|7|28|And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
2 Samuel|7|29|now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
2 Samuel|8|1|And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|8|2|And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
2 Samuel|8|3|David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
2 Samuel|8|4|And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
2 Samuel|8|5|And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|6|Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
2 Samuel|8|7|And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|8|8|And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2 Samuel|8|9|And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
2 Samuel|8|10|then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And {Joram} brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
2 Samuel|8|11|These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
2 Samuel|8|12|of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2 Samuel|8|13|And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|14|And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
2 Samuel|8|15|And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
2 Samuel|8|16|And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel|8|17|and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
2 Samuel|8|18|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was over} the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
