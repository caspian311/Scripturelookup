Job|20|17|He shall not look upon the rivers,                   The flowing streams of honey and butter.
Job|20|18|That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down;                   According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
Job|20|19|For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;                   He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
Job|20|20|Because he knew no quietness within him,                   He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.
Job|20|21|There was nothing left that he devoured not;                   Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
Job|20|22|In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:                   The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
Job|20|23|When he is about to fill his belly, {God} will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him,                   And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
Job|20|24|He shall flee from the iron weapon,                   And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
Job|20|25|He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body;                   Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall:                   Terrors are upon him.
Job|20|26|All darkness is laid up for his treasures:                   A fire not blown {by man} shall devour him;                   It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job|20|27|The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,                   And the earth shall rise up against him.
Job|20|28|The increase of his house shall depart;                           {His goods} shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
Job|20|29|This is the portion of a wicked man from God,                   And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
Job|21|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|21|2|Hear diligently my speech;                   And let this be your consolations.
Job|21|3|Suffer me, and I also will speak;                   And after that I have spoken, mock on.
Job|21|4|As for me, is my complaint to man?                   And why should I not be impatient?
Job|21|5|Mark me, and be astonished,                    And lay your hand upon your mouth.
Job|21|6|Even when I remember I am troubled,                   And horror taketh hold on my flesh.
Job|21|7|Wherefore do the wicked live,                   Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
Job|21|8|Their seed is established with them in their sight,                   And their offspring before their eyes.
Job|21|9|Their houses are safe from fear,                   Neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job|21|10|Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;                   Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
Job|21|11|They send forth their little ones like a flock,                   And their children dance.
Job|21|12|They sing to the timbrel and harp,                   And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
Job|21|13|They spend their days in prosperity,                   And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
Job|21|14|And they say unto God, Depart from us;                   For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
Job|21|15|What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?                   And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
Job|21|16|Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:                   The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|21|17|How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?                   That their calamity cometh upon them?                   That {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger?
Job|21|18|That they are as stubble before the wind,                   And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
Job|21|19|{Ye say}, God layeth up his iniquity for his children.                   Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:
Job|21|20|Let his own eyes see his destruction,                   And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job|21|21|For what careth he for his house after him,                   When the number of his months is cut off?
Job|21|22|Shall any teach God knowledge,                   Seeing he judgeth those that are high?
Job|21|23|One dieth in his full strength,                   Being wholly at ease and quiet:
Job|21|24|His pails are full of milk,                   And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job|21|25|And another dieth in bitterness of soul,                   And never tasteth of good.
Job|21|26|They lie down alike in the dust,                   And the worm covereth them.
Job|21|27|Behold, I know your thoughts,                   And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.
Job|21|28|For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?                   And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
Job|21|29|Have ye not asked wayfaring men?                   And do ye not know their evidences,
Job|21|30|That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?                   That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
Job|21|31|Who shall declare his way to his face?                   And who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job|21|32|Yet shall he be borne to the grave,                   And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
Job|21|33|The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,                   And all men shall draw after him,                   As there were innumerable before him.
Job|21|34|How then comfort ye me in vain,                   Seeing in your answers there remaineth {only} falsehood?
Job|22|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|22|2|Can a man be profitable unto God?                   Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
Job|22|3|Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?                   Or is it gain {to him}, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
Job|22|4|Is it for thy fear {of him} that he reproveth thee,                   That he entereth with thee into judgment?
Job|22|5|Is not thy wickedness great?                   Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
Job|22|6|For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,                   And stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job|22|7|Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,                   And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
Job|22|8|But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;                   And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.
Job|22|9|Thou hast sent widows away empty,                   And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job|22|10|Therefore snares are round about thee,                   And sudden fear troubleth thee,
Job|22|11|Or darkness, so that thou canst not see,                   And abundance of waters cover thee.
Job|22|12|Is not God in the height of heaven?                   And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
Job|22|13|And thou sayest, What doth God know?                   Can he judge through the thick darkness?
Job|22|14|Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not;                   And he walketh on the vault of heaven.
Job|22|15|Wilt thou keep the old way                   Which wicked men have trodden?
Job|22|16|Who were snatched away before their time,                   Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
Job|22|17|Who said unto God, Depart from us;                   And, What can the Almighty do for us?
Job|22|18|Yet he filled their houses with good things:                   But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|22|19|The righteous see it, and are glad;                   And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
Job|22|20|{Saying}, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off,                   And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.
Job|22|21|Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:                   Thereby good shall come unto thee.
Job|22|22|Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,                   And lay up his words in thy heart.
Job|22|23|If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,                   If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.
Job|22|24|And lay thou {thy} treasure in the dust,                   And {the gold of} Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
Job|22|25|And the Almighty will be thy treasure,                   And precious silver unto thee.
Job|22|26|For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty,                   And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
Job|22|27|Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee;                   And thou shalt pay thy vows.
Job|22|28|Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee;                   And light shall shine upon thy ways.
Job|22|29|When they cast {thee} down, thou shalt say, {There is} lifting up;                   And the humble person he will save.
Job|22|30|He will deliver {even} him that is not innocent:                   Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
Job|23|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|23|2|Even to-day is my complaint rebellious:                   My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job|23|3|Oh that I knew where I might find him!                   That I might come even to his seat!
Job|23|4|I would set my cause in order before him,                   And fill my mouth with arguments.
Job|23|5|I would know the words which he would answer me,                   And understand what he would say unto me.
Job|23|6|Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?                   Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
Job|23|7|There the upright might reason with him;                   So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job|23|8|Behold, I go forward, but he is not {there};                   And backward, but I cannot perceive him;
Job|23|9|On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him;                   He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
Job|23|10|But he knoweth the way that I take;                   When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job|23|11|My foot hath held fast to his steps;                   His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
Job|23|12|I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips;                   I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job|23|13|But he is in one {mind}, and who can turn him?                   And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
Job|23|14|For he performeth that which is appointed for me:                   And many such things are with him.
Job|23|15|Therefore am I terrified at his presence;                   When I consider, I am afraid of him.
Job|23|16|For God hath made my heart faint,                   And the Almighty hath terrified me;
Job|23|17|Because I was not cut off before the darkness,                   Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
Job|24|1|Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?                   And why do not they that know him see his days?
Job|24|2|There are that remove the landmarks;                   They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
Job|24|3|They drive away the ass of the fatherless;                   They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
Job|24|4|They turn the needy out of the way:                   The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
Job|24|5|Behold, as wild asses in the desert                   They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;                   The wilderness {yieldeth} them bread for their children.
Job|24|6|They cut their provender in the field;                   And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
