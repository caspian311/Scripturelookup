John|7|33|Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.
John|7|34|Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
John|7|35|The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
John|7|36|What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
John|7|37|Now on the last day, the great {day} of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
John|7|38|He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
John|7|39|But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet {given}; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
John|7|40|{Some} of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
John|7|41|Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
John|7|42|Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
John|7|43|So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
John|7|44|And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
John|7|45|The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?
John|7|46|The officers answered, Never a man so spake.
John|7|47|The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?
John|7|48|Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?
John|7|49|But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.
John|7|50|Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),
John|7|51|Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?
John|7|52|They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
John|7|53|And they went every man unto his own house:
John|8|1|but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
John|8|2|And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
John|8|3|And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
John|8|4|they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.
John|8|5|Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?
John|8|6|And this they said, trying him, that they might have {whereof} to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|7|But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
John|8|8|And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|9|And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, {even} unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
John|8|10|And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
John|8|11|And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.
John|8|12|Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John|8|13|The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
John|8|14|Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
John|8|15|Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
John|8|16|Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
John|8|17|Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
John|8|18|I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
John|8|19|They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
John|8|20|These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
John|8|21|He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.
John|8|22|The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?
John|8|23|And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
John|8|24|I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am {he}, ye shall die in your sins.
John|8|25|They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
John|8|26|I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
John|8|27|They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.
John|8|28|Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am {he}, and {that} I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
John|8|29|And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
John|8|30|As he spake these things, many believed on him.
John|8|31|Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, {then} are ye truly my disciples;
John|8|32|and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
John|8|33|They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
John|8|34|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
John|8|35|And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
John|8|36|If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
John|8|37|I know that ye are Abraham’s seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
John|8|38|I speak the things which I have seen with {my} Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from {your} father.
John|8|39|They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
John|8|40|But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
John|8|41|Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, {even} God.
John|8|42|Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
John|8|43|Why do ye not understand my speech? {Even} because ye cannot hear my word.
John|8|44|Ye are of {your} father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
John|8|45|But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
John|8|46|Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?
John|8|47|He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear {them} not, because ye are not of God.
John|8|48|The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
John|8|49|Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
John|8|50|But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
John|8|51|Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
John|8|52|The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
John|8|53|Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
John|8|54|Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;
John|8|55|and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.
John|8|56|Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
John|8|57|The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
John|8|58|Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
John|8|59|They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
John|9|1|And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.
John|9|2|And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
John|9|3|Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
John|9|4|We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
John|9|5|When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John|9|6|When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,
John|9|7|and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
John|9|8|The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
John|9|9|Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am {he}.
John|9|10|They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?
John|9|11|He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.
John|9|12|And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.
John|9|13|They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
John|9|14|Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John|9|15|Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
John|9|16|Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.
John|9|17|They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
John|9|18|The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
John|9|19|and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
John|9|20|His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
