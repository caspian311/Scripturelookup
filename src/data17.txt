Ezekiel|19|4|The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|19|5|Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
Ezekiel|19|6|And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
Ezekiel|19|7|And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.
Ezekiel|19|8|Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
Ezekiel|19|9|And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel|19|10|Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
Ezekiel|19|11|And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.
Ezekiel|19|12|But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.
Ezekiel|19|13|And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
Ezekiel|19|14|And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
Ezekiel|20|1|And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth {month}, the tenth {day} of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|20|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|3|Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel|20|4|Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
Ezekiel|20|5|and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;
Ezekiel|20|6|in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
Ezekiel|20|7|And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|8|But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|9|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|10|So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|11|And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.
Ezekiel|20|12|Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.
Ezekiel|20|13|But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
Ezekiel|20|14|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
Ezekiel|20|15|Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
Ezekiel|20|16|because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
Ezekiel|20|17|Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|18|And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel|20|19|I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
Ezekiel|20|20|and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|21|But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|22|Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
Ezekiel|20|23|Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
Ezekiel|20|24|because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
Ezekiel|20|25|Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live;
Ezekiel|20|26|and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through {the fire} all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|27|Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
Ezekiel|20|28|For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.
Ezekiel|20|29|Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
Ezekiel|20|30|Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations?
Ezekiel|20|31|and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you;
Ezekiel|20|32|and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
Ezekiel|20|33|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you:
Ezekiel|20|34|and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;
Ezekiel|20|35|and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.
Ezekiel|20|36|Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|37|And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
Ezekiel|20|38|and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|39|As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.
Ezekiel|20|40|For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
Ezekiel|20|41|As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|20|42|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers.
Ezekiel|20|43|And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
Ezekiel|20|44|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|45|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|46|Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop {thy word} toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;
Ezekiel|20|47|and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt thereby.
Ezekiel|20|48|And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Ezekiel|20|49|Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?
Ezekiel|21|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|2|Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop {thy word} toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|21|3|and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel|21|4|Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
Ezekiel|21|5|and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
Ezekiel|21|6|Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.
Ezekiel|21|7|And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|9|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;
Ezekiel|21|10|it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.
Ezekiel|21|11|And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel|21|12|Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.
Ezekiel|21|13|For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|14|Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.
Ezekiel|21|15|I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
Ezekiel|21|16|Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
Ezekiel|21|17|I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|21|18|The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Ezekiel|21|19|Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
Ezekiel|21|20|Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
Ezekiel|21|21|For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.
Ezekiel|21|22|In his right hand was the divination {for} Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
Ezekiel|21|23|And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
Ezekiel|21|24|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
Ezekiel|21|25|And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
Ezekiel|21|26|thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this {shall be} no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
Ezekiel|21|27|I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it {him}.
Ezekiel|21|28|And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;
Ezekiel|21|29|while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
Ezekiel|21|30|Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.
Ezekiel|21|31|And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.
Ezekiel|21|32|Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|22|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|2|And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations.
Ezekiel|22|3|And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that maketh idols against herself to defile her!
Ezekiel|22|4|Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.
Ezekiel|22|5|Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one {and} full of tumult.
Ezekiel|22|6|Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.
Ezekiel|22|7|In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel|22|8|Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
