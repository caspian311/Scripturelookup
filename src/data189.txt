Daniel|9|9|To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;
Daniel|9|10|neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
Daniel|9|11|Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.
Daniel|9|12|And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
Daniel|9|13|As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.
Daniel|9|14|Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.
Daniel|9|15|And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
Daniel|9|16|O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.
Daniel|9|17|Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
Daniel|9|18|O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies’ sake.
Daniel|9|19|O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
Daniel|9|20|And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Daniel|9|21|yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
Daniel|9|22|And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.
Daniel|9|23|At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.
Daniel|9|24|Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.
Daniel|9|25|Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.
Daniel|9|26|And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.
Daniel|9|27|And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease; and upon the wing of abominations {shall come} one that maketh desolate; and even unto the full end, and that determined, shall {wrath} be poured out upon the desolate.
Daniel|10|1|In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
Daniel|10|2|In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.
Daniel|10|3|I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
Daniel|10|4|And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,
Daniel|10|5|I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:
Daniel|10|6|his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
Daniel|10|7|And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
Daniel|10|8|So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
Daniel|10|9|Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.
Daniel|10|10|And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
Daniel|10|11|And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
Daniel|10|12|Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words’ sake.
Daniel|10|13|But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Daniel|10|14|Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for {many} days:
Daniel|10|15|and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.
Daniel|10|16|And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
Daniel|10|17|For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.
Daniel|10|18|Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.
Daniel|10|19|And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
Daniel|10|20|Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.
Daniel|10|21|But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.
Daniel|11|1|And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
Daniel|11|2|And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
Daniel|11|3|And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
Daniel|11|4|And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.
Daniel|11|5|And the king of the south shall be strong, and {one} of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
Daniel|11|6|And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.
Daniel|11|7|But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.
Daniel|11|8|And also their gods, with their molten images, {and} with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.
Daniel|11|9|And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.
Daniel|11|10|And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.
Daniel|11|11|And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.
Daniel|11|12|And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
Daniel|11|13|And the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, {even of} years, with a great army and with much substance.
Daniel|11|14|And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
Daniel|11|15|So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.
Daniel|11|16|But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.
Daniel|11|17|And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.
Daniel|11|18|After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.
Daniel|11|19|Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
Daniel|11|20|Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
Daniel|11|21|And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
Daniel|11|22|And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
Daniel|11|23|And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.
Daniel|11|24|In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
Daniel|11|25|And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.
Daniel|11|26|Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.
Daniel|11|27|And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
Daniel|11|28|Then shall he return into his land with great substance; and his heart {shall be} against the holy covenant; and he shall do {his pleasure}, and return to his own land.
Daniel|11|29|At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.
Daniel|11|30|For ships of Kittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do {his pleasure}: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel|11|31|And forces shall stand on his part, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall take away the continual {burnt-offering}, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.
Daniel|11|32|And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the people that know their God shall be strong, and do {exploits}.
Daniel|11|33|And they that are wise among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, {many} days.
Daniel|11|34|Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.
Daniel|11|35|And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
Daniel|11|36|And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.
Daniel|11|37|Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.
Daniel|11|38|But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
Daniel|11|39|And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god: whosoever acknowledgeth {him} he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.
Daniel|11|40|And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.
Daniel|11|41|He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many {countries} shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
Daniel|11|42|He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
Daniel|11|43|But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
Daniel|11|44|But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.
Daniel|11|45|And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
Daniel|12|1|And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
Daniel|12|2|And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
Daniel|12|3|And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
Daniel|12|4|But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
Daniel|12|5|Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.
Daniel|12|6|And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
Daniel|12|7|And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
Daniel|12|8|And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?
Daniel|12|9|And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.
Daniel|12|10|Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand.
Daniel|12|11|And from the time that the continual {burnt-offering} shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.
Daniel|12|12|Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
Daniel|12|13|But go thou thy way till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and shalt stand in thy lot, at the end of the days.
Esther|1|1|Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),
Esther|1|2|that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
