Leviticus|13|17|and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: he is clean.
Leviticus|13|18|And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,
Leviticus|13|19|and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;
Leviticus|13|20|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.
Leviticus|13|21|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|22|And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
Leviticus|13|23|But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus|13|24|Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick {flesh} of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;
Leviticus|13|25|then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|26|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|27|and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|28|And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.
Leviticus|13|29|And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,
Leviticus|13|30|then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus|13|31|And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague of the scall seven days:
Leviticus|13|32|And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,
Leviticus|13|33|then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the scall seven days more:
Leviticus|13|34|and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|35|But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,
Leviticus|13|36|then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|37|But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus|13|38|And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
Leviticus|13|39|then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.
Leviticus|13|40|And if a man’s hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; {yet} is he clean.
Leviticus|13|41|And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; {yet} is he clean.
Leviticus|13|42|But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
Leviticus|13|43|Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;
Leviticus|13|44|he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.
Leviticus|13|45|And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
Leviticus|13|46|All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.
Leviticus|13|47|The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
Leviticus|13|48|whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;
Leviticus|13|49|if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.
Leviticus|13|50|And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up {that which hath} the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|51|and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus|13|52|And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
Leviticus|13|53|And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;
Leviticus|13|54|then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|55|and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
Leviticus|13|56|And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
Leviticus|13|57|and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
Leviticus|13|58|And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
Leviticus|13|59|This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
Leviticus|14|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|14|2|This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus|14|3|and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,
Leviticus|14|4|then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|5|And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
Leviticus|14|6|As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
Leviticus|14|7|And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.
Leviticus|14|8|And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.
Leviticus|14|9|And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|10|And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
Leviticus|14|11|And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|14|12|And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|13|and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:
Leviticus|14|14|and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|15|And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|16|and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|17|and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|18|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|19|And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;
Leviticus|14|20|and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|21|And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;
Leviticus|14|22|and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|14|23|And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|24|and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|25|And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|26|And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|27|and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|28|and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|29|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|30|And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,
Leviticus|14|31|even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|32|This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get {that which pertaineth} to his cleansing.
Leviticus|14|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|14|34|When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
Leviticus|14|35|then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.
Leviticus|14|36|And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
Leviticus|14|37|and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;
Leviticus|14|38|then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
Leviticus|14|39|And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
Leviticus|14|40|then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:
Leviticus|14|41|and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:
Leviticus|14|42|and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
Leviticus|14|43|And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
Leviticus|14|44|then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
Leviticus|14|45|And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
Leviticus|14|46|Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|14|47|And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus|14|48|And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
Leviticus|14|49|And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|50|and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus|14|51|and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
Leviticus|14|52|and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
Leviticus|14|53|but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|54|This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,
Leviticus|14|55|and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
Leviticus|14|56|and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
Leviticus|14|57|to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
