2 Samuel|1|6|And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
2 Samuel|1|7|And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
2 Samuel|1|8|And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
2 Samuel|1|9|And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
2 Samuel|1|10|So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
2 Samuel|1|11|Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
2 Samuel|1|12|and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
2 Samuel|1|13|And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
2 Samuel|1|14|And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah’s anointed?
2 Samuel|1|15|And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.
2 Samuel|1|16|And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah’s anointed.
2 Samuel|1|17|And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son
2 Samuel|1|18|(and he bade them teach the children of Judah {the song of} the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
2 Samuel|1|19|Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!                   How are the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel|1|20|Tell it not in Gath,                   Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon;                   Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,                   Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2 Samuel|1|21|Ye mountains of Gilboa,                   Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:                   For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,                   The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
2 Samuel|1|22|From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,                   The bow of Jonathan turned not back,                   And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
2 Samuel|1|23|Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,                   And in their death they were not divided:                   They were swifter than eagles,                   They were stronger than lions.
2 Samuel|1|24|Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,                   Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,                   Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2 Samuel|1|25|How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!                   Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
2 Samuel|1|26|I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:                   Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:                   Thy love to me was wonderful,                   Passing the love of women.
2 Samuel|1|27|How are the mighty fallen,                   And the weapons of war perished!
2 Samuel|2|1|And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|2|So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
2 Samuel|2|3|And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|4|And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.      And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.
2 Samuel|2|5|And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
2 Samuel|2|6|And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
2 Samuel|2|7|Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2 Samuel|2|8|Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
2 Samuel|2|9|and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
2 Samuel|2|10|Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel|2|11|And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel|2|12|And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|13|And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2 Samuel|2|14|And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
2 Samuel|2|15|Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2 Samuel|2|16|And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and {thrust} his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|17|And the battle was very sore that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
2 Samuel|2|18|And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2 Samuel|2|19|And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel|2|20|Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.
2 Samuel|2|21|And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
2 Samuel|2|22|And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
2 Samuel|2|23|Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
2 Samuel|2|24|But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|25|And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
2 Samuel|2|26|Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
2 Samuel|2|27|And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.
2 Samuel|2|28|So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2 Samuel|2|29|And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
2 Samuel|2|30|And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.
2 Samuel|2|31|But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, {so that} three hundred and threescore men died.
2 Samuel|2|32|And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day brake upon them at Hebron.
2 Samuel|3|1|Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
2 Samuel|3|2|And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2 Samuel|3|3|and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2 Samuel|3|4|and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2 Samuel|3|5|and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2 Samuel|3|6|And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
2 Samuel|3|7|Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and {Ish-bosheth} said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?
2 Samuel|3|8|Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.
2 Samuel|3|9|God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;
2 Samuel|3|10|to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|3|11|And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
2 Samuel|3|12|And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying {also}, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
2 Samuel|3|13|And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
2 Samuel|3|14|And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|3|15|And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.
2 Samuel|3|16|And her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return: and he returned.
2 Samuel|3|17|And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:
2 Samuel|3|18|now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
2 Samuel|3|19|And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel|3|20|So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
2 Samuel|3|21|And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
2 Samuel|3|22|And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|23|When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|24|Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
2 Samuel|3|25|Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
2 Samuel|3|26|And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
2 Samuel|3|27|And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
2 Samuel|3|28|And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
2 Samuel|3|29|let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.
2 Samuel|3|30|So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2 Samuel|3|31|And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
2 Samuel|3|32|And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
2 Samuel|3|33|And the king lamented for Abner, and said,             Should Abner die as a fool dieth?
2 Samuel|3|34|Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:                   As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so didst thou fall.            And all the people wept again over him.
2 Samuel|3|35|And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.
2 Samuel|3|36|And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
2 Samuel|3|37|So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
2 Samuel|3|38|And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
2 Samuel|3|39|And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: Jehovah reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.
2 Samuel|4|1|And when {Ish-bosheth}, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
2 Samuel|4|2|And {Ish-bosheth}, Saul’s son, {had} two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
2 Samuel|4|3|and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day).
2 Samuel|4|4|Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel|4|5|And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
2 Samuel|4|6|And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2 Samuel|4|7|Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
