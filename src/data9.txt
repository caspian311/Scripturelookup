Micah|4|11|And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see {our desire} upon Zion.
Micah|4|12|But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.
Micah|4|13|Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto Jehovah, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
Micah|5|1|Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
Micah|5|2|But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
Micah|5|3|Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
Micah|5|4|And he shall stand, and shall feed {his flock} in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
Micah|5|5|And this {man} shall be {our} peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
Micah|5|6|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.
Micah|5|7|And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
Micah|5|8|And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
Micah|5|9|Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.
Micah|5|10|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots:
Micah|5|11|and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.
Micah|5|12|And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no {more} soothsayers:
Micah|5|13|and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands;
Micah|5|14|and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.
Micah|5|15|And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.
Micah|6|1|Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
Micah|6|2|Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
Micah|6|3|O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
Micah|6|4|For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
Micah|6|5|O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; {remember} from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.
Micah|6|6|Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?
Micah|6|7|will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, {or} with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah|6|8|He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?
Micah|6|9|The voice of Jehovah crieth unto the city, and {the man of} wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
Micah|6|10|Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?
Micah|6|11|Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?
Micah|6|12|For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Micah|6|13|Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.
Micah|6|14|Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.
Micah|6|15|Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.
Micah|6|16|For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
Micah|7|1|Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.
Micah|7|2|The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
Micah|7|3|Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge {is ready} for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.
Micah|7|4|The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is {worse} than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.
Micah|7|5|Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
Micah|7|6|For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
Micah|7|7|But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
Micah|7|8|Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.
Micah|7|9|I will bear the indignation of Jehovah, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, {and} I shall behold his righteousness.
Micah|7|10|Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall see {my desire} upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
Micah|7|11|A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.
Micah|7|12|In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and {from} mountain to mountain.
Micah|7|13|Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
Micah|7|14|Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
Micah|7|15|As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.
Micah|7|16|The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
Micah|7|17|They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.
Micah|7|18|Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.
Micah|7|19|He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah|7|20|Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, {and} the lovingkindness to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
Joel|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Joel|1|2|Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
Joel|1|3|Tell ye your children of it, and {let} your children {tell} their children, and their children another generation.
Joel|1|4|That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
Joel|1|5|Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
Joel|1|6|For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
Joel|1|7|He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
Joel|1|8|Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
Joel|1|9|The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn.
Joel|1|10|The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
Joel|1|11|Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.
Joel|1|12|The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.
Joel|1|13|Gird yourselves {with sackcloth}, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.
Joel|1|14|Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men {and} all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.
Joel|1|15|Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
Joel|1|16|Is not the food cut off before our eyes, {yea}, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
Joel|1|17|The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.
Joel|1|18|How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
Joel|1|19|O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
Joel|1|20|Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
Joel|2|1|Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;
Joel|2|2|a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.
Joel|2|3|A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.
Joel|2|4|The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.
Joel|2|5|Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
Joel|2|6|At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.
Joel|2|7|They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.
Joel|2|8|Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off {their course}.
Joel|2|9|They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.
Joel|2|10|The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|2|11|And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
Joel|2|12|Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
Joel|2|13|and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
Joel|2|14|Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?
Joel|2|15|Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;
Joel|2|16|gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
Joel|2|17|Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
Joel|2|18|Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
Joel|2|19|And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;
Joel|2|20|but I will remove far off from you the northern {army}, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.
Joel|2|21|Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.
Joel|2|22|Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
Joel|2|23|Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first {month}.
Joel|2|24|And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
Joel|2|25|And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
Joel|2|26|And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.
Joel|2|27|And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.
Joel|2|28|And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
Joel|2|29|and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
Joel|2|30|And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
Joel|2|31|The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.
Joel|2|32|And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.
Joel|3|1|For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
Joel|3|2|I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,
Joel|3|3|and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
Joel|3|4|Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.
Joel|3|5|Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,
Joel|3|6|and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;
Joel|3|7|behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;
Joel|3|8|and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Joel|3|9|Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.
Joel|3|10|Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
Joel|3|11|Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.
Joel|3|12|Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
Joel|3|13|Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
Joel|3|14|Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.
Joel|3|15|The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|3|16|And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
Joel|3|17|So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
Joel|3|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
Joel|3|19|Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
Joel|3|20|But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
Joel|3|21|And I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.
Job|1|1|There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.
Job|1|2|And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job|1|3|His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.
Job|1|4|And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
Job|1|5|And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
Job|1|6|Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.
Job|1|7|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|1|8|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.
Job|1|9|Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Job|1|10|Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
Job|1|11|But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|1|12|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
Job|1|13|And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
Job|1|14|that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;
Job|1|15|and the Sabeans fell {upon them}, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|16|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|17|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|18|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
Job|1|19|and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|20|Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;
Job|1|21|and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.
Job|1|22|In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
Job|2|1|Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
Job|2|2|And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|2|3|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
Job|2|4|And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
Job|2|5|But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|2|6|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.
Job|2|7|So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
Job|2|8|And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.
Job|2|9|Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.
Job|2|10|But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
Job|2|11|Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
Job|2|12|And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
Job|2|13|So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
Job|3|1|After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
Job|3|2|And Job answered and said:
Job|3|3|Let the day perish wherein I was born,                   And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.
Job|3|4|Let that day be darkness;                   Let not God from above seek for it,                   Neither let the light shine upon it.
Job|3|5|Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;                   Let a cloud dwell upon it;                   Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
Job|3|6|As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:                   Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;                   Let it not come into the number of the months.
Job|3|7|Lo, let that night be barren;                   Let no joyful voice come therein.
Job|3|8|Let them curse it that curse the day,                   Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
Job|3|9|Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:                   Let it look for light, but have none;                   Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:
Job|3|10|Because it shut not up the doors of my {mother’s} womb,                   Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
Job|3|11|Why died I not from the womb?                   Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?
Job|3|12|Why did the knees receive me?                   Or why the breast, that I should suck?
Job|3|13|For now should I have lain down and been quiet;                   I should have slept; then had I been at rest,
Job|3|14|With kings and counsellors of the earth,                   Who built up waste places for themselves;
Job|3|15|Or with princes that had gold,                   Who filled their houses with silver:
Job|3|16|Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,                   As infants that never saw light.
Job|3|17|There the wicked cease from troubling;                   And there the weary are at rest.
Job|3|18|There the prisoners are at ease together;                   They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
Job|3|19|The small and the great are there:                   And the servant is free from his master.
Job|3|20|Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,                   And life unto the bitter in soul;
Job|3|21|Who long for death, but it cometh not,                   And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
Job|3|22|Who rejoice exceedingly,                   And are glad, when they can find the grave?
Job|3|23|{Why is light given} to a man whose way is hid,                   And whom God hath hedged in?
Job|3|24|For my sighing cometh before I eat,                   And my groanings are poured out like water.
Job|3|25|For the thing which I fear cometh upon me,                   And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.
Job|3|26|I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;                   But trouble cometh.
Job|4|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|4|2|If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?                   But who can withhold himself from speaking?
Job|4|3|Behold, thou hast instructed many,                   And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
Job|4|4|Thy words have upholden him that was falling,                   And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.
Job|4|5|But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;                   It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
Job|4|6|Is not thy fear {of God} thy confidence,                           {And} the integrity of thy ways thy hope?
Job|4|7|Remember, I pray thee, who {ever} perished, being innocent?                   Or where were the upright cut off?
Job|4|8|According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,                   And sow trouble, reap the same.
Job|4|9|By the breath of God they perish,                   And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.
Job|4|10|The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,                   And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
Job|4|11|The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,                   And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
Job|4|12|Now a thing was secretly brought to me,                   And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
Job|4|13|In thoughts from the visions of the night,                   When deep sleep falleth on men,
Job|4|14|Fear came upon me, and trembling,                   Which made all my bones to shake.
Job|4|15|Then a spirit passed before my face;                   The hair of my flesh stood up.
Job|4|16|It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;                   A form was before mine eyes:                           {There was} silence, and I heard a voice, {saying},
Job|4|17|Shall mortal man be more just than God?                   Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
Job|4|18|Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;                   And his angels he chargeth with folly:
Job|4|19|How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,                   Whose foundation is in the dust,                   Who are crushed before the moth!
Job|4|20|Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:                   They perish for ever without any regarding it.
Job|4|21|Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?                   They die, and that without wisdom.
Job|5|1|Call now; is there any that will answer thee?                   And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
Job|5|2|For vexation killeth the foolish man,                   And jealousy slayeth the silly one.
Job|5|3|I have seen the foolish taking root:                   But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
Job|5|4|His children are far from safety,                   And they are crushed in the gate,                   Neither is there any to deliver them:
Job|5|5|Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,                   And taketh it even out of the thorns;                   And the snare gapeth for their substance.
Job|5|6|For affliction cometh not forth from the dust,                   Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
Job|5|7|But man is born unto trouble,                   As the sparks fly upward.
Job|5|8|But as for me, I would seek unto God,                   And unto God would I commit my cause;
Job|5|9|Who doeth great things and unsearchable,                   Marvellous things without number:
Job|5|10|Who giveth rain upon the earth,                   And sendeth waters upon the fields;
Job|5|11|So that he setteth up on high those that are low,                   And those that mourn are exalted to safety.
Job|5|12|He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,                   So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
Job|5|13|He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;                   And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
Job|5|14|They meet with darkness in the day-time,                   And grope at noonday as in the night.
Job|5|15|But he saveth from the sword of their mouth,                   Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
Job|5|16|So the poor hath hope,                   And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
Job|5|17|Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth:                   Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
Job|5|18|For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;                   He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
Job|5|19|He will deliver thee in six troubles;                   Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
Job|5|20|In famine he will redeem thee from death;                   And in war from the power of the sword.
Job|5|21|Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;                   Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
Job|5|22|At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;                   Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
Job|5|23|For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;                   And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
Job|5|24|And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;                   And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.
Job|5|25|Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,                   And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
Job|5|26|Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,                   Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.
Job|5|27|Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;                   Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
Job|6|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|6|2|Oh that my vexation were but weighed,                   And all my calamity laid in the balances!
Job|6|3|For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:                   Therefore have my words been rash.
Job|6|4|For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,                   The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:                   The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
Job|6|5|Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?                   Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
Job|6|6|Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt?                   Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
Job|6|7|My soul refuseth to touch {them};                   They are as loathsome food to me.
Job|6|8|Oh that I might have my request;                   And that God would grant {me} the thing that I long for!
Job|6|9|Even that it would please God to crush me;                   That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
Job|6|10|And be it still my consolation,                   Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not,                   That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
Job|6|11|What is my strength, that I should wait?                   And what is mine end, that I should be patient?
Job|6|12|Is my strength the strength of stones?                   Or is my flesh of brass?
Job|6|13|Is it not that I have no help in me,                   And that wisdom is driven quite from me?
Job|6|14|To him that is ready to faint kindness {should be showed} from his friend;                   Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
Job|6|15|My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,                   As the channel of brooks that pass away;
Job|6|16|Which are black by reason of the ice,                           {And} wherein the snow hideth itself:
Job|6|17|What time they wax warm, they vanish;                   When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
Job|6|18|The caravans {that travel} by the way of them turn aside;                   They go up into the waste, and perish.
Job|6|19|The caravans of Tema looked,                   The companies of Sheba waited for them.
Job|6|20|They were put to shame because they had hoped;                   They came thither, and were confounded.
Job|6|21|For now ye are nothing;                   Ye see a terror, and are afraid.
Job|6|22|Did I say, Give unto me?                   Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?
Job|6|23|Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?                   Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
Job|6|24|Teach me, and I will hold my peace;                   And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
Job|6|25|How forcible are words of uprightness!                   But your reproof, what doth it reprove?
Job|6|26|Do ye think to reprove words,                   Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?
Job|6|27|Yea, ye would cast {lots} upon the fatherless,                   And make merchandise of your friend.
Job|6|28|Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;                   For surely I shall not lie to your face.
Job|6|29|Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;                   Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.
Job|6|30|Is there injustice on my tongue?                   Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?
Job|7|1|Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?                   And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
Job|7|2|As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,                   And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:
Job|7|3|So am I made to possess months of misery,                   And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
Job|7|4|When I lie down, I say,                   When shall I arise, and the night be gone?                   And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
Job|7|5|My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;                   My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.
Job|7|6|My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,                   And are spent without hope.
Job|7|7|Oh remember that my life is a breath:                   Mine eye shall no more see good.
Job|7|8|The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;                   Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
Job|7|9|As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,                   So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.
Job|7|10|He shall return no more to his house,                   Neither shall his place know him any more.
Job|7|11|Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;                   I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;                   I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job|7|12|Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,                   That thou settest a watch over me?
Job|7|13|When I say, My bed shall comfort me,                   My couch shall ease my complaint;
Job|7|14|Then thou scarest me with dreams,                   And terrifiest me through visions:
Job|7|15|So that my soul chooseth strangling,                   And death rather than {these} my bones.
Job|7|16|I loathe {my life}; I would not live alway:                   Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
Job|7|17|What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,                   And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,
Job|7|18|And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,                   And try him every moment?
Job|7|19|How long wilt thou not look away from me,                   Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
Job|7|20|If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men?                   Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,                   So that I am a burden to myself?
Job|7|21|And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?                   For now shall I lie down in the dust;                   And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
Job|8|1|Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|8|2|How long wilt thou speak these things?                   And {how long} shall the words of thy mouth be {like} a mighty wind?
Job|8|3|Doth God pervert justice?                   Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job|8|4|If thy children have sinned against him,                   And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;
Job|8|5|If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,                   And make thy supplication to the Almighty;
Job|8|6|If thou wert pure and upright:                   Surely now he would awake for thee,                   And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
Job|8|7|And though thy beginning was small,                   Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
Job|8|8|For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,                   And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:
Job|8|9|(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,                   Because our days upon earth are a shadow);
Job|8|10|Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,                   And utter words out of their heart?
Job|8|11|Can the rush grow up without mire?                   Can the flag grow without water?
Job|8|12|Whilst it is yet in its greenness, {and} not cut down,                   It withereth before any {other} herb.
Job|8|13|So are the paths of all that forget God;                   And the hope of the godless man shall perish:
Job|8|14|Whose confidence shall break in sunder,                   And whose trust is a spider’s web.
Job|8|15|He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:                   He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.
Job|8|16|He is green before the sun,                   And his shoots go forth over his garden.
Job|8|17|His roots are wrapped about the {stone} -heap,                   He beholdeth the place of stones.
Job|8|18|If he be destroyed from his place,                   Then it shall deny him, {saying}, I have not seen thee.
Job|8|19|Behold, this is the joy of his way;                   And out of the earth shall others spring.
Job|8|20|Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,                   Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.
Job|8|21|He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter,                   And thy lips with shouting.
Job|8|22|They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;                   And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.
Job|9|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|9|2|Of a truth I know that it is so:                   But how can man be just with God?
Job|9|3|If he be pleased to contend with him,                   He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
Job|9|4|{He is} wise in heart, and mighty in strength:                   Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?-
Job|9|5|{Him} that removeth the mountains, and they know it not,                   When he overturneth them in his anger;
Job|9|6|That shaketh the earth out of its place,                   And the pillars thereof tremble;
Job|9|7|That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,                   And sealeth up the stars;
Job|9|8|That alone stretcheth out the heavens,                   And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;
Job|9|9|That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,                   And the chambers of the south;
Job|9|10|That doeth great things past finding out,                   Yea, marvellous things without number.
Job|9|11|Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:                   He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
Job|9|12|Behold, he seizeth {the prey}, who can hinder him?                   Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
Job|9|13|God will not withdraw his anger;                   The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.
Job|9|14|How much less shall I answer him,                   And choose out my words {to reason} with him?
Job|9|15|Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;                   I would make supplication to my judge.
Job|9|16|If I had called, and he had answered me,                   Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.
Job|9|17|For he breaketh me with a tempest,                   And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
Job|9|18|He will not suffer me to take my breath,                   But filleth me with bitterness.
Job|9|19|If {we speak} of strength, lo, {he is} mighty!                   And if of justice, Who, {saith he}, will summon me?
Job|9|20|Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me:                   Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.
Job|9|21|I am perfect; I regard not myself;                   I despise my life.
Job|9|22|It is all one; therefore I say,                   He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
Job|9|23|If the scourge slay suddenly,                   He will mock at the trial of the innocent.
Job|9|24|The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;                   He covereth the faces of the judges thereof:                   If {it be} not {he}, who then is it?
Job|9|25|Now my days are swifter than a post:                   They flee away, they see no good,
Job|9|26|They are passed away as the swift ships;                   As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.
Job|9|27|If I say, I will forget my complaint,                   I will put off my {sad} countenance, and be of good cheer;
Job|9|28|I am afraid of all my sorrows,                   I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
Job|9|29|I shall be condemned;                   Why then do I labor in vain?
Job|9|30|If I wash myself with snow water,                   And make my hands never so clean;
Job|9|31|Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch,                   And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
Job|9|32|For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,                   That we should come together in judgment.
Job|9|33|There is no umpire betwixt us,                   That might lay his hand upon us both.
Job|9|34|Let him take his rod away from me,                   And let not his terror make me afraid:
Job|9|35|Then would I speak, and not fear him;                   For I am not so in myself.
Job|10|1|My soul is weary of my life;                   I will give free course to my complaint;                   I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job|10|2|I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;                   Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.
Job|10|3|Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,                   That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands,                   And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
Job|10|4|Hast thou eyes of flesh?                   Or seest thou as man seeth?
Job|10|5|Are thy days as the days of man,                   Or thy years as man’s days,
Job|10|6|That thou inquirest after mine iniquity,                   And searchest after my sin,
Job|10|7|Although thou knowest that I am not wicked,                   And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?
Job|10|8|Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me                   Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
Job|10|9|Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay;                   And wilt thou bring me into dust again?
Job|10|10|Hast thou not poured me out as milk,                   And curdled me like cheese?
Job|10|11|Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,                   And knit me together with bones and sinews.
Job|10|12|Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness;                   And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
Job|10|13|Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart;                   I know that this is with thee:
Job|10|14|If I sin, then thou markest me,                   And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
Job|10|15|If I be wicked, woe unto me;                   And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head;                   Being filled with ignominy,                   And looking upon mine affliction.
Job|10|16|And if {my head} exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion;                   And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.
Job|10|17|Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,                   And increasest thine indignation upon me:                   Changes and warfare are with me.
Job|10|18|Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?                   I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.
Job|10|19|I should have been as though I had not been;                   I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job|10|20|Are not my days few? cease then,                   And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
Job|10|21|Before I go whence I shall not return,                           {Even} to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
Job|10|22|The land dark as midnight,                           {The land} of the shadow of death, without any order,                   And where the light is as midnight.
Job|11|1|Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job|11|2|Should not the multitude of words be answered?                   And should a man full of talk be justified?
Job|11|3|Should thy boastings make men hold their peace?                   And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
Job|11|4|For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure,                   And I am clean in thine eyes.
Job|11|5|But oh that God would speak,                   And open his lips against thee,
Job|11|6|And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom!                   For he is manifold in understanding.                   Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
Job|11|7|Canst thou by searching find out God?                   Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
Job|11|8|It is high as heaven; what canst thou do?                   Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?
Job|11|9|The measure thereof is longer than the earth,                   And broader than the sea.
Job|11|10|If he pass through, and shut up,                   And all unto judgment, then who can hinder him?
Job|11|11|For he knoweth false men:                   He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.
Job|11|12|But vain man is void of understanding,                   Yea, man is born {as} a wild ass’s colt.
Job|11|13|If thou set thy heart aright,                   And stretch out thy hands toward him;
Job|11|14|If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away,                   And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.
Job|11|15|Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot;                   Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
Job|11|16|For thou shalt forget thy misery;                   Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,
Job|11|17|And {thy} life shall be clearer than the noonday;                    Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.
Job|11|18|And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope;                   Yea, thou shalt search {about thee}, and shalt take thy rest in safety.
Job|11|19|Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;                   Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
Job|11|20|But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,                   And they shall have no way to flee;                   And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.
Job|12|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|12|2|No doubt but ye are the people,                   And wisdom shall die with you.
Job|12|3|But I have understanding as well as you;                   I am not inferior to you:                   Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
Job|12|4|I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor,                   I who called upon God, and he answered:                   The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.
Job|12|5|In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune;                   It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.
Job|12|6|The tents of robbers prosper,                   And they that provoke God are secure;                   Into whose hand God bringeth {abundantly}.
Job|12|7|But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;                   And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:
Job|12|8|Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;                   And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
Job|12|9|Who knoweth not in all these,                   That the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this,
Job|12|10|In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,                   And the breath of all mankind?
Job|12|11|Doth not the ear try words,                   Even as the palate tasteth its food?
Job|12|12|With aged men is wisdom,                   And in length of days understanding.
Job|12|13|With {God} is wisdom and might;                   He hath counsel and understanding.
Job|12|14|Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again;                   He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
Job|12|15|Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;                   Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
Job|12|16|With him is strength and wisdom;                   The deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job|12|17|He leadeth counsellors away stripped,                   And judges maketh he fools.
Job|12|18|He looseth the bond of kings,                   And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.
Job|12|19|He leadeth priests away stripped,                   And overthroweth the mighty.
Job|12|20|He removeth the speech of the trusty,                   And taketh away the understanding of the elders.
Job|12|21|He poureth contempt upon princes,                   And looseth the belt of the strong.
Job|12|22|He uncovereth deep things out of darkness,                    And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
Job|12|23|He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them:                   He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.
Job|12|24|He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,                   And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
Job|12|25|They grope in the dark without light;                   And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
Job|13|1|Lo, mine eye hath seen all {this},                   Mine ear hath heard and understood it.
Job|13|2|What ye know, {the same} do I know also:                   I am not inferior unto you.
Job|13|3|Surely I would speak to the Almighty,                   And I desire to reason with God.
Job|13|4|But ye are forgers of lies;                   Ye are all physicians of no value.
Job|13|5|Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace!                   And it would be your wisdom.
Job|13|6|Hear now my reasoning,                   And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
Job|13|7|Will ye speak unrighteously for God,                   And talk deceitfully for him?
Job|13|8|Will ye show partiality to him?                   Will ye contend for God?
Job|13|9|Is it good that he should search you out?                   Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?
Job|13|10|He will surely reprove you                   If ye do secretly show partiality.
Job|13|11|Shall not his majesty make you afraid,                   And his dread fall upon you?
Job|13|12|Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes,                   Your defences are defences of clay.
Job|13|13|Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak;                   And let come on me what will.
Job|13|14|Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth,                   And put my life in my hand?
Job|13|15|Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope:                   Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.
Job|13|16|This also shall be my salvation,                   That a godless man shall not come before him.
Job|13|17|Hear diligently my speech,                   And let my declaration be in your ears.
Job|13|18|Behold now, I have set my cause in order;                   I know that I am righteous.
Job|13|19|Who is he that will contend with me?                   For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.
Job|13|20|Only do not two things unto me;                   Then will I not hide myself from thy face:
Job|13|21|Withdraw thy hand far from me;                   And let not thy terror make me afraid.
Job|13|22|Then call thou, and I will answer;                   Or let me speak, and answer thou me.
Job|13|23|How many are mine iniquities and sins?                   Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
Job|13|24|Wherefore hidest thou thy face,                   And holdest me for thine enemy?
Job|13|25|Wilt thou harass a driven leaf?                   And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
Job|13|26|For thou writest bitter things against me,                   And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:
Job|13|27|Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,                   And markest all my paths;                   Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:
Job|13|28|Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth,                   Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Job|14|1|Man, that is born of a woman,                   Is of few days, and full of trouble.
Job|14|2|He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down:                   He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
Job|14|3|And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one,                   And bringest me into judgment with thee?
Job|14|4|Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
Job|14|5|Seeing his days are determined,                   The number of his months is with thee,                   And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
Job|14|6|Look away from him, that he may rest,                   Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
Job|14|7|For there is hope of a tree,                   If it be cut down, that it will sprout again,                   And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
Job|14|8|Though the root thereof wax old in the earth,                   And the stock thereof die in the ground;
Job|14|9|Yet through the scent of water it will bud,                   And put forth boughs like a plant.
Job|14|10|But man dieth, and is laid low:                   Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
Job|14|11|{As} the waters fail from the sea,                   And the river wasteth and drieth up;
Job|14|12|So man lieth down and riseth not:                   Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,                   Nor be roused out of their sleep.
Job|14|13|Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol,                   That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,                   That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
Job|14|14|If a man die, shall he live {again}?                   All the days of my warfare would I wait,                   Till my release should come.
Job|14|15|Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee:                   Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.
Job|14|16|But now thou numberest my steps:                   Dost thou not watch over my sin?
Job|14|17|My transgression is sealed up in a bag,                   And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.
Job|14|18|But the mountain falling cometh to nought;                   And the rock is removed out of its place;
Job|14|19|The waters wear the stones;                   The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth:                   So thou destroyest the hope of man.
Job|14|20|Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth;                   Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
Job|14|21|His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not;                   And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
Job|14|22|But his flesh upon him hath pain,                   And his soul within him mourneth.
Job|15|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|15|2|Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge,                   And fill himself with the east wind?
Job|15|3|Should he reason with unprofitable talk,                   Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
Job|15|4|Yea, thou doest away with fear,                   And hinderest devotion before God.
Job|15|5|For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth,                   And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
Job|15|6|Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;                   Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
Job|15|7|Art thou the first man that was born?                   Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?
Job|15|8|Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God?                   And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?
Job|15|9|What knowest thou, that we know not?                   What understandest thou, which is not in us?
Job|15|10|With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,                   Much elder than thy father.
Job|15|11|Are the consolations of God too small for thee,                   Even the word that is gentle toward thee?
Job|15|12|Why doth thy heart carry thee away?                   And why do thine eyes flash,
Job|15|13|That against God thou turnest thy spirit,                   And lettest words go out of thy mouth?
Job|15|14|What is man, that he should be clean?                   And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
Job|15|15|Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones;                   Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:
Job|15|16|How much less one that is abominable and corrupt,                   A man that drinketh iniquity like water!
Job|15|17|I will show thee, hear thou me;                   And that which I have seen I will declare:
Job|15|18|(Which wise men have told                   From their fathers, and have not hid it;
Job|15|19|Unto whom alone the land was given,                   And no stranger passed among them):
Job|15|20|The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days,                   Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
Job|15|21|A sound of terrors is in his ears;                   In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
Job|15|22|He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness,                   And he is waited for of the sword.
Job|15|23|He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where is it?                   He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
Job|15|24|Distress and anguish make him afraid;                   They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
Job|15|25|Because he hath stretched out his hand against God,                   And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;
Job|15|26|He runneth upon him with a {stiff} neck,                   With the thick bosses of his bucklers;
Job|15|27|Because he hath covered his face with his fatness,                   And gathered fat upon his loins;
Job|15|28|And he hath dwelt in desolate cities,                   In houses which no man inhabited,                   Which were ready to become heaps;
Job|15|29|He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,                   Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
Job|15|30|He shall not depart out of darkness;                   The flame shall dry up his branches,                   And by the breath of {God’s} mouth shall he go away.
Job|15|31|Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;                   For vanity shall be his recompense.
Job|15|32|It shall be accomplished before his time,                   And his branch shall not be green.
Job|15|33|He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine,                   And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.
Job|15|34|For the company of the godless shall be barren,                   And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
Job|15|35|They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity,                   And their heart prepareth deceit.
Job|16|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|16|2|I have heard many such things:                   Miserable comforters are ye all.
Job|16|3|Shall vain words have an end?                   Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
Job|16|4|I also could speak as ye do;                   If your soul were in my soul’s stead,                   I could join words together against you,                   And shake my head at you.
Job|16|5|{But} I would strengthen you with my mouth,                   And the solace of my lips would assuage {your grief}.
Job|16|6|Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged;                   And though I forbear, what am I eased?
Job|16|7|But now he hath made me weary:                   Thou hast made desolate all my company.
Job|16|8|And thou hast laid fast hold on me, {which} is a witness {against me}:                   And my leanness riseth up against me,                   It testifieth to my face.
Job|16|9|He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;                   He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth:                   Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
Job|16|10|They have gaped upon me with their mouth;                   They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully:                   They gather themselves together against me.
Job|16|11|God delivereth me to the ungodly,                   And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
Job|16|12|I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;                   Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:                   He hath also set me up for his mark.
Job|16|13|His archers compass me round about;                   He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;                   He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
Job|16|14|He breaketh me with breach upon breach;                   He runneth upon me like a giant.
Job|16|15|I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,                   And have laid my horn in the dust.
Job|16|16|My face is red with weeping,                   And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
Job|16|17|Although there is no violence in my hands,                   And my prayer is pure.
Job|16|18|O earth, cover not thou my blood,                   And let my cry have no {resting} -place.
Job|16|19|Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,                   And he that voucheth for me is on high.
Job|16|20|My friends scoff at me:                           {But} mine eye poureth out tears unto God,
Job|16|21|That he would maintain the right of a man with God,                   And of a son of man with his neighbor!
Job|16|22|For when a few years are come,                   I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
Job|17|1|My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,                   The grave is {ready} for me.
Job|17|2|Surely there are mockers with me,                   And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.
Job|17|3|Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;                   Who is there that will strike hands with me?
Job|17|4|For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:                   Therefore shalt thou not exalt {them}.
Job|17|5|He that denounceth his friends for a prey,                   Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
Job|17|6|But he hath made me a byword of the people;                   And they spit in my face.
Job|17|7|Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,                   And all my members are as a shadow.
Job|17|8|Upright men shall be astonished at this,                   And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
Job|17|9|Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,                   And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.
Job|17|10|But as for you all, come on now again;                   And I shall not find a wise man among you.
Job|17|11|My days are past, my purposes are broken off,                   Even the thoughts of my heart.
Job|17|12|They change the night into day:                   The light, {say they}, is near unto the darkness.
Job|17|13|If I look for Sheol as my house;                   If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
Job|17|14|If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father;                   To the worm, {Thou art} my mother, and my sister;
Job|17|15|Where then is my hope?                   And as for my hope, who shall see it?
Job|17|16|It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,                   When once there is rest in the dust.
Job|18|1|Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|18|2|How long will ye hunt for words?                   Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
Job|18|3|Wherefore are we counted as beasts,                           {And} are become unclean in your sight?
Job|18|4|Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger,                   Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?                   Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
Job|18|5|Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out,                   And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
Job|18|6|The light shall be dark in his tent,                   And his lamp above him shall be put out.
Job|18|7|The steps of his strength shall be straitened,                   And his own counsel shall cast him down.
Job|18|8|For he is cast into a net by his own feet,                   And he walketh upon the toils.
Job|18|9|A gin shall take {him} by the heel,                           {And} a snare shall lay hold on him.
Job|18|10|A noose is hid for him in the ground,                   And a trap for him in the way.
Job|18|11|Terrors shall make him afraid on every side,                   And shall chase him at his heels.
Job|18|12|His strength shall be hunger-bitten,                   And calamity shall be ready at his side.
Job|18|13|The members of his body shall be devoured,                           {Yea}, the first-born of death shall devour his members.
Job|18|14|He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth;                   And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
Job|18|15|There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his:                   Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
Job|18|16|His roots shall be dried up beneath,                   And above shall his branch be cut off.
Job|18|17|His remembrance shall perish from the earth,                   And he shall have no name in the street.
Job|18|18|He shall be driven from light into darkness,                   And chased out of the world.
Job|18|19|He shall have neither son nor son’s son among his people,                   Nor any remaining where he sojourned.
Job|18|20|They that come after shall be astonished at his day,                   As they that went before were affrighted.
Job|18|21|Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous,                   And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
Job|19|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|19|2|How long will ye vex my soul,                   And break me in pieces with words?
Job|19|3|These ten times have ye reproached me:                   Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
Job|19|4|And be it indeed that I have erred,                   Mine error remaineth with myself.
Job|19|5|If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,                   And plead against me my reproach;
Job|19|6|Know now that God hath subverted me {in my cause},                   And hath compassed me with his net.
Job|19|7|Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:                   I cry for help, but there is no justice.
Job|19|8|He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass,                   And hath set darkness in my paths.
Job|19|9|He hath stripped me of my glory,                   And taken the crown from my head.
Job|19|10|He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone;                   And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.
Job|19|11|He hath also kindled his wrath against me,                   And he counteth me unto him as {one of} his adversaries.
Job|19|12|His troops come on together,                   And cast up their way against me,                   And encamp round about my tent.
Job|19|13|He hath put my brethren far from me,                   And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
Job|19|14|My kinsfolk have failed,                   And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
Job|19|15|They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger;                   I am an alien in their sight.
Job|19|16|I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer,                           {Though} I entreat him with my mouth.
Job|19|17|My breath is strange to my wife,                   And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.
Job|19|18|Even young children despise me;                   If I arise, they speak against me.
Job|19|19|All my familiar friends abhor me,                   And they whom I loved are turned against me.
Job|19|20|My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,                   And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
Job|19|21|Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;                   For the hand of God hath touched me.
Job|19|22|Why do ye persecute me as God,                   And are not satisfied with my flesh?
Job|19|23|Oh that my words were now written!                   Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
Job|19|24|That with an iron pen and lead                   They were graven in the rock for ever!
Job|19|25|But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth,                   And at last he will stand up upon the earth:
Job|19|26|And after my skin, {even} this {body}, is destroyed,                   Then without my flesh shall I see God;
Job|19|27|Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,                   And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.                   My heart is consumed within me.
Job|19|28|If ye say, How we will persecute him!                   And that the root of the matter is found in me;
Job|19|29|Be ye afraid of the sword:                   For wrath {bringeth} the punishments of the sword,                   That ye may know there is a judgment.
Job|20|1|Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
Job|20|2|Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,                   Even by reason of my haste that is in me.
Job|20|3|I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame;                   And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.
Job|20|4|Knowest thou {not} this of old time,                   Since man was placed upon earth,
Job|20|5|That the triumphing of the wicked is short,                   And the joy of the godless but for a moment?
Job|20|6|Though his height mount up to the heavens,                   And his head reach unto the clouds;
Job|20|7|Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:                   They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?
Job|20|8|He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:                   Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
Job|20|9|The eye which saw him shall see him no more;                   Neither shall his place any more behold him.
Job|20|10|His children shall seek the favor of the poor,                   And his hands shall give back his wealth.
Job|20|11|His bones are full of his youth,                   But it shall lie down with him in the dust.
Job|20|12|Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,                   Though he hide it under his tongue,
Job|20|13|Though he spare it, and will not let it go,                   But keep it still within his mouth;
Job|20|14|Yet his food in his bowels is turned,                   It is the gall of asps within him.
Job|20|15|He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again;                   God will cast them out of his belly.
Job|20|16|He shall suck the poison of asps:                   The viper’s tongue shall slay him.
Job|20|17|He shall not look upon the rivers,                   The flowing streams of honey and butter.
Job|20|18|That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down;                   According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
Job|20|19|For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;                   He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
Job|20|20|Because he knew no quietness within him,                   He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.
Job|20|21|There was nothing left that he devoured not;                   Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
Job|20|22|In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:                   The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
Job|20|23|When he is about to fill his belly, {God} will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him,                   And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
Job|20|24|He shall flee from the iron weapon,                   And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
Job|20|25|He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body;                   Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall:                   Terrors are upon him.
Job|20|26|All darkness is laid up for his treasures:                   A fire not blown {by man} shall devour him;                   It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job|20|27|The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,                   And the earth shall rise up against him.
Job|20|28|The increase of his house shall depart;                           {His goods} shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
Job|20|29|This is the portion of a wicked man from God,                   And the heritage appointed unto him by God.
Job|21|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|21|2|Hear diligently my speech;                   And let this be your consolations.
Job|21|3|Suffer me, and I also will speak;                   And after that I have spoken, mock on.
Job|21|4|As for me, is my complaint to man?                   And why should I not be impatient?
Job|21|5|Mark me, and be astonished,                    And lay your hand upon your mouth.
Job|21|6|Even when I remember I am troubled,                   And horror taketh hold on my flesh.
Job|21|7|Wherefore do the wicked live,                   Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
Job|21|8|Their seed is established with them in their sight,                   And their offspring before their eyes.
Job|21|9|Their houses are safe from fear,                   Neither is the rod of God upon them.
Job|21|10|Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;                   Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
Job|21|11|They send forth their little ones like a flock,                   And their children dance.
Job|21|12|They sing to the timbrel and harp,                   And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
Job|21|13|They spend their days in prosperity,                   And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
Job|21|14|And they say unto God, Depart from us;                   For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
Job|21|15|What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?                   And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
Job|21|16|Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:                   The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|21|17|How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?                   That their calamity cometh upon them?                   That {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger?
Job|21|18|That they are as stubble before the wind,                   And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
Job|21|19|{Ye say}, God layeth up his iniquity for his children.                   Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:
Job|21|20|Let his own eyes see his destruction,                   And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job|21|21|For what careth he for his house after him,                   When the number of his months is cut off?
Job|21|22|Shall any teach God knowledge,                   Seeing he judgeth those that are high?
Job|21|23|One dieth in his full strength,                   Being wholly at ease and quiet:
Job|21|24|His pails are full of milk,                   And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job|21|25|And another dieth in bitterness of soul,                   And never tasteth of good.
Job|21|26|They lie down alike in the dust,                   And the worm covereth them.
Job|21|27|Behold, I know your thoughts,                   And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.
Job|21|28|For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?                   And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
Job|21|29|Have ye not asked wayfaring men?                   And do ye not know their evidences,
Job|21|30|That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?                   That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
Job|21|31|Who shall declare his way to his face?                   And who shall repay him what he hath done?
Job|21|32|Yet shall he be borne to the grave,                   And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
Job|21|33|The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,                   And all men shall draw after him,                   As there were innumerable before him.
Job|21|34|How then comfort ye me in vain,                   Seeing in your answers there remaineth {only} falsehood?
Job|22|1|Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job|22|2|Can a man be profitable unto God?                   Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
Job|22|3|Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?                   Or is it gain {to him}, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
Job|22|4|Is it for thy fear {of him} that he reproveth thee,                   That he entereth with thee into judgment?
Job|22|5|Is not thy wickedness great?                   Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
Job|22|6|For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,                   And stripped the naked of their clothing.
Job|22|7|Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,                   And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
Job|22|8|But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;                   And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.
Job|22|9|Thou hast sent widows away empty,                   And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
Job|22|10|Therefore snares are round about thee,                   And sudden fear troubleth thee,
Job|22|11|Or darkness, so that thou canst not see,                   And abundance of waters cover thee.
Job|22|12|Is not God in the height of heaven?                   And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
Job|22|13|And thou sayest, What doth God know?                   Can he judge through the thick darkness?
Job|22|14|Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not;                   And he walketh on the vault of heaven.
Job|22|15|Wilt thou keep the old way                   Which wicked men have trodden?
Job|22|16|Who were snatched away before their time,                   Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
Job|22|17|Who said unto God, Depart from us;                   And, What can the Almighty do for us?
Job|22|18|Yet he filled their houses with good things:                   But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
Job|22|19|The righteous see it, and are glad;                   And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
Job|22|20|{Saying}, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off,                   And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.
Job|22|21|Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:                   Thereby good shall come unto thee.
Job|22|22|Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,                   And lay up his words in thy heart.
Job|22|23|If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,                   If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.
Job|22|24|And lay thou {thy} treasure in the dust,                   And {the gold of} Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
Job|22|25|And the Almighty will be thy treasure,                   And precious silver unto thee.
Job|22|26|For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty,                   And shalt lift up thy face unto God.
Job|22|27|Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee;                   And thou shalt pay thy vows.
Job|22|28|Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee;                   And light shall shine upon thy ways.
Job|22|29|When they cast {thee} down, thou shalt say, {There is} lifting up;                   And the humble person he will save.
Job|22|30|He will deliver {even} him that is not innocent:                   Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
Job|23|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|23|2|Even to-day is my complaint rebellious:                   My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
Job|23|3|Oh that I knew where I might find him!                   That I might come even to his seat!
Job|23|4|I would set my cause in order before him,                   And fill my mouth with arguments.
Job|23|5|I would know the words which he would answer me,                   And understand what he would say unto me.
Job|23|6|Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?                   Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
Job|23|7|There the upright might reason with him;                   So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
Job|23|8|Behold, I go forward, but he is not {there};                   And backward, but I cannot perceive him;
Job|23|9|On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him;                   He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
Job|23|10|But he knoweth the way that I take;                   When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
Job|23|11|My foot hath held fast to his steps;                   His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
Job|23|12|I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips;                   I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
Job|23|13|But he is in one {mind}, and who can turn him?                   And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
Job|23|14|For he performeth that which is appointed for me:                   And many such things are with him.
Job|23|15|Therefore am I terrified at his presence;                   When I consider, I am afraid of him.
Job|23|16|For God hath made my heart faint,                   And the Almighty hath terrified me;
Job|23|17|Because I was not cut off before the darkness,                   Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
Job|24|1|Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?                   And why do not they that know him see his days?
Job|24|2|There are that remove the landmarks;                   They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
Job|24|3|They drive away the ass of the fatherless;                   They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
Job|24|4|They turn the needy out of the way:                   The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
Job|24|5|Behold, as wild asses in the desert                   They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;                   The wilderness {yieldeth} them bread for their children.
Job|24|6|They cut their provender in the field;                   And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
Job|24|7|They lie all night naked without clothing,                   And have no covering in the cold.
Job|24|8|They are wet with the showers of the mountains,                   And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
Job|24|9|There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,                   And take a pledge of the poor;
Job|24|10|{So that} they go about naked without clothing,                   And being hungry they carry the sheaves.
Job|24|11|They make oil within the walls of these men;                    They tread {their} winepresses, and suffer thirst.
Job|24|12|From out of the populous city men groan,                    And the soul of the wounded crieth out:                    Yet God regardeth not the folly.
Job|24|13|These are of them that rebel against the light;                   They know not the ways thereof,                   Nor abide in the paths thereof.
Job|24|14|The murderer riseth with the light;                   He killeth the poor and needy;                   And in the night he is as a thief.
Job|24|15|The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,                   Saying, No eye shall see me:                   And he disguiseth his face.
Job|24|16|In the dark they dig through houses:                   They shut themselves up in the day-time;                   They know not the light.
Job|24|17|For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness;                   For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
Job|24|18|Swiftly they {pass away} upon the face of the waters;                   Their portion is cursed in the earth:                   They turn not into the way of the vineyards.
Job|24|19|Drought and heat consume the snow waters:                           {So doth} Sheol {those that} have sinned.
Job|24|20|The womb shall forget him;                   The worm shall feed sweetly on him;                   He shall be no more remembered;                   And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
Job|24|21|He devoureth the barren that beareth not,                   And doeth not good to the widow.
Job|24|22|Yet {God} preserveth the mighty by his power:                   He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.
Job|24|23|{God} giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon;                   And his eyes are upon their ways.
Job|24|24|They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;                   Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,                   And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
Job|24|25|And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,                   And make my speech nothing worth?
Job|25|1|Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
Job|25|2|Dominion and fear are with him;                   He maketh peace in his high places.
Job|25|3|Is there any number of his armies?                   And upon whom doth not his light arise?
Job|25|4|How then can man be just with God?                   Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
Job|25|5|Behold, even the moon hath no brightness,                   And the stars are not pure in his sight:
Job|25|6|How much less man, that is a worm!                   And the son of man, that is a worm!
Job|26|1|Then Job answered and said,
Job|26|2|How hast thou helped him that is without power!                   How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
Job|26|3|How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,                   And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
Job|26|4|To whom hast thou uttered words?                   And whose spirit came forth from thee?
Job|26|5|They that are deceased tremble                   Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
Job|26|6|Sheol is naked before {God},                   And Abaddon hath no covering.
Job|26|7|He stretcheth out the north over empty space,                   And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
Job|26|8|He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds;                   And the cloud is not rent under them.
Job|26|9|He incloseth the face of his throne,                   And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
Job|26|10|He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters,                   Unto the confines of light and darkness.
Job|26|11|The pillars of heaven tremble                   And are astonished at his rebuke.
Job|26|12|He stirreth up the sea with his power,                   And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
Job|26|13|By his Spirit the heavens are garnished;                   His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
Job|26|14|Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways:                   And how small a whisper do we hear of him!                   But the thunder of his power who can understand?
Job|27|1|And Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job|27|2|As God liveth, who hath taken away my right,                   And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:
Job|27|3|(For my life is yet whole in me,                   And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);
Job|27|4|Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,                   Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
Job|27|5|Far be it from me that I should justify you:                   Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
Job|27|6|My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:                   My heart shall not reproach {me} so long as I live.
Job|27|7|Let mine enemy be as the wicked,                   And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
Job|27|8|For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain,                   When God taketh away his soul?
Job|27|9|Will God hear his cry,                   When trouble cometh upon him?
Job|27|10|Will he delight himself in the Almighty,                   And call upon God at all times?
Job|27|11|I will teach you concerning the hand of God;                   That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Job|27|12|Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;                   Why then are ye become altogether vain?
Job|27|13|This is the portion of a wicked man with God,                   And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:
Job|27|14|If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;                   And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Job|27|15|Those that remain of him shall be buried in death,                   And his widows shall make no lamentation.
Job|27|16|Though he heap up silver as the dust,                   And prepare raiment as the clay;
Job|27|17|He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,                   And the innocent shall divide the silver.
Job|27|18|He buildeth his house as the moth,                   And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
Job|27|19|He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered {to his fathers};                   He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
Job|27|20|Terrors overtake him like waters;                   A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
Job|27|21|The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;                   And it sweepeth him out of his place.
Job|27|22|For {God} shall hurl at him, and not spare:                   He would fain flee out of his hand.
Job|27|23|Men shall clap their hands at him,                   And shall hiss him out of his place.
Job|28|1|Surely there is a mine for silver,                    And a place for gold which they refine.
Job|28|2|Iron is taken out of the earth,                   And copper is molten out of the stone.
Job|28|3|{Man} setteth an end to darkness,                   And searcheth out, to the furthest bound,                   The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
Job|28|4|He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;                   They are forgotten of the foot;                   They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
Job|28|5|As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;                   And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
Job|28|6|The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,                   And it hath dust of gold.
Job|28|7|That path no bird of prey knoweth,                   Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it:
Job|28|8|The proud beasts have not trodden it,                   Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.
Job|28|9|He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;                   He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
Job|28|10|He cutteth out channels among the rocks;                   And his eye seeth every precious thing.
Job|28|11|He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;                    And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
Job|28|12|But where shall wisdom be found?                   And where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|13|Man knoweth not the price thereof;                   Neither is it found in the land of the living.
Job|28|14|The deep saith, It is not in me;                   And the sea saith, It is not with me.
Job|28|15|It cannot be gotten for gold,                   Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
Job|28|16|It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,                   With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
Job|28|17|Gold and glass cannot equal it,                   Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
Job|28|18|No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:                   Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
Job|28|19|The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,                   Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Job|28|20|Whence then cometh wisdom?                   And where is the place of understanding?
Job|28|21|Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,                   And kept close from the birds of the heavens.
Job|28|22|Destruction and Death say,                   We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.
Job|28|23|God understandeth the way thereof,                   And he knoweth the place thereof.
Job|28|24|For he looketh to the ends of the earth,                   And seeth under the whole heaven;
Job|28|25|To make a weight for the wind:                   Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.
Job|28|26|When he made a decree for the rain,                   And a way for the lightning of the thunder;
Job|28|27|Then did he see it, and declare it;                   He established it, yea, and searched it out.
Job|28|28|And unto man he said,                   Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;                   And to depart from evil is understanding.
Job|29|1|And Job again took up his parable, and said,
Job|29|2|Oh that I were as in the months of old,                   As in the days when God watched over me;
Job|29|3|When his lamp shined upon my head,                   And by his light I walked through darkness;
Job|29|4|As I was in the ripeness of my days,                   When the friendship of God was upon my tent;
Job|29|5|When the Almighty was yet with me,                   And my children were about me;
Job|29|6|When my steps were washed with butter,                   And the rock poured me out streams of oil!
Job|29|7|When I went forth to the gate unto the city,                   When I prepared my seat in the street,
Job|29|8|The young men saw me and hid themselves,                   And the aged rose up and stood;
Job|29|9|The princes refrained from talking,                   And laid their hand on their mouth;
Job|29|10|The voice of the nobles was hushed,                   And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
Job|29|11|For when the ear heard {me}, then it blessed me;                   And when the eye saw {me}, it gave witness unto me:
Job|29|12|Because I delivered the poor that cried,                   The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
Job|29|13|The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;                   And I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
Job|29|14|I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:                   My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
Job|29|15|I was eyes to the blind,                   And feet was I to the lame.
Job|29|16|I was a father to the needy:                   And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
Job|29|17|And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous,                   And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
Job|29|18|Then I said, I shall die in my nest,                   And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
Job|29|19|My root is spread out to the waters,                   And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;
Job|29|20|My glory is fresh in me,                   And my bow is renewed in my hand.
Job|29|21|Unto me men gave ear, and waited,                   And kept silence for my counsel.
Job|29|22|After my words they spake not again;                   And my speech distilled upon them.
Job|29|23|And they waited for me as for the rain;                   And they opened their mouth wide {as} for the latter rain.
Job|29|24|I smiled on them, when they had no confidence;                   And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
Job|29|25|I chose out their way, and sat {as} chief,                   And dwelt as a king in the army,                   As one that comforteth the mourners.
Job|30|1|But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,                   Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
Job|30|2|Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?                   Men in whom ripe age is perished.
Job|30|3|They are gaunt with want and famine;                   They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
Job|30|4|They pluck salt-wort by the bushes;                    And the roots of the broom are their food.
Job|30|5|They are driven forth from the midst {of men};                   They cry after them as after a thief;
Job|30|6|So that they dwell in frightful valleys,                   In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Job|30|7|Among the bushes they bray;                   Under the nettles they are gathered together.
Job|30|8|{They are} children of fools, yea, children of base men;                   They were scourged out of the land.
Job|30|9|And now I am become their song,                   Yea, I am a byword unto them.
Job|30|10|They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,                   And spare not to spit in my face.
Job|30|11|For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me;                   And they have cast off the bridle before me.
Job|30|12|Upon my right hand rise the rabble;                   They thrust aside my feet,                   And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
Job|30|13|They mar my path,                   They set forward my calamity,                           {Even} men that have no helper.
Job|30|14|As through a wide breach they come:                   In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves {upon me}.
Job|30|15|Terrors are turned upon me;                   They chase mine honor as the wind;                   And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
Job|30|16|And now my soul is poured out within me;                   Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
Job|30|17|In the night season my bones are pierced in me,                   And the {pains} that gnaw me take no rest.
Job|30|18|By {God’s} great force is my garment disfigured;                   It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
Job|30|19|He hath cast me into the mire,                   And I am become like dust and ashes.
Job|30|20|I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me:                   I stand up, and thou gazest at me.
Job|30|21|Thou art turned to be cruel to me;                   With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.
Job|30|22|Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride {upon it};                    And thou dissolvest me in the storm.
Job|30|23|For I know that thou wilt bring me to death,                   And to the house appointed for all living.
Job|30|24|Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall?                   Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
Job|30|25|Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?                   Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
Job|30|26|When I looked for good, then evil came;                   And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
Job|30|27|My heart is troubled, and resteth not;                    Days of affliction are come upon me.
Job|30|28|I go mourning without the sun:                   I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
Job|30|29|I am a brother to jackals,                   And a companion to ostriches.
Job|30|30|My skin is black, {and falleth} from me,                   And my bones are burned with heat.
Job|30|31|Therefore is my harp {turned} to mourning,                   And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
Job|31|1|I made a covenant with mine eyes;                   How then should I look upon a virgin?
Job|31|2|For what is the portion from God above,                   And the heritage from the Almighty on high?
Job|31|3|Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,                   And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
Job|31|4|Doth not he see my ways,                   And number all my steps?
Job|31|5|If I have walked with falsehood,                   And my foot hath hasted to deceit
Job|31|6|(Let me be weighed in an even balance,                   That God may know mine integrity);
Job|31|7|If my step hath turned out of the way,                   And my heart walked after mine eyes,                   And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:
Job|31|8|Then let me sow, and let another eat;                   Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
Job|31|9|If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman,                   And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;
Job|31|10|Then let my wife grind unto another,                   And let others bow down upon her.
Job|31|11|For that were a heinous crime;                   Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
Job|31|12|For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction,                   And would root out all mine increase.
Job|31|13|If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant,                   When they contended with me;
Job|31|14|What then shall I do when God riseth up?                   And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Job|31|15|Did not he that made me in the womb make him?                   And did not one fashion us in the womb?
Job|31|16|If I have withheld the poor from {their} desire,                   Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
Job|31|17|Or have eaten my morsel alone,                   And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
Job|31|18|(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,                    And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);
Job|31|19|If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,                   Or that the needy had no covering;
Job|31|20|If his loins have not blessed me,                   And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
Job|31|21|If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,                   Because I saw my help in the gate:
Job|31|22|Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,                   And mine arm be broken from the bone.
Job|31|23|For calamity from God is a terror to me,                   And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.
Job|31|24|If I have made gold my hope,                   And have said to the fine gold, {Thou art} my confidence;
Job|31|25|If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,                   And because my hand had gotten much;
Job|31|26|If I have beheld the sun when it shined,                   Or the moon walking in brightness,
Job|31|27|And my heart hath been secretly enticed,                   And my mouth hath kissed my hand:
Job|31|28|This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges;                   For I should have denied the God that is above.
Job|31|29|If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,                   Or lifted up myself when evil found him;
Job|31|30|(Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin                   By asking his life with a curse);
Job|31|31|If the men of my tent have not said,                   Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?
Job|31|32|(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street;                   But I have opened my doors to the traveller);
Job|31|33|If like Adam I have covered my transgressions,                   By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,
Job|31|34|Because I feared the great multitude,                   And the contempt of families terrified me,                   So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door-
Job|31|35|Oh that I had one to hear me!                   (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me);                   And {that I had} the indictment which mine adversary hath written!
Job|31|36|Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;                   I would bind it unto me as a crown:
Job|31|37|I would declare unto him the number of my steps;                   As a prince would I go near unto him.
Job|31|38|If my land crieth out against me,                   And the furrows thereof weep together;
Job|31|39|If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,                   Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Job|31|40|Let thistles grow instead of wheat,                   And cockle instead of barley.                  The words of Job are ended.
Job|32|1|So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job|32|2|Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job|32|3|Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job|32|4|Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.
Job|32|5|And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
Job|32|6|And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,             I am young, and ye are very old;                   Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.
Job|32|7|I said, Days should speak,                   And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
Job|32|8|But there is a spirit in man,                   And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Job|32|9|It is not the great that are wise,                   Nor the aged that understand justice.
Job|32|10|Therefore I said, Hearken to me;                   I also will show mine opinion.
Job|32|11|Behold, I waited for your words,                   I listened for your reasonings,                   Whilst ye searched out what to say.
Job|32|12|Yea, I attended unto you,                   And, behold, there was none that convinced Job,                   Or that answered his words, among you.
Job|32|13|Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom;                   God may vanquish him, not man:
Job|32|14|For he hath not directed his words against me;                   Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
Job|32|15|They are amazed, they answer no more:                   They have not a word to say.
Job|32|16|And shall I wait, because they speak not,                   Because they stand still, and answer no more?
Job|32|17|I also will answer my part,                   I also will show mine opinion.
Job|32|18|For I am full of words;                   The spirit within me constraineth me.
Job|32|19|Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent;                   Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
Job|32|20|I will speak, that I may be refreshed;                   I will open my lips and answer.
Job|32|21|Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person;                   Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
Job|32|22|For I know not to give flattering titles;                           {Else} would my Maker soon take me away.
Job|33|1|Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech,                   And hearken to all my words.
Job|33|2|Behold now, I have opened my mouth;                   My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
Job|33|3|My words {shall utter} the uprightness of my heart;                   And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
Job|33|4|The Spirit of God hath made me,                   And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.
Job|33|5|If thou canst, answer thou me;                   Set {thy words} in order before me, stand forth.
Job|33|6|Behold, I am toward God even as thou art:                   I also am formed out of the clay.
Job|33|7|Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,                   Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.
Job|33|8|Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing,                   And I have heard the voice of {thy} words, {saying},
Job|33|9|I am clean, without transgression;                   I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:
Job|33|10|Behold, he findeth occasions against me,                   He counteth me for his enemy:
Job|33|11|He putteth my feet in the stocks,                   He marketh all my paths.
Job|33|12|Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just;                   For God is greater than man.
Job|33|13|Why dost thou strive against him,                   For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?
Job|33|14|For God speaketh once,                   Yea twice, {though man} regardeth it not.
Job|33|15|In a dream, in a vision of the night,                   When deep sleep falleth upon men,                   In slumberings upon the bed;
Job|33|16|Then he openeth the ears of men,                   And sealeth their instruction,
Job|33|17|That he may withdraw man {from his} purpose,                   And hide pride from man;
Job|33|18|He keepeth back his soul from the pit,                   And his life from perishing by the sword.
Job|33|19|He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,                   And with continual strife in his bones;
Job|33|20|So that his life abhorreth bread,                   And his soul dainty food.
Job|33|21|His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;                   And his bones that were not seen stick out.
Job|33|22|Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit,                   And his life to the destroyers.
Job|33|23|If there be with him an angel,                   An interpreter, one among a thousand,                   To show unto man what is right for him;
Job|33|24|Then {God} is gracious unto him, and saith,                   Deliver him from going down to the pit,                   I have found a ransom.
Job|33|25|His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s;                   He returneth to the days of his youth.
Job|33|26|He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him,                   So that he seeth his face with joy:                   And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.
Job|33|27|He singeth before men, and saith,                   I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,                   And it profited me not:
Job|33|28|He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit,                   And my life shall behold the light.
Job|33|29|Lo, all these things doth God work,                   Twice, {yea} thrice, with a man,
Job|33|30|To bring back his soul from the pit,                   That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job|33|31|Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me:                   Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
Job|33|32|If thou hast anything to say, answer me:                   Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
Job|33|33|If not, hearken thou unto me:                   Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
Job|34|1|Moreover Elihu answered and said,
Job|34|2|Hear my words, ye wise men;                   And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
Job|34|3|For the ear trieth words,                   As the palate tasteth food.
Job|34|4|Let us choose for us that which is right:                   Let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job|34|5|For Job hath said, I am righteous,                   And God hath taken away my right:
Job|34|6|Notwithstanding my right I am {accounted} a liar;                   My wound is incurable, {though I am} without transgression.
Job|34|7|What man is like Job,                   Who drinketh up scoffing like water,
Job|34|8|Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,                   And walketh with wicked men?
Job|34|9|For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing                   That he should delight himself with God.
Job|34|10|Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:                   Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,                   And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
Job|34|11|For the work of a man will he render unto him,                   And cause every man to find according to his ways.
Job|34|12|Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,                   Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
Job|34|13|Who gave him a charge over the earth?                   Or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job|34|14|If he set his heart upon himself,                           {If} he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job|34|15|All flesh shall perish together,                   And man shall turn again unto dust.
Job|34|16|If now {thou hast} understanding, hear this:                   Hearken to the voice of my words.
Job|34|17|Shall even one that hateth justice govern?                   And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous {and} mighty?-
Job|34|18|{Him} that saith to a king, {Thou art} vile,                           {Or} to nobles, {Ye are} wicked;
Job|34|19|That respecteth not the persons of princes,                   Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;                   For they all are the work of his hands.
Job|34|20|In a moment they die, even at midnight;                   The people are shaken and pass away,                   And the mighty are taken away without hand.
Job|34|21|For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,                   And he seeth all his goings.
Job|34|22|There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,                   Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job|34|23|For he needeth not further to consider a man,                   That he should go before God in judgment.
Job|34|24|He breaketh in pieces mighty men {in ways} past finding out,                   And setteth others in their stead.
Job|34|25|Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;                   And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job|34|26|He striketh them as wicked men                   In the open sight of others;
Job|34|27|Because they turned aside from following him,                   And would not have regard in any of his ways:
Job|34|28|So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,                   And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
Job|34|29|When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?                   And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?                   Alike whether {it be done} unto a nation, or unto a man:
Job|34|30|That the godless man reign not,                   That there be none to ensnare the people.
Job|34|31|For hath any said unto God,                   I have borne {chastisement}, I will not offend {any more}:
Job|34|32|That which I see not teach thou me:                   If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
Job|34|33|Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?                   For thou must choose, and not I:                   Therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job|34|34|Men of understanding will say unto me,                   Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
Job|34|35|Job speaketh without knowledge,                   And his words are without wisdom.
Job|34|36|Would that Job were tried unto the end,                   Because of his answering like wicked men.
Job|34|37|For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;                   He clappeth his hands among us,                   And multiplieth his words against God.
Job|35|1|Moreover Elihu answered and said,
Job|35|2|Thinkest thou this to be {thy} right,                           {Or} sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,
Job|35|3|That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?                           {And}, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
Job|35|4|I will answer thee,                   And thy companions with thee.
Job|35|5|Look unto the heavens, and see;                   And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
Job|35|6|If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him?                   And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job|35|7|If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?                   Or what receiveth he of thy hand?
Job|35|8|Thy wickedness {may hurt} a man as thou art;                   And thy righteousness {may profit} a son of man.
Job|35|9|By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;                   They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job|35|10|But none saith, Where is God my Maker,                   Who giveth songs in the night,
Job|35|11|Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,                   And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
Job|35|12|There they cry, but none giveth answer,                   Because of the pride of evil men.
Job|35|13|Surely God will not hear an empty {cry},                   Neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job|35|14|How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not,                   The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
Job|35|15|But now, because he hath not visited in his anger,                   Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
Job|35|16|Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity;                   He multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job|36|1|Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job|36|2|Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;                   For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf.
Job|36|3|I will fetch my knowledge from afar,                   And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
Job|36|4|For truly my words are not false:                   One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
Job|36|5|Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any:                   He is mighty in strength of understanding.
Job|36|6|He preserveth not the life of the wicked,                   But giveth to the afflicted {their} right.
Job|36|7|He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:                   But with kings upon the throne                   He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
Job|36|8|And if they be bound in fetters,                   And be taken in the cords of afflictions;
Job|36|9|Then he showeth them their work,                   And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
Job|36|10|He openeth also their ear to instruction,                   And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
Job|36|11|If they hearken and serve {him},                   They shall spend their days in prosperity,                   And their years in pleasures.
Job|36|12|But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,                   And they shall die without knowledge.
Job|36|13|But they that are godless in heart lay up anger:                   They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
Job|36|14|They die in youth,                   And their life {perisheth} among the unclean.
Job|36|15|He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction,                   And openeth their ear in oppression.
Job|36|16|Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress                   Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;                   And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.
Job|36|17|But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked:                   Judgment and justice take hold {on thee}.
Job|36|18|For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements;                   Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
Job|36|19|Will thy cry avail, {that thou be} not in distress,                   Or all the forces of {thy} strength?
Job|36|20|Desire not the night,                   When peoples are cut off in their place.
Job|36|21|Take heed, regard not iniquity:                   For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
Job|36|22|Behold, God doeth loftily in his power:                   Who is a teacher like unto him?
Job|36|23|Who hath enjoined him his way?                   Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
Job|36|24|Remember that thou magnify his work,                   Whereof men have sung.
Job|36|25|All men have looked thereon;                   Man beholdeth it afar off.
Job|36|26|Behold, God is great, and we know him not;                   The number of his years is unsearchable.
Job|36|27|For he draweth up the drops of water,                   Which distil in rain from his vapor,
Job|36|28|Which the skies pour down                   And drop upon man abundantly.
Job|36|29|Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,                   The thunderings of his pavilion?
Job|36|30|Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;                   And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
Job|36|31|For by these he judgeth the peoples;                   He giveth food in abundance.
Job|36|32|He covereth his hands with the lightning,                   And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
Job|36|33|The noise thereof telleth concerning him,                   The cattle also concerning {the storm} that cometh up.
Job|37|1|Yea, at this my heart trembleth,                   And is moved out of its place.
Job|37|2|Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,                   And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
Job|37|3|He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,                   And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.
Job|37|4|After it a voice roareth;                   He thundereth with the voice of his majesty;                   And he restraineth not {the lightnings} when his voice is heard.
Job|37|5|God thundereth marvellously with his voice;                   Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
Job|37|6|For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth;                   Likewise to the shower of rain,                   And to the showers of his mighty rain.
Job|37|7|He sealeth up the hand of every man,                   That all men whom he hath made may know {it}.
Job|37|8|Then the beasts go into coverts,                   And remain in their dens.
Job|37|9|Out of the chamber {of the south} cometh the storm,                   And cold out of the north.
Job|37|10|By the breath of God ice is given;                   And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job|37|11|Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;                   He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
Job|37|12|And it is turned round about by his guidance,                   That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them                   Upon the face of the habitable world,
Job|37|13|Whether it be for correction, or for his land,                   Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
Job|37|14|Hearken unto this, O Job:                   Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job|37|15|Dost thou know how God layeth {his charge} upon them,                   And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
Job|37|16|Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,                   The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
Job|37|17|How thy garments are warm,                   When the earth is still by reason of the south {wind}?
Job|37|18|Canst thou with him spread out the sky,                   Which is strong as a molten mirror?
Job|37|19|Teach us what we shall say unto him;                           {For} we cannot set {our speech} in order by reason of darkness.
Job|37|20|Shall it be told him that I would speak?                   Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job|37|21|And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;                   But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
Job|37|22|Out of the north cometh golden splendor:                   God hath upon him terrible majesty.
Job|37|23|{Touching} the Almighty, we cannot find him out                   He is excellent in power;                   And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
Job|37|24|Men do therefore fear him:                   He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
Job|38|1|Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job|38|2|Who is this that darkeneth counsel                   By words without knowledge?
Job|38|3|Gird up now thy loins like a man;                   For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job|38|4|Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?                   Declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job|38|5|Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?                   Or who stretched the line upon it?
Job|38|6|Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?                   Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,
Job|38|7|When the morning stars sang together,                   And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job|38|8|Or {who} shut up the sea with doors,                   When it brake forth, {as if} it had issued out of the womb;
Job|38|9|When I made clouds the garment thereof,                   And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,
Job|38|10|And marked out for it my bound,                   And set bars and doors,
Job|38|11|And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;                   And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
Job|38|12|Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days {began},                           {And} caused the dayspring to know its place;
Job|38|13|That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,                   And the wicked be shaken out of it?
Job|38|14|It is changed as clay under the seal;                   And {all things} stand forth as a garment:
Job|38|15|And from the wicked their light is withholden,                   And the high arm is broken.
Job|38|16|Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?                   Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job|38|17|Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?                   Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job|38|18|Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth?                   Declare, if thou knowest it all.
Job|38|19|Where is the way to the dwelling of light?                   And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
Job|38|20|That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,                   And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?
Job|38|21|{Doubtless}, thou knowest, for thou wast then born,                   And the number of thy days is great!
Job|38|22|Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,                   Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
Job|38|23|Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,                   Against the day of battle and war?
Job|38|24|By what way is the light parted,                   Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
Job|38|25|Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood,                   Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;
Job|38|26|To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;                   On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
Job|38|27|To satisfy the waste and desolate {ground},                   And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
Job|38|28|Hath the rain a father?                   Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job|38|29|Out of whose womb came the ice?                   And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
Job|38|30|The waters hide themselves {and become} like stone,                   And the face of the deep is frozen.
Job|38|31|Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades,                   Or loose the bands of Orion?
Job|38|32|Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?                   Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?
Job|38|33|Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?                   Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job|38|34|Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,                   That abundance of waters may cover thee?
Job|38|35|Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go,                   And say unto thee, Here we are?
Job|38|36|Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?                   Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
Job|38|37|Who can number the clouds by wisdom?                   Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
Job|38|38|When the dust runneth into a mass,                   And the clods cleave fast together?
Job|38|39|Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness,                   Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
Job|38|40|When they couch in their dens,                           {And} abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Job|38|41|Who provideth for the raven his prey,                   When his young ones cry unto God,                           {And} wander for lack of food?
Job|39|1|Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?                           {Or} canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job|39|2|Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?                   Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job|39|3|They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,                   They cast out their pains.
Job|39|4|Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;                   They go forth, and return not again.
Job|39|5|Who hath sent out the wild ass free?                   Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
Job|39|6|Whose home I have made the wilderness,                   And the salt land his dwelling-place?
Job|39|7|He scorneth the tumult of the city,                   Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
Job|39|8|The range of the mountains is his pasture,                   And he searcheth after every green thing.
Job|39|9|Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee?                   Or will he abide by thy crib?
Job|39|10|Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?                   Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Job|39|11|Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?                   Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
Job|39|12|Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed,                   And gather {the grain} of thy threshing-floor?
Job|39|13|The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;                           {But} are they the pinions and plumage of love?
Job|39|14|For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,                   And warmeth them in the dust,
Job|39|15|And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,                   Or that the wild beast may trample them.
Job|39|16|She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers:                   Though her labor be in vain, {she is} without fear;
Job|39|17|Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,                   Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
Job|39|18|What time she lifteth up herself on high,                   She scorneth the horse and his rider.
Job|39|19|Hast thou given the horse {his} might?                   Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
Job|39|20|Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?                   The glory of his snorting is terrible.
Job|39|21|He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:                   He goeth out to meet the armed men.
Job|39|22|He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed;                   Neither turneth he back from the sword.
Job|39|23|The quiver rattleth against him,                   The flashing spear and the javelin.
Job|39|24|He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage;                   Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
Job|39|25|As oft as the trumpet {soundeth} he saith, Aha!                   And he smelleth the battle afar off,                   The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
Job|39|26|Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth,                   (And) stretcheth her wings toward the south?
Job|39|27|Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up,                   And maketh her nest on high?
Job|39|28|On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home,                   Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.
Job|39|29|From thence she spieth out the prey;                   Her eyes behold it afar off.
Job|39|30|Her young ones also suck up blood:                   And where the slain are, there is she.
Job|40|1|Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,
Job|40|2|Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty?                   He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
Job|40|3|Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
Job|40|4|Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee?                   I lay my hand upon my mouth.
Job|40|5|Once have I spoken, and I will not answer;                   Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
Job|40|6|Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job|40|7|Gird up thy loins now like a man:                   I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job|40|8|Wilt thou even annul my judgment?                   Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?
Job|40|9|Or hast thou an arm like God?                   And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
Job|40|10|Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity;                   And array thyself with honor and majesty.
Job|40|11|Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger;                   And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
Job|40|12|Look on every one that is proud, {and} bring him low;                   And tread down the wicked where they stand.
Job|40|13|Hide them in the dust together;                   Bind their faces in the hidden {place}.
Job|40|14|Then will I also confess of thee                   That thine own right hand can save thee.
Job|40|15|Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee;                   He eateth grass as an ox.
Job|40|16|Lo now, his strength is in his loins,                   And his force is in the muscles of his belly.
Job|40|17|He moveth his tail like a cedar:                   The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
Job|40|18|His bones are {as} tubes of brass;                   His limbs are like bars of iron.
Job|40|19|He is the chief of the ways of God:                   He {only} that made him giveth him his sword.
Job|40|20|Surely the mountains bring him forth food,                   Where all the beasts of the field do play.
Job|40|21|He lieth under the lotus-trees,                   In the covert of the reed, and the fen.
Job|40|22|The lotus-trees cover him with their shade;                   The willows of the brook compass him about.
Job|40|23|Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;                   He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.
Job|40|24|Shall any take him when he is on the watch,                   Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
Job|41|1|Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook?                   Or press down his tongue with a cord?
Job|41|2|Canst thou put a rope into his nose?                   Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
Job|41|3|Will he make many supplications unto thee?                   Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
Job|41|4|Will he make a covenant with thee,                   That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
Job|41|5|Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?                   Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Job|41|6|Will the bands {of fishermen} make traffic of him?                   Will they part him among the merchants?
Job|41|7|Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons,                   Or his head with fish-spears?
Job|41|8|Lay thy hand upon him;                   Remember the battle, and do so no more.
Job|41|9|Behold, the hope of him is in vain:                   Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
Job|41|10|None is so fierce that he dare stir him up;                   Who then is he that can stand before me?
Job|41|11|Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?                           {Whatsoever is} under the whole heaven is mine.
Job|41|12|I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,                   Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
Job|41|13|Who can strip off his outer garment?                   Who shall come within his jaws?
Job|41|14|Who can open the doors of his face?                   Round about his teeth is terror.
Job|41|15|{His} strong scales are {his} pride,                   Shut up together {as with} a close seal.
Job|41|16|One is so near to another,                   That no air can come between them.
Job|41|17|They are joined one to another;                   They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.
Job|41|18|His sneezings flash forth light,                   And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
Job|41|19|Out of his mouth go burning torches,                   And sparks of fire leap forth.
Job|41|20|Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth,                   As of a boiling pot and {burning} rushes.
Job|41|21|His breath kindleth coals,                   And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
Job|41|22|In his neck abideth strength,                   And terror danceth before him.
Job|41|23|The flakes of his flesh are joined together:                   They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
Job|41|24|His heart is as firm as a stone;                   Yea, firm as the nether millstone.
Job|41|25|When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid:                   By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.
Job|41|26|If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail;                   Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
Job|41|27|He counteth iron as straw,                           {And} brass as rotten wood.
Job|41|28|The arrow cannot make him flee:                   Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
Job|41|29|Clubs are counted as stubble:                   He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
Job|41|30|His underparts are {like} sharp potsherds:                   He spreadeth {as it were} a threshing-wain upon the mire.
Job|41|31|He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:                   He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
Job|41|32|He maketh a path to shine after him;                   One would think the deep to be hoary.
Job|41|33|Upon earth there is not his like,                   That is made without fear.
Job|41|34|He beholdeth everything that is high:                   He is king over all the sons of pride.
Job|42|1|Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,
Job|42|2|I know that thou canst do all things,                   And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.
Job|42|3|Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?                   Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not,                   Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
Job|42|4|Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak;                   I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job|42|5|I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;                   But now mine eye seeth thee:
Job|42|6|Wherefore I abhor {myself},                   And repent in dust and ashes.
Job|42|7|And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
Job|42|8|Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
Job|42|9|So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.
Job|42|10|And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Job|42|11|Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.
Job|42|12|So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
Job|42|13|He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job|42|14|And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
Job|42|15|And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
Job|42|16|And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, {even} four generations.
Job|42|17|So Job died, being old and full of days.
Ezra|1|1|Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying,
Ezra|1|2|Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Ezra|1|3|Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|4|And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|5|Then rose up the heads of fathers’ {houses} of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|6|And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
Ezra|1|7|Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;
Ezra|1|8|even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
Ezra|1|9|And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,
Ezra|1|10|thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
Ezra|1|11|All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
Ezra|2|1|Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;
Ezra|2|2|who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
Ezra|2|3|The children of Parosh, two thousand a hundred seventy and two.
Ezra|2|4|The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.
Ezra|2|5|The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five.

Ezra|2|33|The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five.
Ezra|2|34|The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.
Ezra|2|35|The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and thirty.
Ezra|2|36|The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three.
Ezra|2|37|The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.
Ezra|2|38|The children of Pashhur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.
Ezra|2|39|The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.
Ezra|2|40|The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.
Ezra|2|41|The singers: the children of Asaph, a hundred twenty and eight.
Ezra|2|42|The children of the porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all a hundred thirty and nine.
Ezra|2|43|The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
Ezra|2|44|the children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon,
Ezra|2|45|the children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub,
Ezra|2|46|the children of Hagab, the children of Shamlai, the children of Hanan,
Ezra|2|47|the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah,
Ezra|2|48|the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam,
Ezra|2|49|the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,
Ezra|2|50|the children of Asnah, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephisim,
Ezra|2|51|the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
Ezra|2|52|the children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
Ezra|2|53|the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,
Ezra|2|54|the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
Ezra|2|55|The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Hassophereth, the children of Peruda,
Ezra|2|56|the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
Ezra|2|57|the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami.
Ezra|2|58|All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
Ezra|2|59|And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, {and} Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
Ezra|2|60|the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
Ezra|2|61|And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
Ezra|2|62|These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
Ezra|2|63|And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
Ezra|2|64|The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
Ezra|2|65|besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
Ezra|2|66|Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
Ezra|2|67|their camels, four hundred thirty and five; {their} asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
Ezra|2|68|And some of the heads of fathers’ {houses}, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place:
Ezra|2|69|they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.
Ezra|2|70|So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
Ezra|3|1|And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
Ezra|3|2|Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
Ezra|3|3|And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.
Ezra|3|4|And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and {offered} the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;
Ezra|3|5|and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and {the offerings} of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|3|6|From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.
Ezra|3|7|They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
Ezra|3|8|Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|3|9|Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
Ezra|3|10|And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.
Ezra|3|11|And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, {saying}, For he is good, for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
Ezra|3|12|But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ {houses}, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
Ezra|3|13|so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
Ezra|4|1|Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;
Ezra|4|2|then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ {houses}, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.
Ezra|4|3|But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ {houses} of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
Ezra|4|4|Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
Ezra|4|5|and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra|4|6|And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra|4|7|And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian {character}, and set forth in the Syrian {tongue}.
Ezra|4|8|Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
Ezra|4|9|then {wrote} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,
Ezra|4|10|and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest {of the country} beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|11|This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|12|Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.
Ezra|4|13|Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.
Ezra|4|14|Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
Ezra|4|15|that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.
Ezra|4|16|We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.
Ezra|4|17|{Then} sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and in the rest {of the country} beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.
Ezra|4|18|The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
Ezra|4|19|And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
Ezra|4|20|There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all {the country} beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.
Ezra|4|21|Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.
Ezra|4|22|And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra|4|23|Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
Ezra|4|24|Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra|5|1|Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel {prophesied they} unto them.
Ezra|5|2|Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
Ezra|5|3|At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|4|Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.
Ezra|5|5|But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.
Ezra|5|6|The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;
Ezra|5|7|they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.
Ezra|5|8|Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.
Ezra|5|9|Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|10|We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.
Ezra|5|11|And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.
Ezra|5|12|But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
Ezra|5|13|But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.
Ezra|5|14|And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
Ezra|5|15|and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.
Ezra|5|16|Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.
Ezra|5|17|Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
Ezra|6|1|Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
Ezra|6|2|And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:
Ezra|6|3|In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
Ezra|6|4|with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.
Ezra|6|5|And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God.
Ezra|6|6|Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:
Ezra|6|7|let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
Ezra|6|8|Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered.
Ezra|6|9|And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt-offerings to the God of heaven; {also} wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;
Ezra|6|10|that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
Ezra|6|11|Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:
Ezra|6|12|and the God that hath caused his name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter {the same}, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.
Ezra|6|13|Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.
Ezra|6|14|And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
Ezra|6|15|And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
Ezra|6|16|And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
Ezra|6|17|And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Ezra|6|18|And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
Ezra|6|19|And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth {day} of the first month.
Ezra|6|20|For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
Ezra|6|21|And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,
Ezra|6|22|and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
Ezra|7|1|Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
Ezra|7|2|the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
Ezra|7|3|the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
Ezra|7|4|the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
Ezra|7|5|the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;
Ezra|7|6|this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.
Ezra|7|7|And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
Ezra|7|8|And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
Ezra|7|9|For upon the first {day} of the first month began he to go up from Babylon; and on the first {day} of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
Ezra|7|10|For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.
Ezra|7|11|Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:
Ezra|7|12|Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.
Ezra|7|13|I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
Ezra|7|14|Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,
Ezra|7|15|and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
Ezra|7|16|and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|17|therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|18|And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.
Ezra|7|19|And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|20|And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure-house.
Ezra|7|21|And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,
Ezra|7|22|unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
Ezra|7|23|Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
Ezra|7|24|Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.
Ezra|7|25|And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.
Ezra|7|26|And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
Ezra|7|27|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|28|and hath extended lovingkindness unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
Ezra|8|1|Now these are the heads of their fathers’ {houses}, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king:
Ezra|8|2|Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hattush.
Ezra|8|3|Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
Ezra|8|4|Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred males.
Ezra|8|5|Of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males.
Ezra|8|6|And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.
Ezra|8|7|And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males.
Ezra|8|8|And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males.
Ezra|8|9|Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
Ezra|8|10|And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a hundred and threescore males.
Ezra|8|11|And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males.
Ezra|8|12|And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males.
Ezra|8|13|And of the sons of Adonikam, {that were} the last; and these are their names: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males.
Ezra|8|14|And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.
Ezra|8|15|And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
Ezra|8|16|Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.
Ezra|8|17|And I sent them forth unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, {and} his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra|8|18|And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
Ezra|8|19|and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
Ezra|8|20|and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.
Ezra|8|21|Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
Ezra|8|22|For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
Ezra|8|23|So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
Ezra|8|24|Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
Ezra|8|25|and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:
Ezra|8|26|I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;
Ezra|8|27|and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.
Ezra|8|28|And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.
Ezra|8|29|Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’ {houses} of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|8|30|So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
Ezra|8|31|Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth {day} of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.
Ezra|8|32|And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
Ezra|8|33|And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;
Ezra|8|34|the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra|8|35|The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|8|36|And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River: and they furthered the people and the house of God.
Ezra|9|1|Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, {doing} according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
Ezra|9|2|For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
Ezra|9|3|And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
Ezra|9|4|Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.
Ezra|9|5|And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;
Ezra|9|6|and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.
Ezra|9|7|Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
Ezra|9|8|And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
Ezra|9|9|For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
Ezra|9|10|And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
Ezra|9|11|which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:
Ezra|9|12|now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
Ezra|9|13|And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,
Ezra|9|14|shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
Ezra|9|15|O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before thee because of this.
Ezra|10|1|Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
Ezra|10|2|And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
Ezra|10|3|Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
Ezra|10|4|Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
Ezra|10|5|Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.
Ezra|10|6|Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and {when} he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.
Ezra|10|7|And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
Ezra|10|8|and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
Ezra|10|9|Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth {day} of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
Ezra|10|10|And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.
Ezra|10|11|Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
Ezra|10|12|Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.
Ezra|10|13|But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
Ezra|10|14|Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
Ezra|10|15|Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this {matter}: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
Ezra|10|16|And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, {with} certain heads of fathers’ {houses}, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
Ezra|10|17|And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
Ezra|10|18|And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: {namely}, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
Ezra|10|19|And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, {they offered} a ram of the flock for their guilt.
Ezra|10|20|And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
Ezra|10|21|And of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
Ezra|10|22|And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
Ezra|10|23|And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
Ezra|10|24|And of the singers: Eliashib. And of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
Ezra|10|25|And of Israel: Of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
Ezra|10|26|And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.
Ezra|10|27|And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
Ezra|10|28|And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.
Ezra|10|29|And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, Jeremoth.
Ezra|10|30|And of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
Ezra|10|31|And {of} the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
Ezra|10|32|Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah.
Ezra|10|33|Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei.
Ezra|10|34|Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
Ezra|10|35|Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,
Ezra|10|36|Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
Ezra|10|37|Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu,
Ezra|10|38|and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,
Ezra|10|39|and Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,
Ezra|10|40|Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
Ezra|10|41|Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,
Ezra|10|42|Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.
Ezra|10|43|Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.
Ezra|10|44|All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
Leviticus|1|1|And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus|1|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, {even} of the herd and of the flock.
Leviticus|1|3|If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|4|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Leviticus|1|5|And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|1|6|And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus|1|7|And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;
Leviticus|1|8|and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|9|but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|10|And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.
Leviticus|1|11|And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|1|12|And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|13|but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|14|And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.
Leviticus|1|15|And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;
Leviticus|1|16|and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:
Leviticus|1|17|and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, {but} shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|1|And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
Leviticus|2|2|and he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn {it as} the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah:
Leviticus|2|3|and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus|2|4|And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
Leviticus|2|5|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
Leviticus|2|6|Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus|2|7|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
Leviticus|2|8|And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.
Leviticus|2|9|And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|10|And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus|2|11|No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|12|As an oblation of first-{fruits} ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
Leviticus|2|13|And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.
Leviticus|2|14|And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
Leviticus|2|15|And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus|2|16|And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|1|And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|2|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|3|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|4|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|5|And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|6|And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
Leviticus|3|7|If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;
Leviticus|3|8|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|9|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|10|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|11|And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|12|And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:
Leviticus|3|13|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|14|And he shall offer thereof his oblation, {even} an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|15|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|16|And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|3|17|It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
Leviticus|4|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|4|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:
Leviticus|4|3|if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|4|And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|5|And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|6|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|4|7|And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|8|And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|4|9|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,
Leviticus|4|10|as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|11|And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,
Leviticus|4|12|even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
Leviticus|4|13|And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
Leviticus|4|14|when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|15|And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|16|And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|17|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.
Leviticus|4|18|And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|19|And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.
Leviticus|4|20|Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|21|And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.
Leviticus|4|22|When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;
Leviticus|4|23|if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.
Leviticus|4|24|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|25|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|26|And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|27|And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;
Leviticus|4|28|if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
Leviticus|4|29|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|30|And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus|4|31|And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|32|And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
Leviticus|4|33|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|34|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:
Leviticus|4|35|and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|1|And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter {it}, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|2|Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|3|Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|4|Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these {things}.
Leviticus|5|5|And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these {things}, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:
Leviticus|5|6|and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.
Leviticus|5|7|And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|5|8|And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
Leviticus|5|9|and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|10|And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|11|But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|12|And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|13|And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and {the remnant} shall be the priest’s, as the meal-offering.
Leviticus|5|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|5|15|If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
Leviticus|5|16|and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|17|And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|18|And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|19|It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|2|If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,
Leviticus|6|3|or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;
Leviticus|6|4|then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,
Leviticus|6|5|or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.
Leviticus|6|6|And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:
Leviticus|6|7|and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.
Leviticus|6|8|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|9|Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.
Leviticus|6|10|And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
Leviticus|6|11|And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
Leviticus|6|12|And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|6|13|Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
Leviticus|6|14|And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar.
Leviticus|6|15|And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|16|And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus|6|17|It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
Leviticus|6|18|Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as {his} portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy.
Leviticus|6|19|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|20|This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.
Leviticus|6|21|On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|22|And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|23|And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|6|24|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|25|Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy.
Leviticus|6|26|The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|6|27|Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.
Leviticus|6|28|But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
Leviticus|6|29|Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
Leviticus|6|30|And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|7|1|And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.
Leviticus|7|2|In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|7|3|And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
Leviticus|7|4|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;
Leviticus|7|5|and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering.
Leviticus|7|6|Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.
Leviticus|7|7|As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it.
Leviticus|7|8|And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.
Leviticus|7|9|And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.
Leviticus|7|10|And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.
Leviticus|7|11|And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|7|12|If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.
Leviticus|7|13|With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.
Leviticus|7|14|And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|7|15|And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Leviticus|7|16|But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:
Leviticus|7|17|but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|7|18|And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|7|19|And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:
Leviticus|7|20|but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|21|And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|22|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|7|23|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.
Leviticus|7|24|And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
Leviticus|7|25|For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|26|And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
Leviticus|7|27|Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|28|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|7|29|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:
Leviticus|7|30|his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|7|31|And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
Leviticus|7|32|And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
Leviticus|7|33|He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.
Leviticus|7|34|For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as {their} portion for ever from the children of Israel.
Leviticus|7|35|This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priest’s office;
Leviticus|7|36|which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is {their} portion for ever throughout their generations.
Leviticus|7|37|This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;
Leviticus|7|38|which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|8|2|Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
Leviticus|8|3|and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|8|4|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|8|5|And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done.
Leviticus|8|6|And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
Leviticus|8|7|And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
Leviticus|8|8|And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.
Leviticus|8|9|And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|8|10|And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
Leviticus|8|11|And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
Leviticus|8|12|And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
Leviticus|8|13|And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|8|14|And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
Leviticus|8|15|And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
Leviticus|8|16|And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.
Leviticus|8|17|But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|8|18|And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus|8|19|And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|8|20|And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
Leviticus|8|21|And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|8|22|And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus|8|23|And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|8|24|And he brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|8|25|And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:
Leviticus|8|26|and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:
Leviticus|8|27|and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|8|28|And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|8|29|And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|8|30|And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.
Leviticus|8|31|And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus|8|32|And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus|8|33|And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
Leviticus|8|34|As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
Leviticus|8|35|And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus|8|36|And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses.
Leviticus|9|1|And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus|9|2|and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.
Leviticus|9|3|And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus|9|4|and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.
Leviticus|9|5|And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.
Leviticus|9|6|And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.
Leviticus|9|7|And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded.
Leviticus|9|8|So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
Leviticus|9|9|And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
Leviticus|9|10|but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|9|11|And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus|9|12|And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|9|13|And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
Leviticus|9|14|And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
Leviticus|9|15|And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
Leviticus|9|16|And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus|9|17|And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
Leviticus|9|18|He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
Leviticus|9|19|and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth {the inwards}, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:
Leviticus|9|20|and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Leviticus|9|21|and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.
Leviticus|9|22|And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|9|23|And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.
Leviticus|9|24|And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
Leviticus|10|1|And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus|10|2|And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
Leviticus|10|3|Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus|10|4|And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus|10|5|So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus|10|6|And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.
Leviticus|10|7|And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus|10|8|And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|10|9|Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
Leviticus|10|10|and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus|10|11|and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.
Leviticus|10|12|And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;
Leviticus|10|13|and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus|10|14|And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
Leviticus|10|15|The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.
Leviticus|10|16|And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
Leviticus|10|17|Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|18|Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Leviticus|10|19|And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|20|And when Moses heard {that}, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
Leviticus|11|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus|11|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus|11|3|Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, {and} cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|4|Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|5|And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|6|And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|7|And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|8|Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|9|These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|10|And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
Leviticus|11|11|and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
Leviticus|11|12|Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|13|And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Leviticus|11|14|and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,
Leviticus|11|15|every raven after its kind,
Leviticus|11|16|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,
Leviticus|11|17|and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
Leviticus|11|18|and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,
Leviticus|11|19|and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus|11|20|All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|21|Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|22|Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
Leviticus|11|23|But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|24|And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;
Leviticus|11|25|And whosoever beareth {aught} of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|26|Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|27|And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|28|And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|29|And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,
Leviticus|11|30|and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus|11|31|These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|32|And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.
Leviticus|11|33|And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.
Leviticus|11|34|All food {therein} which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every {such} vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|35|And every thing whereupon {any part} of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|36|Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|37|And if {aught} of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus|11|38|But if water be put upon the seed, and {aught} of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|39|And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|40|And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|41|And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|11|42|Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
Leviticus|11|43|Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
Leviticus|11|44|For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|45|For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
Leviticus|11|46|This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
Leviticus|11|47|to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.
Leviticus|12|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|12|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.
Leviticus|12|3|And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus|12|4|And she shall continue in the blood of {her} purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
Leviticus|12|5|But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of {her} purifying threescore and six days.
Leviticus|12|6|And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:
Leviticus|12|7|and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus|12|8|And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
Leviticus|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|13|2|When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
Leviticus|13|3|and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus|13|4|And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|5|and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|6|and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|7|But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:
Leviticus|13|8|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus|13|9|When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
Leviticus|13|10|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,
Leviticus|13|11|it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|12|And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of {him that hath} the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;
Leviticus|13|13|then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
Leviticus|13|14|But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus|13|15|And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus|13|16|Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;
Leviticus|13|17|and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: he is clean.
Leviticus|13|18|And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,
Leviticus|13|19|and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;
Leviticus|13|20|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.
Leviticus|13|21|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|22|And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
Leviticus|13|23|But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus|13|24|Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick {flesh} of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;
Leviticus|13|25|then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|26|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|27|and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|28|And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.
Leviticus|13|29|And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,
Leviticus|13|30|then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus|13|31|And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague of the scall seven days:
Leviticus|13|32|And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,
Leviticus|13|33|then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the scall seven days more:
Leviticus|13|34|and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|35|But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,
Leviticus|13|36|then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|37|But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus|13|38|And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
Leviticus|13|39|then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.
Leviticus|13|40|And if a man’s hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; {yet} is he clean.
Leviticus|13|41|And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; {yet} is he clean.
Leviticus|13|42|But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
Leviticus|13|43|Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;
Leviticus|13|44|he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.
Leviticus|13|45|And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
Leviticus|13|46|All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.
Leviticus|13|47|The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
Leviticus|13|48|whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;
Leviticus|13|49|if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.
Leviticus|13|50|And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up {that which hath} the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|51|and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus|13|52|And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
Leviticus|13|53|And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;
Leviticus|13|54|then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|55|and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
Leviticus|13|56|And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
Leviticus|13|57|and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
Leviticus|13|58|And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
Leviticus|13|59|This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
Leviticus|14|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|14|2|This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus|14|3|and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,
Leviticus|14|4|then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|5|And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
Leviticus|14|6|As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
Leviticus|14|7|And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.
Leviticus|14|8|And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.
Leviticus|14|9|And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|10|And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
Leviticus|14|11|And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|14|12|And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|13|and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:
Leviticus|14|14|and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|15|And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|16|and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|17|and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|18|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|19|And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;
Leviticus|14|20|and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|21|And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;
Leviticus|14|22|and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|14|23|And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|24|and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|25|And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|26|And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|27|and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|28|and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|29|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|30|And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,
Leviticus|14|31|even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|32|This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get {that which pertaineth} to his cleansing.
Leviticus|14|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|14|34|When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
Leviticus|14|35|then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.
Leviticus|14|36|And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
Leviticus|14|37|and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;
Leviticus|14|38|then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
Leviticus|14|39|And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
Leviticus|14|40|then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:
Leviticus|14|41|and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:
Leviticus|14|42|and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
Leviticus|14|43|And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
Leviticus|14|44|then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
Leviticus|14|45|And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
Leviticus|14|46|Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|14|47|And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus|14|48|And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
Leviticus|14|49|And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|50|and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus|14|51|and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
Leviticus|14|52|and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
Leviticus|14|53|but he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.
Leviticus|14|54|This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,
Leviticus|14|55|and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
Leviticus|14|56|and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
Leviticus|14|57|to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus|15|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|15|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
Leviticus|15|3|And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.
Leviticus|15|4|Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|5|And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|6|And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|7|And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|8|And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|9|And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|10|And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|11|And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|12|And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
Leviticus|15|13|And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|14|And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:
Leviticus|15|15|and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue.
Leviticus|15|16|And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|17|And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|18|The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|19|And if a woman have an issue, {and} her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|20|And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|21|And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|22|And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|23|And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|24|And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|25|And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.
Leviticus|15|26|Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.
Leviticus|15|27|And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|28|But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|29|And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|15|30|And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness.
Leviticus|15|31|Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.
Leviticus|15|32|This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;
Leviticus|15|33|and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
Leviticus|16|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;
Leviticus|16|2|and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
Leviticus|16|3|Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|16|4|He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
Leviticus|16|5|And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|16|6|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
Leviticus|16|7|And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|16|8|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.
Leviticus|16|9|And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|16|10|But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.
Leviticus|16|11|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:
Leviticus|16|12|and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:
Leviticus|16|13|and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
Leviticus|16|14|and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus|16|15|Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
Leviticus|16|16|and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
Leviticus|16|17|And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
Leviticus|16|18|And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
Leviticus|16|19|And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
Leviticus|16|20|And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:
Leviticus|16|21|and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:
Leviticus|16|22|and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus|16|23|And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
Leviticus|16|24|and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus|16|25|And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
Leviticus|16|26|And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus|16|27|And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
Leviticus|16|28|And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus|16|29|And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:
Leviticus|16|30|for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.
Leviticus|16|31|It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.
Leviticus|16|32|And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:
Leviticus|16|33|and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus|16|34|And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|17|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|17|2|Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,
Leviticus|17|3|What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,
Leviticus|17|4|and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
Leviticus|17|5|To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|6|And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|7|And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.
Leviticus|17|8|And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
Leviticus|17|9|and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|17|10|And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus|17|11|For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.
Leviticus|17|12|Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
Leviticus|17|13|And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
Leviticus|17|14|For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is {all one} with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
Leviticus|17|15|And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
Leviticus|17|16|But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|18|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|18|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|3|After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
Leviticus|18|4|Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|5|Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|6|None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover {their} nakedness: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|7|The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|8|The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|9|The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
Leviticus|18|10|The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.
Leviticus|18|11|The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|12|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|13|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|14|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
Leviticus|18|15|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|16|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|17|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
Leviticus|18|18|And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival {to her}, to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time.
Leviticus|18|19|And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
Leviticus|18|20|And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor’s wife, to defile thyself with her.
Leviticus|18|21|And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through {the fire} to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|22|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
Leviticus|18|23|And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
Leviticus|18|24|Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;
Leviticus|18|25|And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.
Leviticus|18|26|Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;
Leviticus|18|27|(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);
Leviticus|18|28|that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus|18|29|For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus|18|30|Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|19|2|Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy.
Leviticus|19|3|Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|4|Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|5|And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus|19|6|It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|19|7|And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:
Leviticus|19|8|but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|19|9|And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
Leviticus|19|10|And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|11|Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
Leviticus|19|12|And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|13|Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
Leviticus|19|14|Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|15|Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
Leviticus|19|16|Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|17|Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
Leviticus|19|18|Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|19|Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
Leviticus|19|20|And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
Leviticus|19|21|And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
Leviticus|19|22|And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him.
Leviticus|19|23|And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|19|24|But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|25|And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|26|Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.
Leviticus|19|27|Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
Leviticus|19|28|Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|29|Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
Leviticus|19|30|Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|31|Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|32|Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|33|And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
Leviticus|19|34|The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|35|Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
Leviticus|19|36|Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Leviticus|19|37|And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|20|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|20|2|Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus|20|3|I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
Leviticus|20|4|And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death;
Leviticus|20|5|then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.
Leviticus|20|6|And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus|20|7|Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|20|8|And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.
Leviticus|20|9|For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
Leviticus|20|10|And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|20|11|And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|12|And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|13|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|14|And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
Leviticus|20|15|And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
Leviticus|20|16|And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|17|And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|20|18|And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus|20|19|And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
Leviticus|20|20|And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
Leviticus|20|21|And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
Leviticus|20|22|Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.
Leviticus|20|23|And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus|20|24|But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus|20|25|Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.
Leviticus|20|26|And ye shall be holy unto me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine.
Leviticus|20|27|A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|21|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;
Leviticus|21|2|except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
Leviticus|21|3|and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.
Leviticus|21|4|He shall not defile himself, {being} a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
Leviticus|21|5|They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
Leviticus|21|6|They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus|21|7|They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
Leviticus|21|8|Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.
Leviticus|21|9|And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|21|10|And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;
Leviticus|21|11|neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
Leviticus|21|12|neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|21|13|And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus|21|14|A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.
Leviticus|21|15|And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him.
Leviticus|21|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|21|17|Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus|21|18|For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,
Leviticus|21|19|or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
Leviticus|21|20|or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
Leviticus|21|21|no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus|21|22|He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:
Leviticus|21|23|only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|21|24|So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
Leviticus|22|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|2|Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|3|Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|4|What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Leviticus|22|5|or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Leviticus|22|6|the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
Leviticus|22|7|And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
Leviticus|22|8|That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|9|They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|22|10|There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|11|But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
Leviticus|22|12|And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.
Leviticus|22|13|But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
Leviticus|22|14|And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|15|And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,
Leviticus|22|16|and {so} cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|22|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|18|Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus|22|19|that ye may be accepted, {ye shall offer} a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Leviticus|22|20|But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus|22|21|And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Leviticus|22|22|Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|23|Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Leviticus|22|24|That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do {thus} in your land.
Leviticus|22|25|Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
Leviticus|22|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|27|When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|28|And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
Leviticus|22|29|And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus|22|30|On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|31|Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|32|And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,
Leviticus|22|33|who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Leviticus|23|3|Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|4|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
Leviticus|23|5|In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah’s passover.
Leviticus|23|6|And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus|23|7|In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|8|But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Leviticus|23|11|and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus|23|12|And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|13|And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
Leviticus|23|14|And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|15|And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:
Leviticus|23|16|even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|17|Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts {of an ephah}: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|18|And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|19|And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Leviticus|23|20|And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.
Leviticus|23|21|And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus|23|22|And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|24|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
Leviticus|23|25|Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|27|Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|28|And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|29|For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|23|30|And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Leviticus|23|31|Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|32|It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
Leviticus|23|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|34|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|35|On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|36|Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|37|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
Leviticus|23|38|besides the sabbaths of Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|39|Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Leviticus|23|40|And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.
Leviticus|23|41|And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus|23|42|Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
Leviticus|23|43|that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|44|And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|2|Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus|24|3|Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Leviticus|24|4|He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.
Leviticus|24|5|And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts {of an ephah} shall be in one cake.
Leviticus|24|6|And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|7|And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|8|Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus|24|9|And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Leviticus|24|10|And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:
Leviticus|24|11|and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus|24|12|And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|13|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|14|Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus|24|15|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus|24|16|And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name {of Jehovah}, shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|17|And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|24|18|And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus|24|19|And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:
Leviticus|24|20|breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
Leviticus|24|21|And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|22|Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|24|23|And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|25|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus|25|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|25|3|Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;
Leviticus|25|4|but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Leviticus|25|5|That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Leviticus|25|6|And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.
Leviticus|25|7|And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
Leviticus|25|8|And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.
Leviticus|25|9|Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus|25|10|And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Leviticus|25|11|A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather {the grapes} in it of the undressed vines.
Leviticus|25|12|For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus|25|13|In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|14|And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus|25|15|According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, {and} according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|16|According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|17|And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|25|18|Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus|25|19|And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Leviticus|25|20|And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;
Leviticus|25|21|then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
Leviticus|25|22|And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.
Leviticus|25|23|And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus|25|24|And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus|25|25|If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.
Leviticus|25|26|And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
Leviticus|25|27|then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|28|But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|29|And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.
Leviticus|25|30|And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|31|But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|32|Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Leviticus|25|33|And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Leviticus|25|34|But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus|25|35|And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: {as} a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
Leviticus|25|36|Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Leviticus|25|37|Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
Leviticus|25|38|I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, {and} to be your God.
Leviticus|25|39|And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant.
Leviticus|25|40|As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:
Leviticus|25|41|then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Leviticus|25|42|For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus|25|43|Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus|25|44|And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus|25|45|Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus|25|46|And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.
Leviticus|25|47|And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger {or} sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family;
Leviticus|25|48|after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;
Leviticus|25|49|or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus|25|50|And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
Leviticus|25|51|If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Leviticus|25|52|And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
Leviticus|25|53|As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
Leviticus|25|54|And if he be not redeemed by these {means}, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.
Leviticus|25|55|For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|26|1|Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|26|2|Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|26|3|If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus|26|4|then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Leviticus|26|5|And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
Leviticus|26|6|And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
Leviticus|26|7|And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|8|And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|9|And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
Leviticus|26|10|And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.
Leviticus|26|11|And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus|26|12|And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
Leviticus|26|13|I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
Leviticus|26|14|But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
Leviticus|26|15|and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;
Leviticus|26|16|I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus|26|17|And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
Leviticus|26|18|And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus|26|19|And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;
Leviticus|26|20|and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
Leviticus|26|21|And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus|26|22|And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
Leviticus|26|23|And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|24|then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|25|And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus|26|26|When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
Leviticus|26|27|And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|28|then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|29|And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
Leviticus|26|30|And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus|26|31|And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
Leviticus|26|32|And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus|26|33|And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Leviticus|26|34|Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus|26|35|As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
Leviticus|26|36|And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
Leviticus|26|37|And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus|26|38|And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus|26|39|And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus|26|40|And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,
Leviticus|26|41|I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
Leviticus|26|42|then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
Leviticus|26|43|The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Leviticus|26|44|And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;
Leviticus|26|45|but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|26|46|These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.
Leviticus|27|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|27|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|3|And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|27|4|And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus|27|5|And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|6|And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|7|And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|8|But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.
Leviticus|27|9|And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|10|He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|11|And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;
Leviticus|27|12|and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
Leviticus|27|13|But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|14|And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
Leviticus|27|15|And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
Leviticus|27|16|And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley {shall be valued} at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|17|If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
Leviticus|27|18|But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|19|And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
Leviticus|27|20|And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:
Leviticus|27|21|but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
Leviticus|27|22|And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;
Leviticus|27|23|then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|24|In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.
Leviticus|27|25|And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus|27|26|Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|27|27|And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|28|Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|29|No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|27|30|And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s: it is holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|31|And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.
Leviticus|27|32|And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|33|He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leviticus|27|34|These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
2 Corinthians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:
2 Corinthians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|3|Blessed {be} the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
2 Corinthians|1|4|who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
2 Corinthians|1|5|For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|6|But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:
2 Corinthians|1|7|and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.
2 Corinthians|1|8|For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell {us} in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
2 Corinthians|1|9|yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
2 Corinthians|1|10|who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
2 Corinthians|1|11|ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
2 Corinthians|1|12|For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
2 Corinthians|1|13|For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:
2 Corinthians|1|14|as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2 Corinthians|1|15|And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;
2 Corinthians|1|16|and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.
2 Corinthians|1|17|When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?
2 Corinthians|1|18|But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.
2 Corinthians|1|19|For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, {even} by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.
2 Corinthians|1|20|For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.
2 Corinthians|1|21|Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
2 Corinthians|1|22|who also sealed us, and gave {us} the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2 Corinthians|1|23|But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.
2 Corinthians|1|24|Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.
2 Corinthians|2|1|But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|2|For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?
2 Corinthians|2|3|And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is {the joy} of you all.
2 Corinthians|2|4|For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.
2 Corinthians|2|5|But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.
2 Corinthians|2|6|Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was {inflicted} by the many;
2 Corinthians|2|7|so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|8|Wherefore I beseech you to confirm {your} love toward him.
2 Corinthians|2|9|For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
2 Corinthians|2|10|But to whom ye forgive anything, I {forgive} also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes {have I forgiven it} in the presence of Christ;
2 Corinthians|2|11|that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians|2|12|Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,
2 Corinthians|2|13|I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
2 Corinthians|2|14|But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.
2 Corinthians|2|15|For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;
2 Corinthians|2|16|to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians|2|17|For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.
2 Corinthians|3|1|Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?
2 Corinthians|3|2|Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;
2 Corinthians|3|3|being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables {that are} hearts of flesh.
2 Corinthians|3|4|And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:
2 Corinthians|3|5|not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
2 Corinthians|3|6|who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2 Corinthians|3|7|But if the ministration of death, written, {and} engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which {glory} was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|8|how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?
2 Corinthians|3|9|For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|10|For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.
2 Corinthians|3|11|For if that which passeth away {was} with glory, much more that which remaineth {is} in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|12|Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
2 Corinthians|3|13|and {are} not as Moses, {who} put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|14|but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed {to them} that it is done away in Christ.
2 Corinthians|3|15|But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.
2 Corinthians|3|16|But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
2 Corinthians|3|17|Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, {there} is liberty.
2 Corinthians|3|18|But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.
2 Corinthians|4|1|Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:
2 Corinthians|4|2|but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians|4|3|And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:
2 Corinthians|4|4|in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn {upon them}.
2 Corinthians|4|5|For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
2 Corinthians|4|6|Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians|4|7|But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;
2 Corinthians|4|8|{we are} pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;
2 Corinthians|4|9|pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;
2 Corinthians|4|10|always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.
2 Corinthians|4|11|For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
2 Corinthians|4|12|So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2 Corinthians|4|13|But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;
2 Corinthians|4|14|knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.
2 Corinthians|4|15|For all things {are} for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.
2 Corinthians|4|16|Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
2 Corinthians|4|17|For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;
2 Corinthians|4|18|while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2 Corinthians|5|1|For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
2 Corinthians|5|2|For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:
2 Corinthians|5|3|if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians|5|4|For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
2 Corinthians|5|5|Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2 Corinthians|5|6|Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
2 Corinthians|5|7|(for we walk by faith, not by sight);
2 Corinthians|5|8|we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians|5|9|Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.
2 Corinthians|5|10|For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things {done} in the body, according to what he hath done, whether {it be} good or bad.
2 Corinthians|5|11|Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
2 Corinthians|5|12|We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but {speak} as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.
2 Corinthians|5|13|For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.
2 Corinthians|5|14|For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;
2 Corinthians|5|15|and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.
2 Corinthians|5|16|Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know {him so} no more.
2 Corinthians|5|17|Wherefore if any man is in Christ, {he is} a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.
2 Corinthians|5|18|But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;
2 Corinthians|5|19|to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
2 Corinthians|5|20|We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech {you} on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians|5|21|Him who knew no sin he made {to be} sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
2 Corinthians|6|1|And working together {with him} we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain
2 Corinthians|6|2|(for he saith,             At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee,                   And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:            behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):
2 Corinthians|6|3|giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;
2 Corinthians|6|4|but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
2 Corinthians|6|5|in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
2 Corinthians|6|6|in pureness, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
2 Corinthians|6|7|in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2 Corinthians|6|8|by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and {yet} true;
2 Corinthians|6|9|as unknown, and {yet} well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
2 Corinthians|6|10|as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and {yet} possessing all things.
2 Corinthians|6|11|Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
2 Corinthians|6|12|Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.
2 Corinthians|6|13|Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto {my} children), be ye also enlarged.
2 Corinthians|6|14|Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?
2 Corinthians|6|15|And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians|6|16|And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2 Corinthians|6|17|Wherefore             Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate,            saith the Lord,             And touch no unclean thing;                   And I will receive you,
2 Corinthians|6|18|And will be to you a Father,                   And ye shall be to me sons and daughters,            saith the Lord Almighty.
2 Corinthians|7|1|Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2 Corinthians|7|2|Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.
2 Corinthians|7|3|I say it not to condemn {you}: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together.
2 Corinthians|7|4|Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
2 Corinthians|7|5|For even when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but {we were} afflicted on every side; without {were} fightings, within {were} fears.
2 Corinthians|7|6|Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, {even} God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
2 Corinthians|7|7|and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.
2 Corinthians|7|8|For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it: though I did regret {it} (for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season),
2 Corinthians|7|9|I now rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.
2 Corinthians|7|10|For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, {a repentance} which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
2 Corinthians|7|11|For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea what zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.
2 Corinthians|7|12|So although I wrote unto you, I {wrote} not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians|7|13|Therefore we have been comforted: And in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.
2 Corinthians|7|14|For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.
2 Corinthians|7|15|And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
2 Corinthians|7|16|I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.
2 Corinthians|8|1|Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;
2 Corinthians|8|2|how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians|8|3|For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, {they gave} of their own accord,
2 Corinthians|8|4|beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:
2 Corinthians|8|5|and {this}, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
2 Corinthians|8|6|Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.
2 Corinthians|8|7|But as ye abound in everything, {in} faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and {in} all earnestness, and {in} your love to us, {see} that ye abound in this grace also.
2 Corinthians|8|8|I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
2 Corinthians|8|9|For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.
2 Corinthians|8|10|And herein I give {my} judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.
2 Corinthians|8|11|But now complete the doing also; that as {there was} the readiness to will, so {there may be} the completion also out of your ability.
2 Corinthians|8|12|For if the readiness is there, {it is} acceptable according as {a man} hath, not according as {he} hath not.
2 Corinthians|8|13|For {I say} not {this} that others may be eased {and} ye distressed;
2 Corinthians|8|14|but by equality: your abundance {being a supply} at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become {a supply} for your want; that there may be equality:
2 Corinthians|8|15|as it is written, He that {gathered} much had nothing over; and he that {gathered} little had no lack.
2 Corinthians|8|16|But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians|8|17|For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.
2 Corinthians|8|18|And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel {is spread} through all the churches;
2 Corinthians|8|19|and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in {the matter of} this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and {to show} our readiness:
2 Corinthians|8|20|Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in {the matter of} this bounty which is ministered by us:
2 Corinthians|8|21|for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2 Corinthians|8|22|and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which {he hath} in you.
2 Corinthians|8|23|Whether {any inquire} about Titus, {he is} my partner and {my} fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, {they are} the messengers of the churches, {they are} the glory of Christ.
2 Corinthians|8|24|Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.
2 Corinthians|9|1|For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2 Corinthians|9|2|for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.
2 Corinthians|9|3|But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:
2 Corinthians|9|4|lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.
2 Corinthians|9|5|I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.
2 Corinthians|9|6|But this {I say,} He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
2 Corinthians|9|7|{Let} each man {do} according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
2 Corinthians|9|8|And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:
2 Corinthians|9|9|as it is written,             He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor;                   His righteousness abideth for ever.
2 Corinthians|9|10|And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:
2 Corinthians|9|11|ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians|9|12|For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;
2 Corinthians|9|13|seeing that through the proving {of you} by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of {your} contribution unto them and unto all;
2 Corinthians|9|14|while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
2 Corinthians|9|15|Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians|10|1|Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:
2 Corinthians|10|2|yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians|10|3|For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh
2 Corinthians|10|4|(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds),
2 Corinthians|10|5|casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
2 Corinthians|10|6|and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.
2 Corinthians|10|7|Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
2 Corinthians|10|8|For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:
2 Corinthians|10|9|that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
2 Corinthians|10|10|For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.
2 Corinthians|10|11|Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such {are we} also in deed when we are present.
2 Corinthians|10|12|For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
2 Corinthians|10|13|But we will not glory beyond {our} measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.
2 Corinthians|10|14|For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:
2 Corinthians|10|15|not glorying beyond {our} measure, {that is,} in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto {further} abundance,
2 Corinthians|10|16|so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, {and} not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.
2 Corinthians|10|17|But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2 Corinthians|10|18|For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2 Corinthians|11|1|Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.
2 Corinthians|11|2|For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you {as} a pure virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|3|But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|4|For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or {if} ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with {him}.
2 Corinthians|11|5|For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2 Corinthians|11|6|But though {I be} rude in speech, yet {am I} not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made {this} manifest unto you in all things.
2 Corinthians|11|7|Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?
2 Corinthians|11|8|I robbed other churches, taking wages {of them} that I might minister unto you;
2 Corinthians|11|9|and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and {so} will I keep {myself}.
2 Corinthians|11|10|As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians|11|11|Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2 Corinthians|11|12|But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2 Corinthians|11|13|For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|14|And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians|11|15|It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians|11|16|I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if {ye do}, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.
2 Corinthians|11|17|That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.
2 Corinthians|11|18|Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2 Corinthians|11|19|For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise {yourselves}.
2 Corinthians|11|20|For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you {captive}, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.
2 Corinthians|11|21|I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
2 Corinthians|11|22|Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2 Corinthians|11|23|Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.
2 Corinthians|11|24|Of the Jews five times received I forty {stripes} save one.
2 Corinthians|11|25|Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;
2 Corinthians|11|26|{in} journeyings often, {in} perils of rivers, {in} perils of robbers, {in} perils from {my} countrymen, {in} perils from the Gentiles, {in} perils in the city, {in} perils in the wilderness, {in} perils in the sea, {in} perils among false brethren;
2 Corinthians|11|27|{in} labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2 Corinthians|11|28|Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.
2 Corinthians|11|29|Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?
2 Corinthians|11|30|If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.
2 Corinthians|11|31|The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.
2 Corinthians|11|32|In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:
2 Corinthians|11|33|and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2 Corinthians|12|1|I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians|12|2|I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
2 Corinthians|12|3|And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),
2 Corinthians|12|4|how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2 Corinthians|12|5|On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in {my} weaknesses.
2 Corinthians|12|6|For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me {to be}, or heareth from me.
2 Corinthians|12|7|And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.
2 Corinthians|12|8|Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
2 Corinthians|12|9|And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for {my} power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians|12|10|Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2 Corinthians|12|11|I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
2 Corinthians|12|12|Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians|12|13|For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except {it be} that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.
2 Corinthians|12|14|Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2 Corinthians|12|15|And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
2 Corinthians|12|16|But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2 Corinthians|12|17|Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?
2 Corinthians|12|18|I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? {walked we} not in the same steps?
2 Corinthians|12|19|Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, {are} for your edifying.
2 Corinthians|12|20|For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means {there should be} strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;
2 Corinthians|12|21|lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.
2 Corinthians|13|1|This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word established.
2 Corinthians|13|2|I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
2 Corinthians|13|3|seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:
2 Corinthians|13|4|for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.
2 Corinthians|13|5|Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|6|But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|7|Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|8|For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2 Corinthians|13|9|For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
2 Corinthians|13|10|For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.
2 Corinthians|13|11|Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
2 Corinthians|13|12|Salute one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians|13|13|All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians|13|14|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
Psalms|1|1|Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,                      Nor standeth in the way of sinners,                      Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:
Psalms|1|2|But his delight is in the law of Jehovah;                      And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
Psalms|1|3|And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water,                      That bringeth forth its fruit in its season,                      Whose leaf also doth not wither;                      And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
Psalms|1|4|The wicked are not so,                      But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
Psalms|1|5|Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,                      Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
Psalms|1|6|For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous;                      But the way of the wicked shall perish.
Psalms|2|1|Why do the nations rage,                      And the peoples meditate a vain thing?
Psalms|2|2|The kings of the earth set themselves,                      And the rulers take counsel together,                      Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, {saying},
Psalms|2|3|Let us break their bonds asunder,                      And cast away their cords from us.
Psalms|2|4|He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh:                      The Lord will have them in derision.
Psalms|2|5|Then will he speak unto them in his wrath,                      And vex them in his sore displeasure:
Psalms|2|6|Yet I have set my king                      Upon my holy hill of Zion.
Psalms|2|7|I will tell of the decree:                      Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son;                      This day have I begotten thee.
Psalms|2|8|Ask of me, and I will give {thee} the nations for thine inheritance,                      And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Psalms|2|9|Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;                      Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
Psalms|2|10|Now therefore be wise, O ye kings:                      Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Psalms|2|11|Serve Jehovah with fear,                      And rejoice with trembling.
Psalms|2|12|Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way,                      For his wrath will soon be kindled.                      Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.
Psalms|3|1|Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased!                      Many are they that rise up against me.
Psalms|3|2|Many there are that say of my soul,                      There is no help for him in God.              Selah
Psalms|3|3|But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me;                      My glory and the lifter up of my head.
Psalms|3|4|I cry unto Jehovah with my voice,                      And he answereth me out of his holy hill.              Selah
Psalms|3|5|I laid me down and slept;                      I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.

Psalms|3|7|Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God:                      For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone;                      Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.

Psalms|4|1|Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness;                      Thou hast set me at large {when I was} in distress:                      Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
Psalms|4|2|O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?                               {How long} will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?              Selah
Psalms|4|3|But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly:                      Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.
Psalms|4|4|Stand in awe, and sin not:                      Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.              Selah
Psalms|4|5|Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,                      And put your trust in Jehovah.
Psalms|4|6|Many there are that say, Who will show us {any} good?                      Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
Psalms|4|7|Thou hast put gladness in my heart,                      More than {they have} when their grain and their new wine are increased.

Psalms|5|1|Give ear to my words, O Jehovah,                      Consider my meditation.
Psalms|5|2|Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;                      For unto thee do I pray.
Psalms|5|3|O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice;                      In the morning will I order {my prayer} unto thee, and will keep watch.
Psalms|5|4|For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:                      Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
Psalms|5|5|The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:                      Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
Psalms|5|6|Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:                      Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
Psalms|5|7|But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:                      In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
Psalms|5|8|Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;                      Make thy way straight before my face.
Psalms|5|9|For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;                      Their inward part is very wickedness;                      Their throat is an open sepulchre;                      They flatter with their tongue.
Psalms|5|10|Hold them guilty, O God;                      Let them fall by their own counsels;                      Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;                      For they have rebelled against thee.
Psalms|5|11|But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice,                      Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:                      Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
Psalms|5|12|For thou wilt bless the righteous;                      O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
Psalms|6|1|O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger,                      Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
Psalms|6|2|Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away:                      O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.
Psalms|6|3|My soul also is sore troubled:                      And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
