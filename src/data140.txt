Romans|9|25|As he saith also in Hosea,             I will call that my people, which was not my people;                   And her beloved, that was not beloved.
Romans|9|26|And it shall be, {that} in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people,                   There shall they be called sons of the living God.
Romans|9|27|And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:
Romans|9|28|for the Lord will execute {his} word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.
Romans|9|29|And, as Isaiah hath said before,             Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,                   We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.
Romans|9|30|What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:
Romans|9|31|but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at {that} law.
Romans|9|32|Wherefore? Because {they sought it} not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;
Romans|9|33|even as it is written,             Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:                   And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
Romans|10|1|Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.
Romans|10|2|For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
Romans|10|3|For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Romans|10|4|For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.
Romans|10|5|For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.
Romans|10|6|But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)
Romans|10|7|or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)
Romans|10|8|But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
Romans|10|9|because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus {as} Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:
Romans|10|10|for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Romans|10|11|For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
Romans|10|12|For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same {Lord} is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:
Romans|10|13|for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Romans|10|14|How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans|10|15|and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!
Romans|10|16|But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
Romans|10|17|So belief {cometh} of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
Romans|10|18|But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,             Their sound went out into all the earth,                   And their words unto the ends of the world.
Romans|10|19|But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith,             I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,                   With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.
Romans|10|20|And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,             I was found of them that sought me not;                   I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.
Romans|10|21|But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
Romans|11|1|I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans|11|2|God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:
Romans|11|3|Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
Romans|11|4|But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
Romans|11|5|Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Romans|11|6|But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
Romans|11|7|What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:
Romans|11|8|according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.
Romans|11|9|And David saith,             Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,                   And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:
Romans|11|10|Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,                   And bow thou down their back always.
Romans|11|11|I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation {is come} unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
Romans|11|12|Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
Romans|11|13|But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
Romans|11|14|if by any means I may provoke to jealousy {them that are} my flesh, and may save some of them.
Romans|11|15|For if the casting away of them {is} the reconciling of the world, what {shall} the receiving {of them be}, but life from the dead?
Romans|11|16|And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans|11|17|But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;
Romans|11|18|glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.
Romans|11|19|Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Romans|11|20|Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
Romans|11|21|for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
Romans|11|22|Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
Romans|11|23|And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans|11|24|For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural {branches}, be grafted into their own olive tree?
Romans|11|25|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;
Romans|11|26|and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,             There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;                   He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
Romans|11|27|And this is my covenant unto them,                   When I shall take away their sins.
Romans|11|28|As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
Romans|11|29|For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.
Romans|11|30|For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
Romans|11|31|even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
Romans|11|32|For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
Romans|11|33|O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
Romans|11|34|For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
Romans|11|35|or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
Romans|11|36|For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him {be} the glory for ever. Amen.
Romans|12|1|I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, {which is} your spiritual service.
Romans|12|2|And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
Romans|12|3|For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.
Romans|12|4|For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:
Romans|12|5|so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
Romans|12|6|And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, {let us prophesy} according to the proportion of our faith;
Romans|12|7|or ministry, {let us give ourselves} to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;
Romans|12|8|or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, {let him do it} with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Romans|12|9|Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Romans|12|10|In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;
Romans|12|11|in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Romans|12|12|rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;
Romans|12|13|communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.
Romans|12|14|Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.
Romans|12|15|Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
Romans|12|16|Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Romans|12|17|Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.
Romans|12|18|If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.
Romans|12|19|Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath {of God}: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.
Romans|12|20|But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.
Romans|12|21|Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans|13|1|Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the {powers} that be are ordained of God.
Romans|13|2|Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.
Romans|13|3|For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:
Romans|13|4|for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.
Romans|13|5|Wherefore {ye} must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
Romans|13|6|For this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.
Romans|13|7|Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute {is due}; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
Romans|13|8|Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.
Romans|13|9|For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Romans|13|10|Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.
Romans|13|11|And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we {first} believed.
Romans|13|12|The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Romans|13|13|Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.
