Genesis|41|48|And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
Genesis|41|49|And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
Genesis|41|50|And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.
Genesis|41|51|And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, {said he}, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
Genesis|41|52|And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis|41|53|And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
Genesis|41|54|And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Genesis|41|55|And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
Genesis|41|56|And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|57|And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.
Genesis|42|1|Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
Genesis|42|2|And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
Genesis|42|3|And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis|42|4|But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.
Genesis|42|5|And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|6|And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
Genesis|42|7|And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Genesis|42|8|And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
Genesis|42|9|And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|10|And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
Genesis|42|11|We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
Genesis|42|12|And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|13|And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
Genesis|42|14|And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
Genesis|42|15|hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Genesis|42|16|Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
Genesis|42|17|And he put them all together into ward three days.
Genesis|42|18|And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:
Genesis|42|19|if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:
Genesis|42|20|and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
Genesis|42|21|And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
Genesis|42|22|And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
Genesis|42|23|And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
Genesis|42|24|And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis|42|25|Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them.
Genesis|42|26|And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
Genesis|42|27|And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis|42|28|And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
Genesis|42|29|And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
Genesis|42|30|The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis|42|31|And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:
Genesis|42|32|we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|33|And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take {grain for} the famine of your houses, and go your way;
Genesis|42|34|and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.
Genesis|42|35|And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Genesis|42|36|And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
Genesis|42|37|And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
Genesis|42|38|And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|43|1|And the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|43|2|And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis|43|3|And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|4|If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
Genesis|43|5|but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|6|And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
Genesis|43|7|And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Genesis|43|8|And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
Genesis|43|9|I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
Genesis|43|10|for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
Genesis|43|11|And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
Genesis|43|12|and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
Genesis|43|13|take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Genesis|43|14|and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Genesis|43|15|And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Genesis|43|16|And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
Genesis|43|17|And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.
Genesis|43|18|And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
Genesis|43|19|And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,
Genesis|43|20|and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
Genesis|43|21|and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
Genesis|43|22|And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis|43|23|And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
Genesis|43|24|And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.
Genesis|43|25|And they made ready the present against Joseph’s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Genesis|43|26|And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
Genesis|43|27|And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
Genesis|43|28|And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
Genesis|43|29|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
Genesis|43|30|And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
Genesis|43|31|And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
Genesis|43|32|And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis|43|33|And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.
Genesis|43|34|And he took {and sent} messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Genesis|44|1|And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
Genesis|44|2|And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Genesis|44|3|As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Genesis|44|4|{And} when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis|44|5|Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Genesis|44|6|And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
Genesis|44|7|And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
Genesis|44|8|Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
Genesis|44|9|With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
Genesis|44|10|And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.
Genesis|44|11|Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Genesis|44|12|And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Genesis|44|13|Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
Genesis|44|14|And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis|44|15|And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
Genesis|44|16|And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
Genesis|44|17|And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Genesis|44|18|Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
