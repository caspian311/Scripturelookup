2 John|1|1|The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;
2 John|1|2|for the truth’s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:
2 John|1|3|Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
2 John|1|4|of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
2 John|1|5|And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
2 John|1|6|And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
2 John|1|7|they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
2 John|1|8|Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.
2 John|1|9|Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.
2 John|1|10|house, and give him no greeting:
2 John|1|11|for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
2 John|1|12|with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
2 John|1|13|
Colossians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
Colossians|1|2|at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians|1|3|We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Colossians|1|4|having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,
Colossians|1|5|because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
Colossians|1|6|in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
Colossians|1|7|even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
Colossians|1|8|who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians|1|9|, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians|1|10|to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians|1|11|strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;
Colossians|1|12|giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
Colossians|1|13|who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;
Colossians|1|14|in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:
Colossians|1|15|who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
Colossians|1|16|for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;
Colossians|1|17|and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.
Colossians|1|18|And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
Colossians|1|19|that in him should all the fulness dwell;
Colossians|1|20|, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.
Colossians|1|21|And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,
Colossians|1|22|yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:
Colossians|1|23|if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.
Colossians|1|24|Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;
Colossians|1|25|whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil the word of God,
Colossians|1|26|the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints,
Colossians|1|27|to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
Colossians|1|28|whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
Colossians|1|29|
Colossians|2|1|For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
Colossians|2|2|Christ,
Colossians|2|3|in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
Colossians|2|4|This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.
Colossians|2|5|For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians|2|6|walk in him,
Colossians|2|7|rooted and builded up in him, and established in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
Colossians|2|8|Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:
Colossians|2|9|for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
Colossians|2|10|and in him ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:
Colossians|2|11|in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
Colossians|2|12|having been buried with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
Colossians|2|13|, did he make alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;
Colossians|2|14|having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
Colossians|2|15|having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
Colossians|2|16|Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day:
Colossians|2|17|which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s.
Colossians|2|18|Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
Colossians|2|19|and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increasing with the increase of God.
Colossians|2|20|If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances,
Colossians|2|21|Handle not, nor taste, nor touch
Colossians|2|22|(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?
Colossians|2|23|
Colossians|3|1|If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.
Colossians|3|2|Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.
Colossians|3|3|For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Colossians|3|4|our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.
Colossians|3|5|Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
Colossians|3|6|for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:
Colossians|3|7|wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;
Colossians|3|8|but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:
Colossians|3|9|lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,
Colossians|3|10|and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:
Colossians|3|11|where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
Colossians|3|12|Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;
Colossians|3|13|forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye:
Colossians|3|14|love, which is the bond of perfectness.
Colossians|3|15|And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.
Colossians|3|16|spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.
Colossians|3|17|all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
Colossians|3|18|Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Colossians|3|19|Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
Colossians|3|20|Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.
Colossians|3|21|Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.
Colossians|3|22|Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:
Colossians|3|23|whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;
Colossians|3|24|knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians|3|25|
Colossians|4|1|Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
Colossians|4|2|Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
Colossians|4|3|withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
Colossians|4|4|that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
Colossians|4|5|Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
Colossians|4|6|Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.
Colossians|4|7|All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord:
Colossians|4|8|whom I have sent you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts;
Colossians|4|9|here.
Colossians|4|10|Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him),
Colossians|4|11|fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, men that have been a comfort unto me.
Colossians|4|12|Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
Colossians|4|13|For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
Colossians|4|14|Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you.
Colossians|4|15|Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house.
Colossians|4|16|And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.
Colossians|4|17|And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
Colossians|4|18|

Matthew|1|17|
Matthew|1|18|Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|19|And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
Matthew|1|20|But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|21|And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.
Matthew|1|22|
Matthew|1|23|which is, being interpreted, God with us.
Matthew|1|24|And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;
Matthew|1|25|
Matthew|2|1|Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew|2|2|Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
Matthew|2|3|And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew|2|4|And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
Matthew|2|5|
Matthew|2|6|
Matthew|2|7|Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.
Matthew|2|8|bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.
Matthew|2|9|And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
Matthew|2|10|And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Matthew|2|11|And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew|2|12|
Matthew|2|13|Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Matthew|2|14|And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;
Matthew|2|15|
Matthew|2|16|Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.
Matthew|2|17|
Matthew|2|18|
Matthew|2|19|But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
Matthew|2|20|Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.
Matthew|2|21|And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew|2|22|in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,
Matthew|2|23|
Matthew|3|1|And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,
Matthew|3|2|Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|3|3|
Matthew|3|4|Now John himself had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew|3|5|Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;
Matthew|3|6|and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew|3|7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:
Matthew|3|9|and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Matthew|3|10|And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew|3|11|fire:
Matthew|3|12|
Matthew|3|13|Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
Matthew|3|14|But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew|3|15|now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffereth him.
Matthew|3|16|And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;
Matthew|3|17|
Matthew|4|1|Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
Matthew|4|2|And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
Matthew|4|3|And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
Matthew|4|4|But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
Matthew|4|5|Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew|4|6|
Matthew|4|7|Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
Matthew|4|8|Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
Matthew|4|9|and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Matthew|4|10|Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Matthew|4|11|
Matthew|4|12|Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;
Matthew|4|13|and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
Matthew|4|14|
Matthew|4|15|
Matthew|4|16|
Matthew|4|17|
Matthew|4|18|And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
Matthew|4|19|And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew|4|20|And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
Matthew|4|21|of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
Matthew|4|22|
Matthew|4|23|And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.
Matthew|4|24|And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
Matthew|4|25|
Matthew|5|1|And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:
Matthew|5|2|
Matthew|5|3|
Matthew|5|4|
Matthew|5|5|
Matthew|5|6|
Matthew|5|7|
Matthew|5|8|
Matthew|5|9|
Matthew|5|10|Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|11|shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Matthew|5|12|
Matthew|5|13|Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.
Matthew|5|14|Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
Matthew|5|15|light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.
Matthew|5|16|
Matthew|5|17|Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
Matthew|5|18|For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.
Matthew|5|19|Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|20|
Matthew|5|21|Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
Matthew|5|22|but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.
Matthew|5|23|If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,
Matthew|5|24|leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
Matthew|5|25|Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
Matthew|5|26|
Matthew|5|27|Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
Matthew|5|28|but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
Matthew|5|29|And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.
Matthew|5|30|And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.
Matthew|5|31|It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
Matthew|5|32|
Matthew|5|33|Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
Matthew|5|34|but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;
Matthew|5|35|nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Matthew|5|36|Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.
Matthew|5|37|
Matthew|5|38|Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
Matthew|5|39|but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Matthew|5|40|And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
Matthew|5|41|And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.
Matthew|5|42|
Matthew|5|43|Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:
Matthew|5|44|but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;
Matthew|5|45|that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.
Matthew|5|46|For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
Matthew|5|47|do not even the Gentiles the same?
Matthew|5|48|
Matthew|6|1|Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|6|2|When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|3|But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
Matthew|6|4|
Matthew|6|5|And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|6|But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
Matthew|6|7|And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
Matthew|6|8|Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
Matthew|6|9|After this manner therefore pray ye. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Matthew|6|10|Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Matthew|6|11|Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew|6|12|And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Matthew|6|13|
Matthew|6|14|For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
Matthew|6|15|
Matthew|6|16|Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|17|But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
Matthew|6|18|
Matthew|6|19|Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:
Matthew|6|20|but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
Matthew|6|21|for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.
Matthew|6|22|The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
Matthew|6|23|But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!
Matthew|6|24|No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Matthew|6|25|Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?
Matthew|6|26|Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they?
Matthew|6|27|And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life?
Matthew|6|28|And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
Matthew|6|29|yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Matthew|6|30|you, O ye of little faith?
Matthew|6|31|Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
Matthew|6|32|For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
Matthew|6|33|But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Matthew|6|34|
Matthew|7|1|Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Matthew|7|2|For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.
Matthew|7|3|And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Matthew|7|4|Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?
Matthew|7|5|
Matthew|7|6|
Matthew|7|7|Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
Matthew|7|8|for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Matthew|7|9|Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;
Matthew|7|10|or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
Matthew|7|11|If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
Matthew|7|12|
Matthew|7|13|Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many are they that enter in thereby.
Matthew|7|14|
Matthew|7|15|Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
Matthew|7|16|gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Matthew|7|17|Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
Matthew|7|18|A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Matthew|7|19|Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew|7|20|Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Matthew|7|21|Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|7|22|Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?
Matthew|7|23|
Matthew|7|24|Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:
Matthew|7|25|and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.
Matthew|7|26|And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
Matthew|7|27|
Matthew|7|28|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
Matthew|7|29|
Matthew|8|1|And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
Matthew|8|2|And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Matthew|8|3|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew|8|4|
Matthew|8|5|And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
Matthew|8|6|and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
Matthew|8|7|And he saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
Matthew|8|8|And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Matthew|8|9|For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Matthew|8|10|And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Matthew|8|11|And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
Matthew|8|12|but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|8|13|
Matthew|8|14|And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
Matthew|8|15|And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him.
Matthew|8|16|And when even was come, they brought unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick:
Matthew|8|17|
Matthew|8|18|Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side.
Matthew|8|19|And there came a scribe, and said unto him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Matthew|8|20|nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Matthew|8|21|And another of the disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Matthew|8|22|
Matthew|8|23|And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
Matthew|8|24|And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
Matthew|8|25|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.
Matthew|8|26|And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
Matthew|8|27|
Matthew|8|28|And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
Matthew|8|29|And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
Matthew|8|30|Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
Matthew|8|31|And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.
Matthew|8|32|And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.
Matthew|8|33|And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons.
Matthew|8|34|
Matthew|9|1|And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
Matthew|9|2|And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.
Matthew|9|3|And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
Matthew|9|4|And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
Matthew|9|5|For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?
Matthew|9|6|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up unto thy house.
Matthew|9|7|And he arose, and departed to his house.
Matthew|9|8|
Matthew|9|9|
Matthew|9|10|And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew|9|11|And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners?
Matthew|9|12|But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
Matthew|9|13|
Matthew|9|14|Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
Matthew|9|15|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
Matthew|9|16|And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
Matthew|9|17|
Matthew|9|18|While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
Matthew|9|19|his disciples.
Matthew|9|20|And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:
Matthew|9|21|for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.
Matthew|9|22|But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
Matthew|9|23|And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,
Matthew|9|24|he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
Matthew|9|25|But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.
Matthew|9|26|
Matthew|9|27|And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|9|28|And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew|9|29|Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.
Matthew|9|30|And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
Matthew|9|31|
Matthew|9|32|And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
Matthew|9|33|And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
Matthew|9|34|
Matthew|9|35|And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
Matthew|9|36|But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Matthew|9|37|Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
Matthew|9|38|
Matthew|10|1|
Matthew|10|2|of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew|10|3|of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew|10|4|
Matthew|10|5|way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans:
Matthew|10|6|but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|10|7|And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|10|8|Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.
Matthew|10|9|Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
Matthew|10|10|journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
Matthew|10|11|And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.
Matthew|10|12|And as ye enter into the house, salute it.
Matthew|10|13|And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
Matthew|10|14|And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.
Matthew|10|15|
Matthew|10|16|Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Matthew|10|17|But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you;
Matthew|10|18|yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
Matthew|10|19|But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
Matthew|10|20|For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
Matthew|10|21|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Matthew|10|22|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew|10|23|
Matthew|10|24|A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
Matthew|10|25|It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!
Matthew|10|26|Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Matthew|10|27|What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops.
Matthew|10|28|And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew|10|29|Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:
Matthew|10|30|but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew|10|31|Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew|10|32|Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|10|33|
Matthew|10|34|Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
Matthew|10|35|For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:
Matthew|10|36|they of his own household.
Matthew|10|37|He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|38|And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|39|
Matthew|10|40|He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
Matthew|10|41|He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew|10|42|
Matthew|11|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew|11|2|Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples
Matthew|11|3|and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Matthew|11|4|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:
Matthew|11|5|the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Matthew|11|6|
Matthew|11|7|And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Matthew|11|8|are in king’s houses.
Matthew|11|9|But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Matthew|11|10|
Matthew|11|11|Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew|11|12|And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.
Matthew|11|13|For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew|11|14|this is Elijah, that is to come.
Matthew|11|15|He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|11|16|But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows
Matthew|11|17|and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.
Matthew|11|18|For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.
Matthew|11|19|
Matthew|11|20|Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
Matthew|11|21|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew|11|22|But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew|11|23|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.
Matthew|11|24|
Matthew|11|25|At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:
Matthew|11|26|yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Matthew|11|27|
Matthew|11|28|Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Matthew|11|29|Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
Matthew|11|30|
Matthew|12|1|At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.
Matthew|12|2|But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.
Matthew|12|3|But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;
Matthew|12|4|how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?
Matthew|12|5|Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?
Matthew|12|6|But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.
Matthew|12|7|But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew|12|8|
Matthew|12|9|And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:
Matthew|12|10|and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.
Matthew|12|11|And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
Matthew|12|12|How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
Matthew|12|13|Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
Matthew|12|14|
Matthew|12|15|withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,
Matthew|12|16|and charged them that they should not make him known:
Matthew|12|17|
Matthew|12|18|
Matthew|12|19|
Matthew|12|20|
Matthew|12|21|
Matthew|12|22|Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.
Matthew|12|23|And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?
Matthew|12|24|But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
Matthew|12|25|And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
Matthew|12|26|and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
Matthew|12|27|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Matthew|12|28|But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Matthew|12|29|? and then he will spoil his house.
Matthew|12|30|He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Matthew|12|31|Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
Matthew|12|32|And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.
Matthew|12|33|Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.
Matthew|12|34|Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
Matthew|12|35|The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
Matthew|12|36|And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
Matthew|12|37|
Matthew|12|38|Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.
Matthew|12|39|But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
Matthew|12|40|for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew|12|41|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Matthew|12|42|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Matthew|12|43|But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.
Matthew|12|44|Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
Matthew|12|45|
Matthew|12|46|While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
Matthew|12|47|And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
Matthew|12|48|But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Matthew|12|49|And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Matthew|12|50|
Matthew|13|1|On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
Matthew|13|2|And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
Matthew|13|3|And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
Matthew|13|4|fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:
Matthew|13|5|and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:
Matthew|13|6|and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew|13|7|And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:
Matthew|13|8|and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew|13|9|
Matthew|13|10|And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
Matthew|13|11|And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
Matthew|13|12|For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew|13|13|Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
Matthew|13|14|
Matthew|13|15|
Matthew|13|16|But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Matthew|13|17|For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Matthew|13|18|Hear then ye the parable of the sower.
Matthew|13|19|, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.
Matthew|13|20|And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;
Matthew|13|21|yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.
Matthew|13|22|And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
Matthew|13|23|
Matthew|13|24|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:
Matthew|13|25|but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
Matthew|13|26|But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
Matthew|13|27|And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?
Matthew|13|28|And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
Matthew|13|29|But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.
Matthew|13|30|
Matthew|13|31|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
Matthew|13|32|
Matthew|13|33|
Matthew|13|34|All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:
Matthew|13|35|
Matthew|13|36|Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
Matthew|13|37|And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
Matthew|13|38|;
Matthew|13|39|and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew|13|40|As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
Matthew|13|41|The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,
Matthew|13|42|and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|43|
Matthew|13|44|
Matthew|13|45|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:
Matthew|13|46|
Matthew|13|47|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
Matthew|13|48|which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.
Matthew|13|49|So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,
Matthew|13|50|
Matthew|13|51|Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.
Matthew|13|52|
Matthew|13|53|
Matthew|13|54|And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Matthew|13|55|Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew|13|56|And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
Matthew|13|57|And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
Matthew|13|58|
Matthew|14|1|At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
Matthew|14|2|and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.
Matthew|14|3|For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
Matthew|14|4|For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew|14|5|And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew|14|6|But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Matthew|14|7|Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.
Matthew|14|8|And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Matthew|14|9|And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given;
Matthew|14|10|and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew|14|11|And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew|14|12|
Matthew|14|13|they followed him on foot from the cities.
Matthew|14|14|And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
Matthew|14|15|And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
Matthew|14|16|But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.
Matthew|14|17|And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
Matthew|14|18|And he said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew|14|19|And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|14|20|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
Matthew|14|21|
Matthew|14|22|And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.
Matthew|14|23|And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.
Matthew|14|24|But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
Matthew|14|25|And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
Matthew|14|26|And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
Matthew|14|27|But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew|14|28|And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
Matthew|14|29|And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
Matthew|14|30|But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
Matthew|14|31|And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
Matthew|14|32|And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Matthew|14|33|
Matthew|14|34|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.
Matthew|14|35|And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick,
Matthew|14|36|
Matthew|15|1|Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,
Matthew|15|2|Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew|15|3|And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Matthew|15|4|For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.
Matthew|15|5|;
Matthew|15|6|he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.
Matthew|15|7|
Matthew|15|8|
Matthew|15|9|
Matthew|15|10|And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
Matthew|15|11|Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.
Matthew|15|12|Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
Matthew|15|13|But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.
Matthew|15|14|Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.
Matthew|15|15|And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.
Matthew|15|16|And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?
Matthew|15|17|Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew|15|18|But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew|15|19|For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:
Matthew|15|20|
Matthew|15|21|And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew|15|22|And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
Matthew|15|23|But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
Matthew|15|24|But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|15|25|But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew|15|26|And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Matthew|15|27|But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
Matthew|15|28|
Matthew|15|29|And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
Matthew|15|30|And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:
Matthew|15|31|
Matthew|15|32|And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.
Matthew|15|33|And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?
Matthew|15|34|And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
Matthew|15|35|And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
Matthew|15|36|and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|15|37|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
Matthew|15|38|And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew|15|39|
Matthew|16|1|And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Matthew|16|2|fair weather: for the heaven is red.
Matthew|16|3|the signs of the times.
Matthew|16|4|
Matthew|16|5|And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.
Matthew|16|6|And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|7|And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread.
Matthew|16|8|And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread?
Matthew|16|9|Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|10|Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|11|How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|12|
Matthew|16|13|Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?
Matthew|16|14|John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
Matthew|16|15|He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am?
Matthew|16|16|And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew|16|17|And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|16|18|And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
Matthew|16|19|I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|16|20|
Matthew|16|21|From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Matthew|16|22|And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee.
Matthew|16|23|But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Matthew|16|24|Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew|16|25|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew|16|26|For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?
Matthew|16|27|For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds.
Matthew|16|28|
Matthew|17|1|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
Matthew|17|2|and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
Matthew|17|3|And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
Matthew|17|4|And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Matthew|17|5|While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
Matthew|17|6|And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew|17|7|And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
Matthew|17|8|
Matthew|17|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead.
Matthew|17|10|And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
Matthew|17|11|And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things:
Matthew|17|12|but I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them.
Matthew|17|13|
Matthew|17|14|And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying,
Matthew|17|15|Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and off-times into the water.
Matthew|17|16|And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew|17|17|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
Matthew|17|18|
Matthew|17|19|Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
Matthew|17|20|And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
Matthew|17|21|
Matthew|17|22|And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men;
Matthew|17|23|
Matthew|17|24|And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel?
Matthew|17|25|He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?
Matthew|17|26|And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.
Matthew|17|27|
Matthew|18|1|In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew|18|2|And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,
Matthew|18|3|and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|4|Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|5|And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:
Matthew|18|6|
Matthew|18|7|Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!
Matthew|18|8|And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
Matthew|18|9|And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
Matthew|18|10|See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|11|
Matthew|18|12|How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray?
Matthew|18|13|And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray.
Matthew|18|14|
Matthew|18|15|And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
Matthew|18|16|not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established.
Matthew|18|17|And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican.
Matthew|18|18|Verily I say unto you, what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|18|19|Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|20|
Matthew|18|21|Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?
Matthew|18|22|Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.
Matthew|18|23|Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants.
Matthew|18|24|And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
Matthew|18|25|to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
Matthew|18|26|The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew|18|27|And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
Matthew|18|28|by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.
Matthew|18|29|So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
Matthew|18|30|And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due.
Matthew|18|31|So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
Matthew|18|32|Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me:
Matthew|18|33|shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?
Matthew|18|34|And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.
Matthew|18|35|
Matthew|19|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
Matthew|19|2|
Matthew|19|3|to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew|19|4|from the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew|19|5|and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?
Matthew|19|6|So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Matthew|19|7|away?
Matthew|19|8|He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.
Matthew|19|9|And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.
Matthew|19|10|The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
Matthew|19|11|But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.
Matthew|19|12|
Matthew|19|13|Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew|19|14|But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|15|
Matthew|19|16|And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew|19|17|And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew|19|18|He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Matthew|19|19|Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|19|20|The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?
Matthew|19|21|Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Matthew|19|22|
Matthew|19|23|And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|24|And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew|19|25|And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?
Matthew|19|26|said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
Matthew|19|27|Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?
Matthew|19|28|And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew|19|29|And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
Matthew|19|30|
Matthew|20|1|For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|2|And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|3|And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;
Matthew|20|4|and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Matthew|20|5|Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
Matthew|20|6|he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Matthew|20|7|They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
Matthew|20|8|And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Matthew|20|9|about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|10|And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|11|And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,
Matthew|20|12|one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
Matthew|20|13|But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?
Matthew|20|14|Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Matthew|20|15|Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Matthew|20|16|
Matthew|20|17|And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,
Matthew|20|18|Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,
Matthew|20|19|
Matthew|20|20|, and asking a certain thing of him.
Matthew|20|21|And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.
Matthew|20|22|But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.
Matthew|20|23|for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.
Matthew|20|24|And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.
Matthew|20|25|But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Matthew|20|26|Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;
Matthew|20|27|and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:
Matthew|20|28|
Matthew|20|29|And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Matthew|20|30|And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|31|And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|32|And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?
Matthew|20|33|They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew|20|34|
Matthew|21|1|And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
Matthew|21|2|unto me.
Matthew|21|3|And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Matthew|21|4|
Matthew|21|5|
Matthew|21|6|And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,
Matthew|21|7|and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.
Matthew|21|8|And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.
Matthew|21|9|he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Matthew|21|10|And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?
Matthew|21|11|
Matthew|21|12|And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Matthew|21|13|and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.
Matthew|21|14|And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew|21|15|But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,
Matthew|21|16|and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?
Matthew|21|17|
Matthew|21|18|Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.
Matthew|21|19|And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
Matthew|21|20|And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
Matthew|21|21|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.
Matthew|21|22|
Matthew|21|23|And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew|21|24|And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|25|The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
Matthew|21|26|But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew|21|27|And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|28|But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.
Matthew|21|29|And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.
Matthew|21|30|, sir: and went not.
Matthew|21|31|Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew|21|32|
Matthew|21|33|Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Matthew|21|34|And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.
Matthew|21|35|And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew|21|36|Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.
Matthew|21|37|But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew|21|38|But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.
Matthew|21|39|And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
Matthew|21|40|When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Matthew|21|41|They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew|21|42|
Matthew|21|43|Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Matthew|21|44|And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Matthew|21|45|And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Matthew|21|46|
Matthew|22|1|And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,
Matthew|22|2|The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
Matthew|22|3|and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
Matthew|22|4|Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|5|But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;
Matthew|22|6|and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
Matthew|22|7|But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
Matthew|22|8|Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.
Matthew|22|9|Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|10|And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
Matthew|22|11|But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:
Matthew|22|12|and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
Matthew|22|13|Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|22|14|
Matthew|22|15|talk.
Matthew|22|16|And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Matthew|22|17|Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Matthew|22|18|But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?
Matthew|22|19|Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.
Matthew|22|20|And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Matthew|22|21|They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
Matthew|22|22|
Matthew|22|23|On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,
Matthew|22|24|saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew|22|25|Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;
Matthew|22|26|in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Matthew|22|27|And after them all, the woman died.
Matthew|22|28|In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Matthew|22|29|But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Matthew|22|30|For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
Matthew|22|31|But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Matthew|22|32|of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew|22|33|
Matthew|22|34|But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.
Matthew|22|35|And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:
Matthew|22|36|Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew|22|37|And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matthew|22|38|This is the great and first commandment.
Matthew|22|39|is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|22|40|
Matthew|22|41|Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
Matthew|22|42|of David.
Matthew|22|43|
Matthew|22|44|
Matthew|22|45|If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
Matthew|22|46|
Matthew|23|1|Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples,
Matthew|23|2|saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses seat:
Matthew|23|3|do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.
Matthew|23|4|Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.
Matthew|23|5|,
Matthew|23|6|and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew|23|7|and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
Matthew|23|8|But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren.
Matthew|23|9|he who is in heaven.
Matthew|23|10|the Christ.
Matthew|23|11|But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew|23|12|
Matthew|23|13|
Matthew|23|14|
Matthew|23|15|
Matthew|23|16|Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
Matthew|23|17|Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?
Matthew|23|18|And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.
Matthew|23|19|Ye blind: for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Matthew|23|20|He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
Matthew|23|21|And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
Matthew|23|22|
Matthew|23|23|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.
Matthew|23|24|
Matthew|23|25|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess.
Matthew|23|26|
Matthew|23|27|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
Matthew|23|28|
Matthew|23|29|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous,
Matthew|23|30|and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Matthew|23|31|Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets.
Matthew|23|32|Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Matthew|23|33|Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell?
Matthew|23|34|Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
Matthew|23|35|that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar.
Matthew|23|36|
Matthew|23|37|O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Matthew|23|38|Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
Matthew|23|39|
Matthew|24|1|And Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew|24|2|
Matthew|24|3|the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
Matthew|24|4|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
Matthew|24|5|For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray.
Matthew|24|6|must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
Matthew|24|7|For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places.
Matthew|24|8|But all these things are the beginning of travail.
Matthew|24|9|Then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name’s sake.
Matthew|24|10|And then shall many stumble, and shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.
Matthew|24|11|And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray.
Matthew|24|12|And because iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold.
Matthew|24|13|But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew|24|14|
Matthew|24|15|When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),
Matthew|24|16|then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains:
Matthew|24|17|let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house:
Matthew|24|18|and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
Matthew|24|19|But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
Matthew|24|20|And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath:
Matthew|24|21|for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.
Matthew|24|22|And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
Matthew|24|23|not.
Matthew|24|24|For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Matthew|24|25|Behold, I have told you beforehand.
Matthew|24|26|not.
Matthew|24|27|For as the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|28|
Matthew|24|29|But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
Matthew|24|30|and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew|24|31|
Matthew|24|32|Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;
Matthew|24|33|at the doors.
Matthew|24|34|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.
Matthew|24|35|Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
Matthew|24|36|But of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.
Matthew|24|37|the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|38|For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
Matthew|24|39|and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|40|Then shall two man be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:
Matthew|24|41|grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.
Matthew|24|42|Watch therefore: for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh.
Matthew|24|43|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
Matthew|24|44|
Matthew|24|45|Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
Matthew|24|46|Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Matthew|24|47|Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
Matthew|24|48|But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth;
Matthew|24|49|and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;
Matthew|24|50|the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not,
Matthew|24|51|
Matthew|25|1|Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew|25|2|And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
Matthew|25|3|For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:
Matthew|25|4|but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew|25|5|Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew|25|6|But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.
Matthew|25|7|Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew|25|8|And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.
Matthew|25|9|But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew|25|10|And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.
Matthew|25|11|Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Matthew|25|12|But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew|25|13|
Matthew|25|14|a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Matthew|25|15|And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.
Matthew|25|16|Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.
Matthew|25|17|the two gained other two.
Matthew|25|18|But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
Matthew|25|19|Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.
Matthew|25|20|And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.
Matthew|25|21|His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew|25|22|the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.
Matthew|25|23|His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew|25|24|And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;
Matthew|25|25|and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.
Matthew|25|26|But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;
Matthew|25|27|thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.
Matthew|25|28|Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.
Matthew|25|29|For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.
Matthew|25|30|
Matthew|25|31|But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:
Matthew|25|32|and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;
Matthew|25|33|and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Matthew|25|34|Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Matthew|25|35|for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
Matthew|25|36|naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Matthew|25|37|Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?
Matthew|25|38|And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Matthew|25|39|And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Matthew|25|40|these least, ye did it unto me.
Matthew|25|41|Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:
Matthew|25|42|for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
Matthew|25|43|I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Matthew|25|44|Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Matthew|25|45|Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.
Matthew|25|46|
Matthew|26|1|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,
Matthew|26|2|Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
Matthew|26|3|Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;
Matthew|26|4|and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.
Matthew|26|5|
Matthew|26|6|Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew|26|7|there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.
Matthew|26|8|But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
Matthew|26|9|might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew|26|10|But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
Matthew|26|11|For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew|26|12|For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
Matthew|26|13|
Matthew|26|14|Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
Matthew|26|15|and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew|26|16|
Matthew|26|17|of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew|26|18|And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
Matthew|26|19|
Matthew|26|20|Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;
Matthew|26|21|and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
Matthew|26|22|And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?
Matthew|26|23|And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
Matthew|26|24|The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
Matthew|26|25|
Matthew|26|26|And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
Matthew|26|27|And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
Matthew|26|28|for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.
Matthew|26|29|
Matthew|26|30|
Matthew|26|31|Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
Matthew|26|32|But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew|26|33|But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.
Matthew|26|34|Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Matthew|26|35|
Matthew|26|36|Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.
Matthew|26|37|And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.
Matthew|26|38|Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.
Matthew|26|39|And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
Matthew|26|40|And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Matthew|26|41|Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Matthew|26|42|Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew|26|43|And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew|26|44|And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.
Matthew|26|45|Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew|26|46|
Matthew|26|47|And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.
Matthew|26|48|Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.
Matthew|26|49|And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
Matthew|26|50|that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Matthew|26|51|And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
Matthew|26|52|Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Matthew|26|53|Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew|26|54|How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?
Matthew|26|55|In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.
Matthew|26|56|
Matthew|26|57|Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
Matthew|26|58|But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.
Matthew|26|59|Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
Matthew|26|60|and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,
Matthew|26|61|and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew|26|62|And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Matthew|26|63|But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew|26|64|Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Matthew|26|65|Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:
Matthew|26|66|what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
Matthew|26|67|Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,
Matthew|26|68|
Matthew|26|69|Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.
Matthew|26|70|But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
Matthew|26|71|saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
Matthew|26|72|And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
Matthew|26|73|of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.
Matthew|26|74|Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.
Matthew|26|75|
Matthew|27|1|Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
Matthew|27|2|
Matthew|27|3|Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew|27|4|.
Matthew|27|5|And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew|27|6|And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.
Matthew|27|7|And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Matthew|27|8|Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day.
Matthew|27|9|of the children of Israel did price;
Matthew|27|10|
Matthew|27|11|Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
Matthew|27|12|And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Matthew|27|13|Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Matthew|27|14|And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Matthew|27|15|Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
Matthew|27|16|And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew|27|17|When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
Matthew|27|18|For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
Matthew|27|19|And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
Matthew|27|20|Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew|27|21|But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
Matthew|27|22|Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|23|And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|24|.
Matthew|27|25|on us, and on our children.
Matthew|27|26|
Matthew|27|27|Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.
Matthew|27|28|And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew|27|29|And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew|27|30|And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.
Matthew|27|31|
Matthew|27|32|
Matthew|27|33|And they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,
Matthew|27|34|they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
Matthew|27|35|And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;
Matthew|27|36|and they sat and watched him there.
Matthew|27|37|And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew|27|38|Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
Matthew|27|39|And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
Matthew|27|40|and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew|27|41|, with the scribes and elders, said,
Matthew|27|42|He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
Matthew|27|43|He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew|27|44|
Matthew|27|45|Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew|27|46|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew|27|47|And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.
Matthew|27|48|And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
Matthew|27|49|And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.
Matthew|27|50|And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew|27|51|And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;
Matthew|27|52|and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;
Matthew|27|53|and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
Matthew|27|54|Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew|27|55|And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Matthew|27|56|
Matthew|27|57|And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
Matthew|27|58|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
Matthew|27|59|And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew|27|60|and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
Matthew|27|61|
Matthew|27|62|after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,
Matthew|27|63|saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
Matthew|27|64|Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
Matthew|27|65|sure as ye can.
Matthew|27|66|
Matthew|28|1|of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew|28|2|And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
Matthew|28|3|His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew|28|4|and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.
Matthew|28|5|And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.
Matthew|28|6|He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Matthew|28|7|And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
Matthew|28|8|And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
Matthew|28|9|And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew|28|10|
Matthew|28|11|Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.
Matthew|28|12|And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,
Matthew|28|13|saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
Matthew|28|14|And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.
Matthew|28|15|
Matthew|28|16|But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew|28|17|; but some doubted.
Matthew|28|18|And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.
Matthew|28|19|Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:
Matthew|28|20|
Ezekiel|1|1|of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
Ezekiel|1|2|of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,
Ezekiel|1|3|the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
Ezekiel|1|4|And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
Ezekiel|1|5|And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
Ezekiel|1|6|And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
Ezekiel|1|7|And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.
Ezekiel|1|8|:
Ezekiel|1|9|their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel|1|10|As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|1|11|of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|12|And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|13|went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
Ezekiel|1|14|And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel|1|15|Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.
Ezekiel|1|16|The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
Ezekiel|1|17|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|18|As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
Ezekiel|1|19|And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
Ezekiel|1|20|Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel|1|21|When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel|1|22|And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.
Ezekiel|1|23|And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|24|And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|25|And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|26|And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.
Ezekiel|1|27|And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
Ezekiel|1|28|
Ezekiel|2|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
Ezekiel|2|2|And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.
Ezekiel|2|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.
Ezekiel|2|4|And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|2|5|And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
Ezekiel|2|6|And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|2|7|And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
Ezekiel|2|8|But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
Ezekiel|2|9|And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
Ezekiel|2|10|
Ezekiel|3|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|3|2|So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.
Ezekiel|3|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
Ezekiel|3|4|And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
Ezekiel|3|5|For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel|3|6|not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.
Ezekiel|3|7|But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
Ezekiel|3|8|Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
Ezekiel|3|9|As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|10|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
Ezekiel|3|11|And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
Ezekiel|3|12|, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
Ezekiel|3|13|the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
Ezekiel|3|14|So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
Ezekiel|3|15|Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
Ezekiel|3|16|And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|3|17|Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
Ezekiel|3|18|When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|19|Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|20|Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|21|Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|22|And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
Ezekiel|3|23|Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel|3|24|Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
Ezekiel|3|25|But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
Ezekiel|3|26|and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|27|
Ezekiel|4|1|Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:
Ezekiel|4|2|and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.
Ezekiel|4|3|And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|4|the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|4|5|For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|6|And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.
Ezekiel|4|7|And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.
Ezekiel|4|8|And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.
Ezekiel|4|9|the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.
Ezekiel|4|10|And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
Ezekiel|4|11|And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
Ezekiel|4|12|And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.
Ezekiel|4|13|And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.
Ezekiel|4|14|Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
Ezekiel|4|15|Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.
Ezekiel|4|16|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:
Ezekiel|4|17|
Ezekiel|5|1|a barber’s razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
Ezekiel|5|2|A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|3|And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
Ezekiel|5|4|And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|5|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.
Ezekiel|5|6|And she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected mine ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
Ezekiel|5|7|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;
Ezekiel|5|8|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|5|9|And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|5|10|Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.
Ezekiel|5|11|; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.
Ezekiel|5|12|A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|13|Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|5|14|Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
Ezekiel|5|15|So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Jehovah, have spoken it;)
Ezekiel|5|16|when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;
Ezekiel|5|17|
Ezekiel|6|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|6|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,
Ezekiel|6|3|and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
Ezekiel|6|4|And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.
Ezekiel|6|5|And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
Ezekiel|6|6|In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.
Ezekiel|6|7|And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|6|8|Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
Ezekiel|6|9|And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
Ezekiel|6|10|And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
Ezekiel|6|11|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Ezekiel|6|12|He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|6|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.
Ezekiel|6|14|
Ezekiel|7|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|7|2|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
Ezekiel|7|3|Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|4|And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|7|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|6|An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|7|joyful shouting, upon the mountains.
Ezekiel|7|8|Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|9|And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.
Ezekiel|7|10|Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
Ezekiel|7|11|, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.
Ezekiel|7|12|The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|13|For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
Ezekiel|7|14|They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|15|The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
Ezekiel|7|16|But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|17|All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel|7|18|They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
Ezekiel|7|19|They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|20|their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.
Ezekiel|7|21|And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.
Ezekiel|7|22|; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.
Ezekiel|7|23|Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel|7|24|Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
Ezekiel|7|25|Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
Ezekiel|7|26|Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
Ezekiel|7|27|
Ezekiel|8|1|of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
Ezekiel|8|2|Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
Ezekiel|8|3|that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
Ezekiel|8|4|And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
Ezekiel|8|5|Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
Ezekiel|8|6|And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.
Ezekiel|8|7|And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel|8|8|Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.
Ezekiel|8|9|And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.
Ezekiel|8|10|So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
Ezekiel|8|11|And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.
Ezekiel|8|12|Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.
Ezekiel|8|13|He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.
Ezekiel|8|14|Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel|8|15|, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.
Ezekiel|8|16|And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah’s house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.
Ezekiel|8|17|, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
Ezekiel|8|18|
Ezekiel|9|1|Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
Ezekiel|9|2|And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
Ezekiel|9|3|And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.
Ezekiel|9|4|And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|9|5|And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;
Ezekiel|9|6|slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.
Ezekiel|9|7|And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.
Ezekiel|9|8|And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
Ezekiel|9|9|: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.
Ezekiel|9|10|And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.
Ezekiel|9|11|
Ezekiel|10|1|Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
Ezekiel|10|2|, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
Ezekiel|10|3|Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
Ezekiel|10|4|over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.
Ezekiel|10|5|And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.
Ezekiel|10|6|And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|7|, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
Ezekiel|10|8|And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|9|And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.
Ezekiel|10|10|And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|11|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
Ezekiel|10|12|the wheels that they four had.
Ezekiel|10|13|.
Ezekiel|10|14|And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|10|15|And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
Ezekiel|10|16|And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.
Ezekiel|10|17|When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
Ezekiel|10|18|And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|19|And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|10|20|This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|21|Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|22|
Ezekiel|11|1|Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
Ezekiel|11|2|And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;
Ezekiel|11|3|is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
Ezekiel|11|4|Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
Ezekiel|11|5|And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
Ezekiel|11|6|Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
Ezekiel|11|7|is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.
Ezekiel|11|8|Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|9|And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
Ezekiel|11|10|Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|11|shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;
Ezekiel|11|12|and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.
Ezekiel|11|13|And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
Ezekiel|11|14|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|11|15|unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.
Ezekiel|11|16|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.
Ezekiel|11|17|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|11|18|And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
Ezekiel|11|19|And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;
Ezekiel|11|20|that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|11|21|But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|22|Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|11|23|And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel|11|24|And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
Ezekiel|11|25|
Ezekiel|12|1|The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|2|Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|3|Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|4|And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.
Ezekiel|12|5|Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
Ezekiel|12|6|In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|7|And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel|12|8|And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|9|Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
Ezekiel|12|10|the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.
Ezekiel|12|11|Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
Ezekiel|12|12|And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel|12|13|My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
Ezekiel|12|14|And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
Ezekiel|12|15|And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
Ezekiel|12|16|But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|17|Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|18|Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;
Ezekiel|12|19|of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
Ezekiel|12|20|And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|21|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|22|Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
Ezekiel|12|23|Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.
Ezekiel|12|24|For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|25|For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|26|Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|27|Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.
Ezekiel|12|28|
Ezekiel|13|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|13|2|Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|13|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel|13|4|O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
Ezekiel|13|5|Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|6|They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.
Ezekiel|13|7|Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?
Ezekiel|13|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|9|And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|10|:
Ezekiel|13|11|, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
Ezekiel|13|12|Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
Ezekiel|13|13|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
Ezekiel|13|14|, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|15|; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
Ezekiel|13|16|, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|17|And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
Ezekiel|13|18|every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
Ezekiel|13|19|And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.
Ezekiel|13|20|fly.
Ezekiel|13|21|Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|22|Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:
Ezekiel|13|23|
Ezekiel|14|1|Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|14|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|3|Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?
Ezekiel|14|4|Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;
Ezekiel|14|5|that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
Ezekiel|14|6|Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
Ezekiel|14|7|For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:
Ezekiel|14|8|and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|9|And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
Ezekiel|14|10|;
Ezekiel|14|11|that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|12|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|13|Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|14|though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|15|If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;
Ezekiel|14|16|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.
Ezekiel|14|17|Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|18|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.
Ezekiel|14|19|Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|20|though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
Ezekiel|14|21|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
Ezekiel|14|22|Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
Ezekiel|14|23|
Ezekiel|15|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|15|2|Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel|15|3|Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Ezekiel|15|4|Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?
Ezekiel|15|5|Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!
Ezekiel|15|6|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel|15|7|And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.
Ezekiel|15|8|
Ezekiel|16|1|Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|16|2|Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;
Ezekiel|16|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.
Ezekiel|16|4|And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
Ezekiel|16|5|No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.
Ezekiel|16|6|in thy blood, live.
Ezekiel|16|7|I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.
Ezekiel|16|8|Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine.
Ezekiel|16|9|Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
Ezekiel|16|10|I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.
Ezekiel|16|11|And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
Ezekiel|16|12|And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
Ezekiel|16|13|Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.
Ezekiel|16|14|And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|15|But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.
Ezekiel|16|16|.
Ezekiel|16|17|Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;
Ezekiel|16|18|and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
Ezekiel|16|19|it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|20|Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
Ezekiel|16|21|unto them?
Ezekiel|16|22|And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.
Ezekiel|16|23|And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah,)
Ezekiel|16|24|that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.
Ezekiel|16|25|Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.
Ezekiel|16|26|Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.
Ezekiel|16|27|, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.
Ezekiel|16|28|Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.
Ezekiel|16|29|Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
Ezekiel|16|30|How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot;
Ezekiel|16|31|in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire.
Ezekiel|16|32|A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband!
Ezekiel|16|33|They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|16|34|women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.
Ezekiel|16|35|Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|16|36|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;
Ezekiel|16|37|therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
Ezekiel|16|38|And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel|16|39|I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.
Ezekiel|16|40|They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
Ezekiel|16|41|And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.
Ezekiel|16|42|So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
Ezekiel|16|43|Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|16|44|proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
Ezekiel|16|45|Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
Ezekiel|16|46|And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
Ezekiel|16|47|, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
Ezekiel|16|48|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
Ezekiel|16|49|Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
Ezekiel|16|50|.
Ezekiel|16|51|Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.
Ezekiel|16|52|Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
Ezekiel|16|53|And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;
Ezekiel|16|54|that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
Ezekiel|16|55|And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
Ezekiel|16|56|For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
Ezekiel|16|57|before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.
Ezekiel|16|58|Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|59|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
Ezekiel|16|60|Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
Ezekiel|16|61|and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
Ezekiel|16|62|And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;
Ezekiel|16|63|
Ezekiel|17|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|17|2|Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
Ezekiel|17|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:
Ezekiel|17|4|he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel|17|5|He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.
Ezekiel|17|6|And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
Ezekiel|17|7|There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
Ezekiel|17|8|It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
Ezekiel|17|9|Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof.
Ezekiel|17|10|Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.
Ezekiel|17|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|17|12|Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon:
Ezekiel|17|13|and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;
Ezekiel|17|14|that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
Ezekiel|17|15|But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?
Ezekiel|17|16|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
Ezekiel|17|17|Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.
Ezekiel|17|18|For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.
Ezekiel|17|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.
Ezekiel|17|20|And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
Ezekiel|17|21|And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|17|22|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain:
Ezekiel|17|23|in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
Ezekiel|17|24|
Ezekiel|18|1|The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Ezekiel|18|2|What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?
Ezekiel|18|3|any more to use this proverb in Israel.
Ezekiel|18|4|Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
Ezekiel|18|5|But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
Ezekiel|18|6|and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity,
Ezekiel|18|7|and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
Ezekiel|18|8|he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,
Ezekiel|18|9|hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|18|10|If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things,
Ezekiel|18|11|, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor’s wife,
Ezekiel|18|12|hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,
Ezekiel|18|13|hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
Ezekiel|18|14|Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like;
Ezekiel|18|15|that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor’s wife,
Ezekiel|18|16|neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
Ezekiel|18|17|that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|18|18|As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.
Ezekiel|18|19|Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|18|20|The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
Ezekiel|18|21|But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|18|22|None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
Ezekiel|18|23|Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?
Ezekiel|18|24|But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
Ezekiel|18|25|Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
Ezekiel|18|26|When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
Ezekiel|18|27|Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
Ezekiel|18|28|Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|18|29|Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
Ezekiel|18|30|Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
Ezekiel|18|31|Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel|18|32|
Ezekiel|19|1|Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
Ezekiel|19|2|and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.
Ezekiel|19|3|And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
Ezekiel|19|4|The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|19|5|Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
Ezekiel|19|6|And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
Ezekiel|19|7|And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.
Ezekiel|19|8|Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
Ezekiel|19|9|And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel|19|10|Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
Ezekiel|19|11|And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.
Ezekiel|19|12|But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.
Ezekiel|19|13|And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
Ezekiel|19|14|
Ezekiel|20|1|of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|20|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|3|Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel|20|4|Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
Ezekiel|20|5|and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;
Ezekiel|20|6|in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
Ezekiel|20|7|And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|8|But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|9|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|10|So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|11|And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.
Ezekiel|20|12|Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.
Ezekiel|20|13|But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
Ezekiel|20|14|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
Ezekiel|20|15|Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
Ezekiel|20|16|because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
Ezekiel|20|17|Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|18|And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel|20|19|I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
Ezekiel|20|20|and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|21|But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|22|Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
Ezekiel|20|23|Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
Ezekiel|20|24|because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
Ezekiel|20|25|Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live;
Ezekiel|20|26|all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|27|Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
Ezekiel|20|28|For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.
Ezekiel|20|29|Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
Ezekiel|20|30|Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations?
Ezekiel|20|31|and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you;
Ezekiel|20|32|and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
Ezekiel|20|33|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you:
Ezekiel|20|34|and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;
Ezekiel|20|35|and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.
Ezekiel|20|36|Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|37|And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
Ezekiel|20|38|and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|39|As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.
Ezekiel|20|40|For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
Ezekiel|20|41|As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|20|42|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers.
Ezekiel|20|43|And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
Ezekiel|20|44|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|45|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|46|toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;
Ezekiel|20|47|and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt thereby.
Ezekiel|20|48|And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Ezekiel|20|49|
Ezekiel|21|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|2|toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|21|3|and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel|21|4|Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
Ezekiel|21|5|and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
Ezekiel|21|6|Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.
Ezekiel|21|7|And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|9|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;
Ezekiel|21|10|it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.
Ezekiel|21|11|And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel|21|12|Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.
Ezekiel|21|13|For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|14|Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.
Ezekiel|21|15|I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
Ezekiel|21|16|Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
Ezekiel|21|17|I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|21|18|The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Ezekiel|21|19|Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
Ezekiel|21|20|Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
Ezekiel|21|21|For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.
Ezekiel|21|22|Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
Ezekiel|21|23|And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
Ezekiel|21|24|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
Ezekiel|21|25|And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
Ezekiel|21|26|no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
Ezekiel|21|27|.
Ezekiel|21|28|And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;
Ezekiel|21|29|while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
Ezekiel|21|30|Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.
Ezekiel|21|31|And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.
Ezekiel|21|32|
Ezekiel|22|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|2|And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations.
Ezekiel|22|3|And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that maketh idols against herself to defile her!
Ezekiel|22|4|Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.
Ezekiel|22|5|full of tumult.
Ezekiel|22|6|Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.
Ezekiel|22|7|In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel|22|8|Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|22|9|Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness.
Ezekiel|22|10|In thee have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity.
Ezekiel|22|11|And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.
Ezekiel|22|12|In thee have they taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|22|13|Behold, therefore, I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
Ezekiel|22|14|Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it.
Ezekiel|22|15|And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
Ezekiel|22|16|And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|22|17|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|18|Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
Ezekiel|22|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel|22|20|As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.
Ezekiel|22|21|Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|22|22|As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you.
Ezekiel|22|23|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|24|Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
Ezekiel|22|25|There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|22|26|Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
Ezekiel|22|27|to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.
Ezekiel|22|28|, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken.
Ezekiel|22|29|The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.
Ezekiel|22|30|And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.
Ezekiel|22|31|
Ezekiel|23|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|23|2|Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
Ezekiel|23|3|and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.
Ezekiel|23|4|And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
Ezekiel|23|5|neighbors,
Ezekiel|23|6|who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
Ezekiel|23|7|And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.
Ezekiel|23|8|Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.
Ezekiel|23|9|Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
Ezekiel|23|10|These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.
Ezekiel|23|11|And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.
Ezekiel|23|12|neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
Ezekiel|23|13|And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.
Ezekiel|23|14|And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
Ezekiel|23|15|girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
Ezekiel|23|16|And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
Ezekiel|23|17|And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.
Ezekiel|23|18|So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.
Ezekiel|23|19|Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|23|20|And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Ezekiel|23|21|Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.
Ezekiel|23|22|Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:
Ezekiel|23|23|all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.
Ezekiel|23|24|And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
Ezekiel|23|25|And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
Ezekiel|23|26|They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
Ezekiel|23|27|from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
Ezekiel|23|28|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;
Ezekiel|23|29|and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|23|30|These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
Ezekiel|23|31|Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.
Ezekiel|23|32|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
Ezekiel|23|33|Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
Ezekiel|23|34|Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|23|35|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|23|36|Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.
Ezekiel|23|37|unto them to be devoured.
Ezekiel|23|38|Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|23|39|For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
Ezekiel|23|40|And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,
Ezekiel|23|41|and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.
Ezekiel|23|42|, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
Ezekiel|23|43|.
Ezekiel|23|44|And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.
Ezekiel|23|45|And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
Ezekiel|23|46|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.
Ezekiel|23|47|And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
Ezekiel|23|48|Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
Ezekiel|23|49|
Ezekiel|24|1|of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|2|of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.
Ezekiel|24|3|And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:
Ezekiel|24|4|gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
Ezekiel|24|5|; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.
Ezekiel|24|6|Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.
Ezekiel|24|7|For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel|24|8|That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
Ezekiel|24|9|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel|24|10|Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.
Ezekiel|24|11|Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.
Ezekiel|24|12|by fire.
Ezekiel|24|13|In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.
Ezekiel|24|14|I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|24|15|Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|16|Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
Ezekiel|24|17|Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.
Ezekiel|24|18|So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
Ezekiel|24|19|And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?
Ezekiel|24|20|Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|21|Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel|24|22|And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel|24|23|And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
Ezekiel|24|24|Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|24|25|And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,
Ezekiel|24|26|that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?
Ezekiel|24|27|
Ezekiel|25|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|25|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:
Ezekiel|25|3|and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:
Ezekiel|25|4|therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
Ezekiel|25|5|And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|6|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|25|7|therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|8|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;
Ezekiel|25|9|therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
Ezekiel|25|10|against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
Ezekiel|25|11|and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|12|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
Ezekiel|25|13|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
Ezekiel|25|14|And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;
Ezekiel|25|16|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
Ezekiel|25|17|
Ezekiel|26|1|of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|26|2|the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:
Ezekiel|26|3|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
Ezekiel|26|4|And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel|26|5|She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
Ezekiel|26|6|And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|7|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people.
Ezekiel|26|8|He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.
Ezekiel|26|9|And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
Ezekiel|26|10|By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
Ezekiel|26|11|With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.
Ezekiel|26|12|And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
Ezekiel|26|13|And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
Ezekiel|26|14|And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
Ezekiel|26|16|Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.
Ezekiel|26|17|And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there!
Ezekiel|26|18|Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.
Ezekiel|26|19|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;
Ezekiel|26|20|then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living:
Ezekiel|26|21|
Ezekiel|27|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|27|2|And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
Ezekiel|27|3|and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|27|4|Thy borders are in the heart of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|5|They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
Ezekiel|27|6|Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.
Ezekiel|27|7|Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.
Ezekiel|27|8|The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots.
Ezekiel|27|9|The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|10|Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
Ezekiel|27|11|The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|12|Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.
Ezekiel|27|13|Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|14|They of the house of Togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules.
Ezekiel|27|15|The men of Dedan were thy traffickers; many isles were the mart of thy hand: they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony.
Ezekiel|27|16|Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of thy handiworks: they traded for thy wares with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies.
Ezekiel|27|17|Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy traffickers: they traded for thy merchandise wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
Ezekiel|27|18|Damascus was thy merchant for the multitude of thy handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
Ezekiel|27|19|Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for thy wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|20|Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding.
Ezekiel|27|21|Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were they thy merchants.
Ezekiel|27|22|The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; they traded for thy wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
Ezekiel|27|23|Chilmad, were thy traffickers.
Ezekiel|27|24|These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|25|The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|27|26|Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|27|27|Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
Ezekiel|27|28|At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.
Ezekiel|27|29|all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,
Ezekiel|27|30|and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
Ezekiel|27|31|and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.
Ezekiel|27|32|, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
Ezekiel|27|33|When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|34|In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee.
Ezekiel|27|35|All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.
Ezekiel|27|36|
Ezekiel|28|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|2|Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of God;-
Ezekiel|28|3|behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee;
Ezekiel|28|4|by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;
Ezekiel|28|5|by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;-
Ezekiel|28|6|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God,
Ezekiel|28|7|therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
Ezekiel|28|8|They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|28|9|Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.
Ezekiel|28|10|Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|12|Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|28|13|Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared.
Ezekiel|28|14|thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|15|Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.
Ezekiel|28|16|By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|17|Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|18|By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|19|All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.
Ezekiel|28|20|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|21|Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel|28|22|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
Ezekiel|28|23|For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|24|And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|25|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
Ezekiel|28|26|
Ezekiel|29|1|of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|29|2|Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;
Ezekiel|29|3|speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.
Ezekiel|29|4|And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.
Ezekiel|29|5|And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.
Ezekiel|29|6|And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|29|7|When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
Ezekiel|29|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.
Ezekiel|29|9|And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;
Ezekiel|29|10|therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.
Ezekiel|29|11|No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
Ezekiel|29|12|And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|29|13|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;
Ezekiel|29|14|and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
Ezekiel|29|15|It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
Ezekiel|29|16|And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|17|of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|29|18|Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
Ezekiel|29|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
Ezekiel|29|20|I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|21|
Ezekiel|30|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|2|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!
Ezekiel|30|3|For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
Ezekiel|30|4|And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
Ezekiel|30|5|Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
Ezekiel|30|6|Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|7|And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
Ezekiel|30|8|And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.
Ezekiel|30|9|In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.
Ezekiel|30|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel|30|11|He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
Ezekiel|30|12|And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|30|13|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|14|And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.
Ezekiel|30|15|And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
Ezekiel|30|16|adversaries in the day-time.
Ezekiel|30|17|shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|18|At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|19|Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|20|of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|21|medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
Ezekiel|30|22|, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
Ezekiel|30|23|And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|30|24|And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
Ezekiel|30|25|And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|26|
Ezekiel|31|1|of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|31|2|Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
Ezekiel|31|3|Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.
Ezekiel|31|4|The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.
Ezekiel|31|5|forth.
Ezekiel|31|6|All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
Ezekiel|31|7|Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.
Ezekiel|31|8|The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.
Ezekiel|31|9|I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
Ezekiel|31|10|Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
Ezekiel|31|11|I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.
Ezekiel|31|12|And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
Ezekiel|31|13|Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;
Ezekiel|31|14|all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|31|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
Ezekiel|31|16|I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
Ezekiel|31|17|dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
Ezekiel|31|18|
Ezekiel|32|1|of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|2|Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.
Ezekiel|32|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.
Ezekiel|32|4|And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
Ezekiel|32|5|And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.
Ezekiel|32|6|I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.
Ezekiel|32|7|And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
Ezekiel|32|8|All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|9|I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
Ezekiel|32|10|Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
Ezekiel|32|11|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
Ezekiel|32|12|By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
Ezekiel|32|13|I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
Ezekiel|32|14|Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|15|When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|16|This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|17|of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|18|Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
Ezekiel|32|19|Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
Ezekiel|32|20|They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.
Ezekiel|32|21|The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|22|Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
Ezekiel|32|23|whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|24|There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|25|They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.
Ezekiel|32|26|There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|27|the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|28|But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|29|There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|30|There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|31|Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|32|
Ezekiel|33|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|33|2|Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
Ezekiel|33|3|if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
Ezekiel|33|4|then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
Ezekiel|33|5|He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.
Ezekiel|33|6|But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.
Ezekiel|33|7|So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
Ezekiel|33|8|When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|33|9|Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|33|10|And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?
Ezekiel|33|11|Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel|33|12|And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.
Ezekiel|33|13|When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.
Ezekiel|33|14|Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
Ezekiel|33|15|if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|33|16|None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|33|17|Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
Ezekiel|33|18|When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.
Ezekiel|33|19|And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
Ezekiel|33|20|Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
Ezekiel|33|21|of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
Ezekiel|33|22|Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
Ezekiel|33|23|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|33|24|Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
Ezekiel|33|25|Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?
Ezekiel|33|26|Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?
Ezekiel|33|27|Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
Ezekiel|33|28|And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
Ezekiel|33|29|Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel|33|30|And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.
Ezekiel|33|31|And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.
Ezekiel|33|32|And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.
Ezekiel|33|33|
Ezekiel|34|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|34|2|Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?
Ezekiel|34|3|Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep.
Ezekiel|34|4|The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.
Ezekiel|34|5|And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
Ezekiel|34|6|.
Ezekiel|34|7|Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|34|8|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep;
Ezekiel|34|9|therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|34|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
Ezekiel|34|11|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
Ezekiel|34|12|As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
Ezekiel|34|13|And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
Ezekiel|34|14|I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel|34|15|I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|34|16|I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.
Ezekiel|34|17|And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.
Ezekiel|34|18|Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
Ezekiel|34|19|And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
Ezekiel|34|20|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Ezekiel|34|21|Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
Ezekiel|34|22|therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
Ezekiel|34|23|And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
Ezekiel|34|24|And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|34|25|And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
Ezekiel|34|26|And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel|34|27|And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them.
Ezekiel|34|28|And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
Ezekiel|34|29|And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.
Ezekiel|34|30|And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|34|31|
Ezekiel|35|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|35|2|Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel|35|3|and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.
Ezekiel|35|4|I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|35|5|Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
Ezekiel|35|6|therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
Ezekiel|35|7|Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth.
Ezekiel|35|8|And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
Ezekiel|35|9|I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|35|10|Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there:
Ezekiel|35|11|therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.
Ezekiel|35|12|And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
Ezekiel|35|13|And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.
Ezekiel|35|14|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
Ezekiel|35|15|
Ezekiel|36|1|And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|2|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;
Ezekiel|36|3|therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;
Ezekiel|36|4|therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;
Ezekiel|36|5|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.
Ezekiel|36|6|Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations:
Ezekiel|36|7|, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.
Ezekiel|36|8|But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.
Ezekiel|36|9|For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;
Ezekiel|36|10|and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;
Ezekiel|36|11|than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|12|Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.
Ezekiel|36|13|art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation;
Ezekiel|36|14|therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;
Ezekiel|36|15|neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|16|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|36|17|Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
Ezekiel|36|18|Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;
Ezekiel|36|19|and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
Ezekiel|36|20|And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.
Ezekiel|36|21|But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went.
Ezekiel|36|22|for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went.
Ezekiel|36|23|And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
Ezekiel|36|24|For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel|36|25|And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
Ezekiel|36|26|A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel|36|27|And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.
Ezekiel|36|28|And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Ezekiel|36|29|And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.
Ezekiel|36|30|And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel|36|31|Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
Ezekiel|36|32|, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
Ezekiel|36|33|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
Ezekiel|36|34|And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.
Ezekiel|36|35|And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
Ezekiel|36|36|Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
Ezekiel|36|37|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.
Ezekiel|36|38|
Ezekiel|37|1|The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Ezekiel|37|2|And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
Ezekiel|37|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.
Ezekiel|37|4|Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.
Ezekiel|37|6|And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|7|So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
Ezekiel|37|8|And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
Ezekiel|37|9|Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
Ezekiel|37|10|So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
Ezekiel|37|11|Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
Ezekiel|37|12|Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|37|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
Ezekiel|37|14|And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|15|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|37|16|all the house of Israel his companions:
Ezekiel|37|17|and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.
Ezekiel|37|18|And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?
Ezekiel|37|19|with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
Ezekiel|37|20|And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel|37|21|And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
Ezekiel|37|22|and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
Ezekiel|37|23|neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|37|24|And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
Ezekiel|37|25|And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
Ezekiel|37|26|Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
Ezekiel|37|27|My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Ezekiel|37|28|
Ezekiel|38|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|38|2|Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
Ezekiel|38|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|38|4|and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
Ezekiel|38|5|Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel|38|6|Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|7|Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
Ezekiel|38|8|After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
Ezekiel|38|9|And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device:
Ezekiel|38|11|and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
Ezekiel|38|12|inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.
Ezekiel|38|13|Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?
Ezekiel|38|14|Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?
Ezekiel|38|15|And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;
Ezekiel|38|16|and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
Ezekiel|38|17|years that I would bring thee against them?
Ezekiel|38|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.
Ezekiel|38|19|For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|38|20|so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
Ezekiel|38|21|And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.
Ezekiel|38|22|And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
Ezekiel|38|23|
Ezekiel|39|1|And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|39|2|and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;
Ezekiel|39|3|and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
Ezekiel|39|4|Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
Ezekiel|39|5|Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|6|And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|7|And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel|39|8|Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
Ezekiel|39|9|And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;
Ezekiel|39|10|so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|11|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|12|And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|13|Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|14|And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
Ezekiel|39|15|And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|16|And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|17|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel|39|18|Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
Ezekiel|39|19|And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
Ezekiel|39|20|And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|21|And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
Ezekiel|39|22|So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.
Ezekiel|39|23|And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
Ezekiel|39|24|According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.
Ezekiel|39|25|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
Ezekiel|39|26|And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
Ezekiel|39|27|when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
Ezekiel|39|28|And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;
Ezekiel|39|29|
Ezekiel|40|1|of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.
Ezekiel|40|2|In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.
Ezekiel|40|3|And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
Ezekiel|40|4|And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|40|5|And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Ezekiel|40|6|Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
Ezekiel|40|7|between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.
Ezekiel|40|8|He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
Ezekiel|40|9|Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.
Ezekiel|40|10|And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
Ezekiel|40|11|And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
Ezekiel|40|12|, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
Ezekiel|40|13|And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.

Ezekiel|40|16|post were palm-trees.
Ezekiel|40|17|Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
Ezekiel|40|18|And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
Ezekiel|40|19|on the east and on the north.
Ezekiel|40|20|And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.
Ezekiel|40|21|And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|22|And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
Ezekiel|40|23|on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|40|24|And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
Ezekiel|40|25|And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|26|And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
Ezekiel|40|27|And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|40|28|Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;

Ezekiel|40|36|the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|37|And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
Ezekiel|40|38|And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.
Ezekiel|40|39|And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.
Ezekiel|40|40|side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.
Ezekiel|40|41|.
Ezekiel|40|42|And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
Ezekiel|40|43|And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.
Ezekiel|40|44|And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
Ezekiel|40|45|And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;
Ezekiel|40|46|and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.
Ezekiel|40|47|And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.
Ezekiel|40|48|Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
Ezekiel|40|49|
Ezekiel|41|1|And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
Ezekiel|41|2|And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|41|3|Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.
Ezekiel|41|4|And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
Ezekiel|41|5|Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
Ezekiel|41|6|, and not have hold in the wall of the house.
Ezekiel|41|7|.
Ezekiel|41|8|I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
Ezekiel|41|9|The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.
Ezekiel|41|10|And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
Ezekiel|41|11|that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
Ezekiel|41|12|And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
Ezekiel|41|13|So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;
Ezekiel|41|14|also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|41|15|And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
Ezekiel|41|16|the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),
Ezekiel|41|17|above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
Ezekiel|41|18|And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
Ezekiel|41|19|made through all the house round about:
Ezekiel|41|20|from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.
Ezekiel|41|21|.
Ezekiel|41|22|The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.
Ezekiel|41|23|And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
Ezekiel|41|24|for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
Ezekiel|41|25|And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.
Ezekiel|41|26|
Ezekiel|42|1|Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.
Ezekiel|42|2|Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel|42|3|which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.
Ezekiel|42|4|And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits’ breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
Ezekiel|42|5|Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.
Ezekiel|42|6|was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
Ezekiel|42|7|And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel|42|8|For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|42|9|And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
Ezekiel|42|10|In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.
Ezekiel|42|11|the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
Ezekiel|42|12|And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
Ezekiel|42|13|Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.
Ezekiel|42|14|When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.
Ezekiel|42|15|Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
Ezekiel|42|16|He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel|42|17|He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel|42|18|He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel|42|19|He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel|42|20|
Ezekiel|43|1|Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|2|And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.
Ezekiel|43|3|And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel|43|4|And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|5|And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
Ezekiel|43|6|And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
Ezekiel|43|7|their high places;
Ezekiel|43|8|the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
Ezekiel|43|9|Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
Ezekiel|43|10|Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
Ezekiel|43|11|And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
Ezekiel|43|12|This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
Ezekiel|43|13|And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.
Ezekiel|43|14|And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
Ezekiel|43|15|And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
Ezekiel|43|16|long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.
Ezekiel|43|17|long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|18|And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
Ezekiel|43|19|Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
Ezekiel|43|20|And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel|43|21|Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|43|22|And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
Ezekiel|43|23|When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|24|And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezekiel|43|25|Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|26|Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
Ezekiel|43|27|
Ezekiel|44|1|Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
Ezekiel|44|2|And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
Ezekiel|44|3|As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
Ezekiel|44|4|Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel|44|5|And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|44|6|And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
Ezekiel|44|7|unto all your abominations.
Ezekiel|44|8|And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
Ezekiel|44|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.
Ezekiel|44|10|But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|11|Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
Ezekiel|44|12|Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|13|And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel|44|14|Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
Ezekiel|44|15|But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah:
Ezekiel|44|16|they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
Ezekiel|44|17|And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
Ezekiel|44|18|sweat.
Ezekiel|44|19|And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments.
Ezekiel|44|20|Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
Ezekiel|44|21|Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
Ezekiel|44|22|Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.
Ezekiel|44|23|And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
Ezekiel|44|24|And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|44|25|And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.
Ezekiel|44|26|And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
Ezekiel|44|27|And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|44|28|And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
Ezekiel|44|29|They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
Ezekiel|44|30|And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.
Ezekiel|44|31|
Ezekiel|45|1|, and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|2|, square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|3|And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.
Ezekiel|45|4|It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|45|5|twenty chambers.
Ezekiel|45|6|And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
Ezekiel|45|7|on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.
Ezekiel|45|8|In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Ezekiel|45|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|10|Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
Ezekiel|45|11|The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
Ezekiel|45|12|And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
Ezekiel|45|13|This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;
Ezekiel|45|14|ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)
Ezekiel|45|15|and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|16|All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel|45|17|And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|45|18|of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|45|19|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
Ezekiel|45|20|of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.
Ezekiel|45|21|, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
Ezekiel|45|22|And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.
Ezekiel|45|23|And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.
Ezekiel|45|24|And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|45|25|
Ezekiel|46|1|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
Ezekiel|46|2|And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
Ezekiel|46|3|And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
Ezekiel|46|4|And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
Ezekiel|46|5|and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|6|And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:
Ezekiel|46|7|and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|8|And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
Ezekiel|46|9|But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.
Ezekiel|46|10|.
Ezekiel|46|11|And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|12|And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
Ezekiel|46|13|And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.
Ezekiel|46|14|And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.
Ezekiel|46|15|Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.
Ezekiel|46|16|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
Ezekiel|46|17|But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.
Ezekiel|46|18|Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
Ezekiel|46|19|Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
Ezekiel|46|20|where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
Ezekiel|46|21|Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
Ezekiel|46|22|long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.
Ezekiel|46|23|And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
Ezekiel|46|24|
Ezekiel|47|1|And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.
Ezekiel|47|2|that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
Ezekiel|47|3|When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
Ezekiel|47|4|, waters that were to the loins.
Ezekiel|47|5|a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
Ezekiel|47|6|? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
Ezekiel|47|7|Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
Ezekiel|47|8|which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.
Ezekiel|47|9|shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh.
Ezekiel|47|10|And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
Ezekiel|47|11|But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
Ezekiel|47|12|And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.
Ezekiel|47|13|portions.
Ezekiel|47|14|And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
Ezekiel|47|15|And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad;
Ezekiel|47|16|Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
Ezekiel|47|17|And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
Ezekiel|47|18|border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side.
Ezekiel|47|19|, unto the great sea. This is the south side southward.
Ezekiel|47|20|border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.
Ezekiel|47|21|So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel|47|22|And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

1 Chronicles|12|40|
1 Chronicles|13|1|And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
1 Chronicles|13|2|And David said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of Jehovah our God, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us;
1 Chronicles|13|3|and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.
1 Chronicles|13|4|And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1 Chronicles|13|5|of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
1 Chronicles|13|6|the cherubim, that is called by the Name.
1 Chronicles|13|7|out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
1 Chronicles|13|8|
1 Chronicles|13|9|And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
1 Chronicles|13|10|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before God.
1 Chronicles|13|11|And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day.
1 Chronicles|13|12|And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
1 Chronicles|13|13|So David removed not the ark unto him into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
1 Chronicles|13|14|

1 Chronicles|14|7|
1 Chronicles|14|8|And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.
1 Chronicles|14|9|Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles|14|10|And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.
1 Chronicles|14|11|So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
1 Chronicles|14|12|
1 Chronicles|14|13|And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
1 Chronicles|14|14|And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
1 Chronicles|14|15|And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles|14|16|And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
1 Chronicles|14|17|
1 Chronicles|15|1|made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
1 Chronicles|15|2|Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
1 Chronicles|15|3|And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah unto its place, which he had prepared for it.

1 Chronicles|15|12|that I have prepared for it.
1 Chronicles|15|13|not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.
1 Chronicles|15|14|So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles|15|15|
1 Chronicles|15|16|And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.

1 Chronicles|15|18|and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.

1 Chronicles|15|26|And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.
1 Chronicles|15|27|the singers: and David had upon him an ephod of linen.
1 Chronicles|15|28|
1 Chronicles|15|29|
1 Chronicles|16|1|And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
1 Chronicles|16|2|And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|16|3|
1 Chronicles|16|4|And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:

1 Chronicles|16|39|and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,
1 Chronicles|16|40|to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;

1 Chronicles|17|2|And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.
1 Chronicles|17|3|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1 Chronicles|17|4|Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
1 Chronicles|17|5|.
1 Chronicles|17|6|In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
1 Chronicles|17|7|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:
1 Chronicles|17|8|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
1 Chronicles|17|9|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
1 Chronicles|17|10|from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.
1 Chronicles|17|11|And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1 Chronicles|17|12|He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|13|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
1 Chronicles|17|14|but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
1 Chronicles|17|15|
1 Chronicles|17|16|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
1 Chronicles|17|17|And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
1 Chronicles|17|18|yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
1 Chronicles|17|19|great things.
1 Chronicles|17|20|O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
1 Chronicles|17|21|And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?
1 Chronicles|17|22|For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
1 Chronicles|17|23|And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
1 Chronicles|17|24|And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.

1 Chronicles|18|1|And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles|18|2|
1 Chronicles|18|3|And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
1 Chronicles|18|4|
1 Chronicles|18|5|And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1 Chronicles|18|6|in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
1 Chronicles|18|7|And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|18|8|
1 Chronicles|18|9|And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
1 Chronicles|18|10|all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
1 Chronicles|18|11|
1 Chronicles|18|12|Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
1 Chronicles|18|13|
1 Chronicles|18|14|And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
1 Chronicles|18|15|And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
1 Chronicles|18|16|and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1 Chronicles|18|17|
1 Chronicles|19|1|And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles|19|2|And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1 Chronicles|19|3|But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
1 Chronicles|19|4|So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
1 Chronicles|19|5|
1 Chronicles|19|6|And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
1 Chronicles|19|7|So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
1 Chronicles|19|8|And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1 Chronicles|19|9|
1 Chronicles|19|10|Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles|19|11|And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1 Chronicles|19|12|And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
1 Chronicles|19|13|Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
1 Chronicles|19|14|So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles|19|15|
1 Chronicles|19|16|And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
1 Chronicles|19|17|And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1 Chronicles|19|18|seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
1 Chronicles|19|19|
1 Chronicles|20|1|, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.
1 Chronicles|20|2|And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
1 Chronicles|20|3|
1 Chronicles|20|4|And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
1 Chronicles|20|5|And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
1 Chronicles|20|6|; and he also was born unto the giant.
1 Chronicles|20|7|And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.
1 Chronicles|20|8|
1 Chronicles|21|1|And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles|21|2|And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.
1 Chronicles|21|3|And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?
1 Chronicles|21|4|Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles|21|5|And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
1 Chronicles|21|6|But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1 Chronicles|21|7|And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
1 Chronicles|21|8|
1 Chronicles|21|9|And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,
1 Chronicles|21|10|Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
1 Chronicles|21|11|So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:
1 Chronicles|21|12|either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
1 Chronicles|21|13|And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
1 Chronicles|21|14|So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
1 Chronicles|21|15|And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles|21|16|And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
1 Chronicles|21|17|
1 Chronicles|21|18|Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles|21|19|And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|21|20|And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1 Chronicles|21|21|And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1 Chronicles|21|22|Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
1 Chronicles|21|23|the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.
1 Chronicles|21|24|And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.
1 Chronicles|21|25|So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1 Chronicles|21|26|And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
1 Chronicles|21|27|
1 Chronicles|21|28|At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
1 Chronicles|21|29|For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles|21|30|
1 Chronicles|22|1|Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.
1 Chronicles|22|2|And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1 Chronicles|22|3|And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;
1 Chronicles|22|4|and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.
1 Chronicles|22|5|
1 Chronicles|22|6|Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles|22|7|And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.
1 Chronicles|22|8|But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
1 Chronicles|22|9|Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days:
1 Chronicles|22|10|he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1 Chronicles|22|11|Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.
1 Chronicles|22|12|Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.
1 Chronicles|22|13|Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.
1 Chronicles|22|14|Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
1 Chronicles|22|15|Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:
1 Chronicles|22|16|
1 Chronicles|22|17|,
1 Chronicles|22|18|Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
1 Chronicles|22|19|

2 Samuel|1|15|And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him, so that he died.
2 Samuel|1|16|
2 Samuel|1|17|And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son

2 Samuel|2|1|And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|2|So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
2 Samuel|2|3|And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2 Samuel|2|4|And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.
2 Samuel|2|5|And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
2 Samuel|2|6|And now Jehovah show lovingkindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
2 Samuel|2|7|
2 Samuel|2|8|Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
2 Samuel|2|9|and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
2 Samuel|2|10|Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel|2|11|
2 Samuel|2|12|And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|13|And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
2 Samuel|2|14|And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
2 Samuel|2|15|Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
2 Samuel|2|16|his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|17|
2 Samuel|2|18|And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2 Samuel|2|19|And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2 Samuel|2|20|Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it thou, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.
2 Samuel|2|21|And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
2 Samuel|2|22|And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
2 Samuel|2|23|
2 Samuel|2|24|But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2 Samuel|2|25|And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
2 Samuel|2|26|Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
2 Samuel|2|27|And Joab said, As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.
2 Samuel|2|28|So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
2 Samuel|2|29|
2 Samuel|2|30|And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.
2 Samuel|2|31|three hundred and threescore men died.
2 Samuel|2|32|
2 Samuel|3|1|
2 Samuel|3|2|And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
2 Samuel|3|3|and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
2 Samuel|3|4|and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
2 Samuel|3|5|
2 Samuel|3|6|And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
2 Samuel|3|7|said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?
2 Samuel|3|8|Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongeth to Judah? This day do I show kindness unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David; and yet thou chargest me this day with a fault concerning this woman.
2 Samuel|3|9|God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah hath sworn to David, I do not even so to him;
2 Samuel|3|10|to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|3|11|
2 Samuel|3|12|, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
2 Samuel|3|13|And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee; but one thing I require of thee: that is, thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
2 Samuel|3|14|And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|3|15|And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish.
2 Samuel|3|16|
2 Samuel|3|17|And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past ye sought for David to be king over you:
2 Samuel|3|18|now then do it; for Jehovah hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
2 Samuel|3|19|And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel|3|20|So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.
2 Samuel|3|21|
2 Samuel|3|22|And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|23|When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
2 Samuel|3|24|Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
2 Samuel|3|25|Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
2 Samuel|3|26|
2 Samuel|3|27|And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
2 Samuel|3|28|And afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
2 Samuel|3|29|let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread.
2 Samuel|3|30|
2 Samuel|3|31|And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
2 Samuel|3|32|And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
2 Samuel|3|33|
2 Samuel|3|34|And all the people wept again over him.
2 Samuel|3|35|And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David sware, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or aught else, till the sun be down.
2 Samuel|3|36|And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
2 Samuel|3|37|So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
2 Samuel|3|38|And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
2 Samuel|3|39|
2 Samuel|4|1|, Saul’s son, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
2 Samuel|4|2|two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
2 Samuel|4|3|
2 Samuel|4|4|
2 Samuel|4|5|And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
2 Samuel|4|6|And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2 Samuel|4|7|Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
2 Samuel|4|8|And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
2 Samuel|4|9|And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
2 Samuel|4|10|when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings.
2 Samuel|4|11|How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
2 Samuel|4|12|
2 Samuel|5|1|Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2 Samuel|5|2|In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|3|So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah: and they anointed David king over Israel.
2 Samuel|5|4|David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
2 Samuel|5|5|
2 Samuel|5|6|And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David cannot come in hither.
2 Samuel|5|7|Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
2 Samuel|5|8|the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul. Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.
2 Samuel|5|9|And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
2 Samuel|5|10|
2 Samuel|5|11|And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
2 Samuel|5|12|
2 Samuel|5|13|And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
2 Samuel|5|14|And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
2 Samuel|5|15|and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
2 Samuel|5|16|
2 Samuel|5|17|And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
2 Samuel|5|18|Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|19|And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
2 Samuel|5|20|And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
2 Samuel|5|21|
2 Samuel|5|22|And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|5|23|And when David inquired of Jehovah, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
2 Samuel|5|24|And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is Jehovah gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
2 Samuel|5|25|
2 Samuel|6|1|And David again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
2 Samuel|6|2|the cherubim.
2 Samuel|6|3|And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
2 Samuel|6|4|And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
2 Samuel|6|5|
2 Samuel|6|6|to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.
2 Samuel|6|7|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
2 Samuel|6|8|And David was displeased, because Jehovah had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.
2 Samuel|6|9|And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come unto me?
2 Samuel|6|10|So David would not remove the ark of Jehovah unto him into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
2 Samuel|6|11|
2 Samuel|6|12|And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.
2 Samuel|6|13|And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
2 Samuel|6|14|And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
2 Samuel|6|15|
2 Samuel|6|16|And it was so, as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
2 Samuel|6|17|And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|18|And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
2 Samuel|6|19|
2 Samuel|6|20|Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
2 Samuel|6|21|before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: therefore will I play before Jehovah.
2 Samuel|6|22|And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.
2 Samuel|6|23|
2 Samuel|7|1|And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
2 Samuel|7|2|that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
2 Samuel|7|3|And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee.
2 Samuel|7|4|And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Jehovah came unto Nathan, saying,
2 Samuel|7|5|Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
2 Samuel|7|6|for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
2 Samuel|7|7|In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
2 Samuel|7|8|Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel;
2 Samuel|7|9|and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
2 Samuel|7|10|And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,
2 Samuel|7|11|from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.
2 Samuel|7|12|When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel|7|13|He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
2 Samuel|7|14|I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;
2 Samuel|7|15|but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
2 Samuel|7|16|And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
2 Samuel|7|17|
2 Samuel|7|18|Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
2 Samuel|7|19|after the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah!
2 Samuel|7|20|And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord Jehovah.
2 Samuel|7|21|For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.
2 Samuel|7|22|Wherefore thou art great, O Jehovah God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
2 Samuel|7|23|the nations and their gods?
2 Samuel|7|24|And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
2 Samuel|7|25|And now, O Jehovah God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
2 Samuel|7|26|And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of thy servant David shall be established before thee.
2 Samuel|7|27|For thou, O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
2 Samuel|7|28|And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art God, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
2 Samuel|7|29|
2 Samuel|8|1|
2 Samuel|8|2|
2 Samuel|8|3|David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.
2 Samuel|8|4|And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
2 Samuel|8|5|And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|6|Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
2 Samuel|8|7|And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|8|8|And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
2 Samuel|8|9|And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
2 Samuel|8|10|brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
2 Samuel|8|11|These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;
2 Samuel|8|12|
2 Samuel|8|13|And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men.
2 Samuel|8|14|
2 Samuel|8|15|And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
2 Samuel|8|16|And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
2 Samuel|8|17|and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
2 Samuel|8|18|
2 Samuel|9|1|And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
2 Samuel|9|2|And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
2 Samuel|9|3|And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame of his feet.
2 Samuel|9|4|And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|5|Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
2 Samuel|9|6|And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and did obeisance. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold, thy servant!
2 Samuel|9|7|And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
2 Samuel|9|8|
2 Samuel|9|9|Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.
2 Samuel|9|10|, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2 Samuel|9|11|, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|9|12|And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel|9|13|
2 Samuel|10|1|And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2 Samuel|10|2|And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|3|But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
2 Samuel|10|4|So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
2 Samuel|10|5|
2 Samuel|10|6|And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.
2 Samuel|10|7|And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
2 Samuel|10|8|
2 Samuel|10|9|Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
2 Samuel|10|10|And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|10|11|And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
2 Samuel|10|12|Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
2 Samuel|10|13|So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
2 Samuel|10|14|
2 Samuel|10|15|And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2 Samuel|10|16|And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
2 Samuel|10|17|And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
2 Samuel|10|18|seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.
2 Samuel|10|19|
2 Samuel|11|1|
2 Samuel|11|2|And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
2 Samuel|11|3|And David send and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
2 Samuel|11|4|And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned unto her house.
2 Samuel|11|5|
2 Samuel|11|6|, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2 Samuel|11|7|And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
2 Samuel|11|8|from the king.
2 Samuel|11|9|But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
2 Samuel|11|10|And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?
2 Samuel|11|11|And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
2 Samuel|11|12|And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.
2 Samuel|11|13|
2 Samuel|11|14|And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel|11|15|And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
2 Samuel|11|16|And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were.
2 Samuel|11|17|And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2 Samuel|11|18|Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel|11|19|and he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king,
2 Samuel|11|20|it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
2 Samuel|11|21|
2 Samuel|11|22|So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
2 Samuel|11|23|And the messenger said unto David, The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate.
2 Samuel|11|24|And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
2 Samuel|11|25|
2 Samuel|11|26|And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.
2 Samuel|11|27|
2 Samuel|12|1|And Jehovah sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
2 Samuel|12|2|The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds;
2 Samuel|12|3|but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
2 Samuel|12|4|And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
2 Samuel|12|5|And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this is worthy to die:
2 Samuel|12|6|and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
2 Samuel|12|7|And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
2 Samuel|12|8|and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have added unto thee such and such things.
2 Samuel|12|9|Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah, to do that which is evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel|12|10|Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
2 Samuel|12|11|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
2 Samuel|12|12|For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
2 Samuel|12|13|And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said unto David, Jehovah also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
2 Samuel|12|14|Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
2 Samuel|12|15|And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
2 Samuel|12|16|David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
2 Samuel|12|17|beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
2 Samuel|12|18|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead!
2 Samuel|12|19|But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
2 Samuel|12|20|Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of Jehovah, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
2 Samuel|12|21|Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
2 Samuel|12|22|And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knoweth whether Jehovah will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?
2 Samuel|12|23|
2 Samuel|12|24|And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Jehovah loved him;
2 Samuel|12|25|
2 Samuel|12|26|Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
2 Samuel|12|27|And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yea, I have taken the city of waters.
2 Samuel|12|28|Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2 Samuel|12|29|And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
2 Samuel|12|30|precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
2 Samuel|12|31|
2 Samuel|13|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2 Samuel|13|2|And Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything unto her.
2 Samuel|13|3|But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
2 Samuel|13|4|And he said unto him, Why, O son of the king, art thou thus lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
2 Samuel|13|5|And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
2 Samuel|13|6|
2 Samuel|13|7|Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.
2 Samuel|13|8|So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
2 Samuel|13|9|And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
2 Samuel|13|10|And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
2 Samuel|13|11|And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
2 Samuel|13|12|And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
2 Samuel|13|13|And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
2 Samuel|13|14|
2 Samuel|13|15|Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
2 Samuel|13|16|than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
2 Samuel|13|17|Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|18|And she had a garment of divers colors upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
2 Samuel|13|19|
2 Samuel|13|20|And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
2 Samuel|13|21|But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
2 Samuel|13|22|
2 Samuel|13|23|And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
2 Samuel|13|24|And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
2 Samuel|13|25|And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
2 Samuel|13|26|Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
2 Samuel|13|27|But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2 Samuel|13|28|And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
2 Samuel|13|29|
2 Samuel|13|30|And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.
2 Samuel|13|31|Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
2 Samuel|13|32|And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel|13|33|
2 Samuel|13|34|But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.
2 Samuel|13|35|And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is.
2 Samuel|13|36|
2 Samuel|13|37|mourned for his son every day.
2 Samuel|13|38|So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
2 Samuel|13|39|
2 Samuel|14|1|Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel|14|2|And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead:
2 Samuel|14|3|
2 Samuel|14|4|And when the woman of Tekoa spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
2 Samuel|14|5|And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, Of a truth I am a widow, and my husband is dead.
2 Samuel|14|6|And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him.
2 Samuel|14|7|
2 Samuel|14|8|And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
2 Samuel|14|9|And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
2 Samuel|14|10|And the king said, Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
2 Samuel|14|11|
2 Samuel|14|12|Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
2 Samuel|14|13|And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one.
2 Samuel|14|14|For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God take away life, but deviseth means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him.
2 Samuel|14|15|Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|16|For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
2 Samuel|14|17|
2 Samuel|14|18|Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
2 Samuel|14|19|And the king said, Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;
2 Samuel|14|20|
2 Samuel|14|21|And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.
2 Samuel|14|22|And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favor in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of his servant.
2 Samuel|14|23|So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|14|24|
2 Samuel|14|25|Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel|14|26|And when he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight.
2 Samuel|14|27|
2 Samuel|14|28|And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the king’s face.
2 Samuel|14|29|Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
2 Samuel|14|30|Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2 Samuel|14|31|Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
2 Samuel|14|32|And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.
2 Samuel|14|33|
2 Samuel|15|1|And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2 Samuel|15|2|And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that, when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
2 Samuel|15|3|And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.
2 Samuel|15|4|Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
2 Samuel|15|5|And it was so, that, when any man came nigh to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
2 Samuel|15|6|
2 Samuel|15|7|And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto Jehovah, in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|8|For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Jehovah.
2 Samuel|15|9|And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|10|But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron.
2 Samuel|15|11|And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not anything.
2 Samuel|15|12|
2 Samuel|15|13|And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
2 Samuel|15|14|And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
2 Samuel|15|15|And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.
2 Samuel|15|16|And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house.
2 Samuel|15|17|And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth-merhak.
2 Samuel|15|18|
2 Samuel|15|19|to thine own place.
2 Samuel|15|20|Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth be with thee.
2 Samuel|15|21|And Ittai answered the king, and said, As Jehovah liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.
2 Samuel|15|22|And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
2 Samuel|15|23|
2 Samuel|15|24|, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
2 Samuel|15|25|And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
2 Samuel|15|26|but if he say thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
2 Samuel|15|27|a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
2 Samuel|15|28|See, I will tarry at the fords of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.
2 Samuel|15|29|
2 Samuel|15|30|Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2 Samuel|15|31|And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
2 Samuel|15|32|, where God was worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head.
2 Samuel|15|33|And David said unto him, If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto me:
2 Samuel|15|34|but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
2 Samuel|15|35|And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
2 Samuel|15|36|Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye shall hear.
2 Samuel|15|37|
2 Samuel|16|1|, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
2 Samuel|16|2|And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
2 Samuel|16|3|And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said, To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
2 Samuel|16|4|
2 Samuel|16|5|And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.
2 Samuel|16|6|And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2 Samuel|16|7|And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow:
2 Samuel|16|8|
2 Samuel|16|9|Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
2 Samuel|16|10|And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Because he curseth, and because Jehovah hath said unto him, Curse David; who then shall say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
2 Samuel|16|11|? let him alone, and let him curse; for Jehovah hath bidden him.
2 Samuel|16|12|cursing of me this day.
2 Samuel|16|13|So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
2 Samuel|16|14|
2 Samuel|16|15|And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
2 Samuel|16|16|live the king.
2 Samuel|16|17|And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
2 Samuel|16|18|And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom Jehovah, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
2 Samuel|16|19|
2 Samuel|16|20|Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.
2 Samuel|16|21|And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
2 Samuel|16|22|So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel|16|23|
2 Samuel|17|1|Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:
2 Samuel|17|2|and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only;
2 Samuel|17|3|all the people shall be in peace.
2 Samuel|17|4|
2 Samuel|17|5|Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
2 Samuel|17|6|his saying? if not, speak thou.
2 Samuel|17|7|And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.
2 Samuel|17|8|Hushai said moreover, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
2 Samuel|17|9|place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
2 Samuel|17|10|And even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men.
2 Samuel|17|11|But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
2 Samuel|17|12|So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one.
2 Samuel|17|13|Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.
2 Samuel|17|14|
2 Samuel|17|15|Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
2 Samuel|17|16|Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
2 Samuel|17|17|Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.
2 Samuel|17|18|But a lad saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither.
2 Samuel|17|19|And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
2 Samuel|17|20|
2 Samuel|17|21|And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
2 Samuel|17|22|Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|17|23|
2 Samuel|17|24|Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
2 Samuel|17|25|And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
2 Samuel|17|26|
2 Samuel|17|27|And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
2 Samuel|17|28|,
2 Samuel|17|29|
2 Samuel|18|1|And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
2 Samuel|18|2|And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
2 Samuel|18|3|But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succor us out of the city.
2 Samuel|18|4|And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
2 Samuel|18|5|
2 Samuel|18|6|So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel|18|7|And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men.
2 Samuel|18|8|
2 Samuel|18|9|And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between heaven and earth; and the mule that was under him went on.
2 Samuel|18|10|And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
2 Samuel|18|11|silver, and a girdle.
2 Samuel|18|12|silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
2 Samuel|18|13|.
2 Samuel|18|14|Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
2 Samuel|18|15|
2 Samuel|18|16|And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
2 Samuel|18|17|And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
2 Samuel|18|18|
2 Samuel|18|19|Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that Jehovah hath avenged him of his enemies.
2 Samuel|18|20|And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
2 Samuel|18|21|Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
2 Samuel|18|22|Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?
2 Samuel|18|23|
2 Samuel|18|24|Now David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone.
2 Samuel|18|25|And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
2 Samuel|18|26|man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
2 Samuel|18|27|
2 Samuel|18|28|And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
2 Samuel|18|29|And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
2 Samuel|18|30|
2 Samuel|18|31|And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Tidings for my lord the king; for Jehovah hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
2 Samuel|18|32|And the king said unto the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
2 Samuel|18|33|
2 Samuel|19|1|And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
2 Samuel|19|2|And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king grieveth for his son.
2 Samuel|19|3|And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
2 Samuel|19|4|And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2 Samuel|19|5|And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
2 Samuel|19|6|in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
2 Samuel|19|7|Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
2 Samuel|19|8|Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2 Samuel|19|9|And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom.
2 Samuel|19|10|
2 Samuel|19|11|to his house.
2 Samuel|19|12|Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
2 Samuel|19|13|And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
2 Samuel|19|14|, Return thou, and all thy servants.
2 Samuel|19|15|
2 Samuel|19|16|And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
2 Samuel|19|17|And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.
2 Samuel|19|18|And there went over a ferry-boat to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|19|And he said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
2 Samuel|19|20|
2 Samuel|19|21|But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah’s anointed?
2 Samuel|19|22|And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
2 Samuel|19|23|
2 Samuel|19|24|And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.
2 Samuel|19|25|And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?
2 Samuel|19|26|And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame.
2 Samuel|19|27|And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
2 Samuel|19|28|For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more unto the king?
2 Samuel|19|29|And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
2 Samuel|19|30|
2 Samuel|19|31|And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
2 Samuel|19|32|Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.
2 Samuel|19|33|And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel|19|34|And Barzillai said unto the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
2 Samuel|19|35|I am this day fourscore years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2 Samuel|19|36|Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2 Samuel|19|37|Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
2 Samuel|19|38|And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
2 Samuel|19|39|
2 Samuel|19|40|So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him: and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|19|41|And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?
2 Samuel|19|42|And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?
2 Samuel|19|43|
2 Samuel|20|1|And there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
2 Samuel|20|2|
2 Samuel|20|3|
2 Samuel|20|4|Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.
2 Samuel|20|5|Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2 Samuel|20|6|And David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.
2 Samuel|20|7|And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|8|When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.
2 Samuel|20|9|And Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with thee, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
2 Samuel|20|10|And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel|20|11|And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him follow Joab.
2 Samuel|20|12|And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
2 Samuel|20|13|
2 Samuel|20|14|And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.
2 Samuel|20|15|And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
2 Samuel|20|16|Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
2 Samuel|20|17|And he came near unto her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
2 Samuel|20|18|.
2 Samuel|20|19|I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|20|20|And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
2 Samuel|20|21|The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
2 Samuel|20|22|
2 Samuel|20|23|Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
2 Samuel|20|24|and Adoram was over the men subject to taskwork; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;
2 Samuel|20|25|and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
2 Samuel|20|26|
2 Samuel|21|1|And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
2 Samuel|21|2|And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);
2 Samuel|21|3|and David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
2 Samuel|21|4|And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
2 Samuel|21|5|we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
2 Samuel|21|6|
2 Samuel|21|7|But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Jehovah’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
2 Samuel|21|8|But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
2 Samuel|21|9|
2 Samuel|21|10|And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
2 Samuel|21|11|
2 Samuel|21|12|And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa;
2 Samuel|21|13|and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
2 Samuel|21|14|
2 Samuel|21|15|And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David waxed faint;
2 Samuel|21|16|, thought to have slain David.
2 Samuel|21|17|
2 Samuel|21|18|And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
2 Samuel|21|19|And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
2 Samuel|21|20|And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
2 Samuel|21|21|And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.
2 Samuel|21|22|
2 Samuel|22|1|And David spake unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

2 Samuel|23|10|
2 Samuel|23|11|And after him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.
2 Samuel|23|12|
2 Samuel|23|13|And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel|23|14|And David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
2 Samuel|23|15|And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
2 Samuel|23|16|And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah.
2 Samuel|23|17|
2 Samuel|23|18|And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.

2 Samuel|23|20|Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.

2 Samuel|24|1|And again the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel|24|2|And the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.
2 Samuel|24|3|And Joab said unto the king, Now Jehovah thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
2 Samuel|24|4|Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
2 Samuel|24|5|And they passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer:
2 Samuel|24|6|then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Sidon,
2 Samuel|24|7|and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba.
2 Samuel|24|8|So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2 Samuel|24|9|
2 Samuel|24|10|And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, O Jehovah, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
2 Samuel|24|11|And when David rose up in the morning, the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
2 Samuel|24|12|Go and speak unto David, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
2 Samuel|24|13|So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
2 Samuel|24|14|And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah; for his mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
2 Samuel|24|15|So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
2 Samuel|24|16|And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|17|
2 Samuel|24|18|And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel|24|19|And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
2 Samuel|24|20|And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
2 Samuel|24|21|And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
2 Samuel|24|22|And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
2 Samuel|24|23|all this, O king, doth Araunah give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, Jehovah thy God accept thee.
2 Samuel|24|24|And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price. Neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah my God which cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
2 Samuel|24|25|
3 John|1|1|The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
3 John|1|2|Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 John|1|3|For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
3 John|1|4|Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
3 John|1|5|Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
3 John|1|6|who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
3 John|1|7|because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3 John|1|8|We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
3 John|1|9|I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
3 John|1|10|out of the church.
3 John|1|11|Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
3 John|1|12|, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.
3 John|1|13|to thee with ink and pen:
3 John|1|14|
Hosea|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
Hosea|1|2|from Jehovah.
Hosea|1|3|So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.
Hosea|1|4|And Jehovah said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
Hosea|1|5|And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
Hosea|1|6|said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.
Hosea|1|7|But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by Jehovah their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
Hosea|1|8|Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
Hosea|1|9|.
Hosea|1|10|the sons of the living God.
Hosea|1|11|
Hosea|2|1|Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
Hosea|2|2|Contend with your mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her whoredoms from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
Hosea|2|3|lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
Hosea|2|4|Yea, upon her children will I have no mercy; for they are children of whoredom;
Hosea|2|5|for their mother hath played the harlot; she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.
Hosea|2|6|Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.
Hosea|2|7|And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
Hosea|2|8|For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
Hosea|2|9|Therefore will I take back my grain in the time thereof, and my new wine in the season thereof, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.
Hosea|2|10|And now will I uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.
Hosea|2|11|I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
Hosea|2|12|And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said, These are my hire that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
Hosea|2|13|And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, unto which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith Jehovah.
Hosea|2|14|Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
Hosea|2|15|And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall make answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
Hosea|2|16|And it shall be at that day, saith Jehovah, that thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.
Hosea|2|17|For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
Hosea|2|18|And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.
Hosea|2|19|And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.
Hosea|2|20|I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know Jehovah.
Hosea|2|21|And it shall come to pass in that day, I will answer, saith Jehovah, I will answer the heavens, and they shall answer the earth;
Hosea|2|22|and the earth shall answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
Hosea|2|23|
Hosea|3|1|friend, and an adulteress, even as Jehovah loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other gods, and love cakes of raisins.
Hosea|3|2|of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley;
Hosea|3|3|and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife: so will I also be toward thee.
Hosea|3|4|For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim:
Hosea|3|5|
Hosea|4|1|Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Hosea|4|2|There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
Hosea|4|3|Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
Hosea|4|4|Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
Hosea|4|5|And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
Hosea|4|6|My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
Hosea|4|7|As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
Hosea|4|8|They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
Hosea|4|9|And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.
Hosea|4|10|And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.
Hosea|4|11|Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
Hosea|4|12|from under their God.
Hosea|4|13|They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.
Hosea|4|14|themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.
Hosea|4|15|Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.
Hosea|4|16|For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.
Hosea|4|17|Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
Hosea|4|18|Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.
Hosea|4|19|
Hosea|5|1|Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
Hosea|5|2|And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.
Hosea|5|3|I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled.
Hosea|5|4|Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah.
Hosea|5|5|And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.
Hosea|5|6|They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them.
Hosea|5|7|They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields.
Hosea|5|8|Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin.
Hosea|5|9|Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.
Hosea|5|10|The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
Hosea|5|11|command.
Hosea|5|12|Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
Hosea|5|13|his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.
Hosea|5|14|For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.
Hosea|5|15|
Hosea|6|1|Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
Hosea|6|2|After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
Hosea|6|3|And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.
Hosea|6|4|O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.
Hosea|6|5|the light that goeth forth.
Hosea|6|6|For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
Hosea|6|7|But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
Hosea|6|8|Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
Hosea|6|9|And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.
Hosea|6|10|in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
Hosea|6|11|
Hosea|7|1|When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without.
Hosea|7|2|And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.
Hosea|7|3|They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
Hosea|7|4|, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened.
Hosea|7|5|On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers.
Hosea|7|6|For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
Hosea|7|7|They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.
Hosea|7|8|Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Hosea|7|9|not.
Hosea|7|10|And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this.
Hosea|7|11|And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.
Hosea|7|12|When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
Hosea|7|13|Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
Hosea|7|14|And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me.
Hosea|7|15|Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me.
Hosea|7|16|
Hosea|8|1|against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
Hosea|8|2|They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.
Hosea|8|3|Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
Hosea|8|4|They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
Hosea|8|5|He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
Hosea|8|6|For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God; yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
Hosea|8|7|For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing grain; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.
Hosea|8|8|Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth.
Hosea|8|9|a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
Hosea|8|10|Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.
Hosea|8|11|Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning, altars have been unto him for sinning.
Hosea|8|12|I wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law; but they are counted as a strange thing.
Hosea|8|13|As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but Jehovah accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.
Hosea|8|14|
Hosea|9|1|from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor.
Hosea|9|2|The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.
Hosea|9|3|They shall not dwell in Jehovah’s land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.
Hosea|9|4|They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
Hosea|9|5|What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?
Hosea|9|6|Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents.
Hosea|9|7|The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.
Hosea|9|8|enmity in the house of his God.
Hosea|9|9|They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.
Hosea|9|10|I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.
Hosea|9|11|As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.
Hosea|9|12|Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
Hosea|9|13|Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.
Hosea|9|14|Give them, O Jehovah-what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
Hosea|9|15|All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.
Hosea|9|16|Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.
Hosea|9|17|
Hosea|10|1|Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.
Hosea|10|2|Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.
Hosea|10|3|Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us?
Hosea|10|4|words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
Hosea|10|5|The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
Hosea|10|6|It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
Hosea|10|7|Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.
Hosea|10|8|The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
Hosea|10|9|O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.
Hosea|10|10|When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.
Hosea|10|11|; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.
Hosea|10|12|Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
Hosea|10|13|Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
Hosea|10|14|Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
Hosea|10|15|
Hosea|11|1|When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
Hosea|11|2|called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
Hosea|11|3|Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
Hosea|11|4|I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.
Hosea|11|5|.
Hosea|11|6|, because of their own counsels.
Hosea|11|7|.
Hosea|11|8|shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.
Hosea|11|9|I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.
Hosea|11|10|They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
Hosea|11|11|They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.
Hosea|11|12|
Hosea|12|1|Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
Hosea|12|2|Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
Hosea|12|3|In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God:
Hosea|12|4|yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us,
Hosea|12|5|.
Hosea|12|6|Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.
Hosea|12|7|a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
Hosea|12|8|And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.
Hosea|12|9|But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.
Hosea|12|10|I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.
Hosea|12|11|Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
Hosea|12|12|.
Hosea|12|13|And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
Hosea|12|14|
Hosea|13|1|When Ephraim spake, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.
Hosea|13|2|And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
Hosea|13|3|Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the dew that passeth early away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.
Hosea|13|4|Yet I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt know no god but me, and besides me there is no saviour.
Hosea|13|5|I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
Hosea|13|6|According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.
Hosea|13|7|Therefore am I unto them as a lion; as a leopard will I watch by the way;
Hosea|13|8|I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the caul of their heart; and there will I devour them like a lioness; the wild beast shall tear them.
Hosea|13|9|against me, against thy help.
Hosea|13|10|Where now is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?
Hosea|13|11|I have given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.
Hosea|13|12|The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store.
Hosea|13|13|The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son; for it is time he should not tarry in the place of the breaking forth of children.
Hosea|13|14|I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O Sheol, where is thy destruction? repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
Hosea|13|15|Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, the breath of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall make spoil of the treasure of all goodly vessels.
Hosea|13|16|
Hosea|14|1|O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
Hosea|14|2|our lips.
Hosea|14|3|our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
Hosea|14|4|I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.
Hosea|14|5|I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
Hosea|14|6|His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
Hosea|14|7|the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
Hosea|14|8|, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.
Hosea|14|9|
Jeremiah|1|1|The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
Jeremiah|1|2|to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
Jeremiah|1|3|It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
Jeremiah|1|4|Now the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|1|5|Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; I have appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.
Jeremiah|1|6|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, I know not how to speak; for I am a child.
Jeremiah|1|7|But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for to whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go, and whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.
Jeremiah|1|8|Be not afraid because of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|1|9|Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth:
Jeremiah|1|10|see, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
Jeremiah|1|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.
Jeremiah|1|12|Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.
Jeremiah|1|13|And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face thereof is from the north.
Jeremiah|1|14|Then Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
Jeremiah|1|15|For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah|1|16|And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
Jeremiah|1|17|Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.
Jeremiah|1|18|For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
Jeremiah|1|19|
Jeremiah|2|1|And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Jeremiah|2|2|Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals; how thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
Jeremiah|2|3|holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|4|Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
Jeremiah|2|5|thus saith Jehovah, What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
Jeremiah|2|6|Neither said they, Where is Jehovah that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt?
Jeremiah|2|7|And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
Jeremiah|2|8|The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law knew me not: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
Jeremiah|2|9|Wherefore I will yet contend with you, saith Jehovah, and with your children’s children will I contend.
Jeremiah|2|10|For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there hath been such a thing.
Jeremiah|2|11|gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.
Jeremiah|2|12|Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|13|For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
Jeremiah|2|14|? why is he become a prey?
Jeremiah|2|15|The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|2|16|The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.
Jeremiah|2|17|Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, when he led thee by the way?
Jeremiah|2|18|And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what hast thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
Jeremiah|2|19|Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|2|20|For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds; and thou saidst, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou didst bow thyself, playing the harlot.
Jeremiah|2|21|Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me?
Jeremiah|2|22|For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|23|a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
Jeremiah|2|24|a wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
Jeremiah|2|25|Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
Jeremiah|2|26|As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;
Jeremiah|2|27|who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
Jeremiah|2|28|But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
Jeremiah|2|29|Wherefore will ye contend with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|2|30|In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
Jeremiah|2|31|O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? or a land of thick darkness? wherefore say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more unto thee?
Jeremiah|2|32|Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
Jeremiah|2|33|How trimmest thou thy way to seek love! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways.
Jeremiah|2|34|Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: thou didst not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.
Jeremiah|2|35|Yet thou saidst, I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
Jeremiah|2|36|Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
Jeremiah|2|37|
Jeremiah|3|1|They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|2|Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
Jeremiah|3|3|Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hast a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
Jeremiah|3|4|Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?
Jeremiah|3|5|for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.
Jeremiah|3|6|Moreover Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
Jeremiah|3|7|And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
Jeremiah|3|8|And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.
Jeremiah|3|9|And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
Jeremiah|3|10|And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|11|And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
Jeremiah|3|12|for ever.
Jeremiah|3|13|Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|14|Return, O backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
Jeremiah|3|15|and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
Jeremiah|3|16|And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith Jehovah, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.
Jeremiah|3|17|At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
Jeremiah|3|18|In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers.
Jeremiah|3|19|But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.
Jeremiah|3|20|Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|3|21|the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.
Jeremiah|3|22|Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|3|23|from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
Jeremiah|3|24|But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
Jeremiah|3|25|
Jeremiah|4|1|If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, if thou wilt return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight; then shalt thou not be removed;
Jeremiah|4|2|and thou shalt swear, As Jehovah liveth, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
Jeremiah|4|3|For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
Jeremiah|4|4|Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah|4|5|Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
Jeremiah|4|6|Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, stay not; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
Jeremiah|4|7|A lion is gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|4|8|For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.
Jeremiah|4|9|And it shall come to pass at that day, saith Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
Jeremiah|4|10|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the life.
Jeremiah|4|11|At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
Jeremiah|4|12|a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.
Jeremiah|4|13|as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are ruined.
Jeremiah|4|14|O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?
Jeremiah|4|15|For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth evil from the hills of Ephraim:
Jeremiah|4|16|watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
Jeremiah|4|17|As keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|4|18|Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reacheth unto thy heart.
Jeremiah|4|19|My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
Jeremiah|4|20|my curtains in a moment.
Jeremiah|4|21|How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
Jeremiah|4|22|For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
Jeremiah|4|23|I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
Jeremiah|4|24|I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.
Jeremiah|4|25|I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
Jeremiah|4|26|before his fierce anger.
Jeremiah|4|27|For thus saith Jehovah, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.
Jeremiah|4|28|For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
Jeremiah|4|29|Every city fleeth for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwelleth therein.
Jeremiah|4|30|lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.
Jeremiah|4|31|
Jeremiah|5|1|Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth justly, that seeketh truth; and I will pardon her.
Jeremiah|5|2|And though they say, As Jehovah liveth; surely they swear falsely.
Jeremiah|5|3|O Jehovah, do not thine eyes look upon truth? thou hast stricken them, but they were not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
Jeremiah|5|4|Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, nor the law of their God:
Jeremiah|5|5|I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they know the way of Jehovah, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
Jeremiah|5|6|their backslidings are increased.
Jeremiah|5|7|How can I pardon thee? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the harlots’ houses.
Jeremiah|5|8|They were as fed horses roaming at large; every one neighed after his neighbor’s wife.
Jeremiah|5|9|Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|5|10|Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Jehovah’s.
Jeremiah|5|11|For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|5|12|They have denied Jehovah, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
Jeremiah|5|13|and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
Jeremiah|5|14|Wherefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
Jeremiah|5|15|Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.
Jeremiah|5|16|Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
Jeremiah|5|17|thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees; they shall beat down thy fortified cities, wherein thou trustest, with the sword.
Jeremiah|5|18|But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make a full end with you.
Jeremiah|5|19|And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt thou say unto them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
Jeremiah|5|20|Declare ye this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|5|21|Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and see not; that have ears, and hear not:
Jeremiah|5|22|Fear ye not me? saith Jehovah: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it? and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.
Jeremiah|5|23|But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
Jeremiah|5|24|Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
Jeremiah|5|25|Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withholden good from you.
Jeremiah|5|26|For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.
Jeremiah|5|27|As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxed rich.
Jeremiah|5|28|They are waxed fat, they shine: yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they plead not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.
Jeremiah|5|29|Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|5|30|A wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land:
Jeremiah|5|31|
Jeremiah|6|1|Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.
Jeremiah|6|2|The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.
Jeremiah|6|3|Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.
Jeremiah|6|4|Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
Jeremiah|6|5|Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
Jeremiah|6|6|For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.
Jeremiah|6|7|As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.
Jeremiah|6|8|Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.
Jeremiah|6|9|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.
Jeremiah|6|10|To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
Jeremiah|6|11|Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
Jeremiah|6|12|And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|6|13|For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
Jeremiah|6|14|They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Jeremiah|6|15|Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|6|16|.
Jeremiah|6|17|, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.
Jeremiah|6|18|Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.
Jeremiah|6|19|Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
Jeremiah|6|20|To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.
Jeremiah|6|21|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
Jeremiah|6|22|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Jeremiah|6|23|They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.
Jeremiah|6|24|pangs as of a woman in travail.
Jeremiah|6|25|terror, are on every side.
Jeremiah|6|26|O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
Jeremiah|6|27|a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.
Jeremiah|6|28|They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.
Jeremiah|6|29|The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.
Jeremiah|6|30|
Jeremiah|7|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|7|2|Stand in the gate of Jehovah’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.
Jeremiah|7|3|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
Jeremiah|7|4|Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, are these.
Jeremiah|7|5|For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
Jeremiah|7|6|if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:
Jeremiah|7|7|then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore.
Jeremiah|7|8|Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
Jeremiah|7|9|Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods that ye have not known,
Jeremiah|7|10|and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations?
Jeremiah|7|11|Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|7|12|But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
Jeremiah|7|13|And now, because ye have done all these works, saith Jehovah, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not:
Jeremiah|7|14|therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
Jeremiah|7|15|And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
Jeremiah|7|16|Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.
Jeremiah|7|17|Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah|7|18|The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah|7|19|themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
Jeremiah|7|20|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
Jeremiah|7|21|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.
Jeremiah|7|22|For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices:
Jeremiah|7|23|but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
Jeremiah|7|24|in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
Jeremiah|7|25|Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
Jeremiah|7|26|yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.
Jeremiah|7|27|And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
Jeremiah|7|28|And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
Jeremiah|7|29|, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
Jeremiah|7|30|For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith Jehovah: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah|7|31|And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.
Jeremiah|7|32|.
Jeremiah|7|33|And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
Jeremiah|7|34|
Jeremiah|8|1|At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
Jeremiah|8|2|and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
Jeremiah|8|3|And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|8|4|Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Shall men fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?
Jeremiah|8|5|Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
Jeremiah|8|6|I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turneth to his course, as a horse that rusheth headlong in the battle.
Jeremiah|8|7|Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the law of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|8|How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.
Jeremiah|8|9|The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them?
Jeremiah|8|10|Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall possess them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
Jeremiah|8|11|And they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Jeremiah|8|12|Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|13|I have given them shall pass away from them.
Jeremiah|8|14|Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|15|for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
Jeremiah|8|16|The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembleth; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those that dwell therein.
Jeremiah|8|17|For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|8|18|Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.
Jeremiah|8|19|Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: is not Jehovah in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with foreign vanities?
Jeremiah|8|20|The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
Jeremiah|8|21|For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay hath taken hold on me.
Jeremiah|8|22|
Jeremiah|9|1|Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
Jeremiah|9|2|Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
Jeremiah|9|3|their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|4|Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
Jeremiah|9|5|And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
Jeremiah|9|6|Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|7|should I do, because of the daughter of my people?
Jeremiah|9|8|Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him.
Jeremiah|9|9|Shall I not visit them for these things? saith Jehovah; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Jeremiah|9|10|For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passeth through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the heavens and the beasts are fled, they are gone.
Jeremiah|9|11|And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|9|12|he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it? wherefore is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?
Jeremiah|9|13|And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,
Jeremiah|9|14|but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them;
Jeremiah|9|15|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
Jeremiah|9|16|I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them.
Jeremiah|9|17|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skilful women, that they may come:
Jeremiah|9|18|and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
Jeremiah|9|19|For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.
Jeremiah|9|20|Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation.
Jeremiah|9|21|the young men from the streets.
Jeremiah|9|22|.
Jeremiah|9|23|Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches;
Jeremiah|9|24|but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he hath understanding, and knoweth me, that I am Jehovah who exerciseth lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|9|25|uncircumcision:
Jeremiah|9|26|
Jeremiah|10|1|Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
Jeremiah|10|2|thus saith Jehovah, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.
Jeremiah|10|3|For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
Jeremiah|10|4|They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
Jeremiah|10|5|They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.
Jeremiah|10|6|There is none like unto thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
Jeremiah|10|7|Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.
Jeremiah|10|8|But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.
Jeremiah|10|9|There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.
Jeremiah|10|10|But Jehovah is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
Jeremiah|10|11|Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
Jeremiah|10|12|He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens:
Jeremiah|10|13|when he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
Jeremiah|10|14|without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
Jeremiah|10|15|They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
Jeremiah|10|16|The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.
Jeremiah|10|17|Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.
Jeremiah|10|18|.
Jeremiah|10|19|grief, and I must bear it.
Jeremiah|10|20|My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
Jeremiah|10|21|For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Jehovah: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
Jeremiah|10|22|The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.
Jeremiah|10|23|O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
Jeremiah|10|24|O Jehovah, correct me, but in measure: not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
Jeremiah|10|25|
Jeremiah|11|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|11|2|Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|11|3|and say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant,
Jeremiah|11|4|which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God;
Jeremiah|11|5|that I may establish the oath which I sware unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, O Jehovah.
Jeremiah|11|6|And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
Jeremiah|11|7|For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
Jeremiah|11|8|Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
Jeremiah|11|9|And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|11|10|They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
Jeremiah|11|11|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry unto me, but I will not hearken unto them.
Jeremiah|11|12|Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
Jeremiah|11|13|For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
Jeremiah|11|14|Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me because of their trouble.
Jeremiah|11|15|many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
Jeremiah|11|16|Jehovah called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.
Jeremiah|11|17|For Jehovah of hosts, who planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense unto Baal.
Jeremiah|11|18|And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then thou showedst me their doings.
Jeremiah|11|19|, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
Jeremiah|11|20|But, O Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, I shall see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Jeremiah|11|21|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand;
Jeremiah|11|22|therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
Jeremiah|11|23|
Jeremiah|12|1|Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, when I contend with thee; yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?
Jeremiah|12|2|Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
Jeremiah|12|3|But thou, O Jehovah, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest my heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
Jeremiah|12|4|How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
Jeremiah|12|5|If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of the Jordan?
Jeremiah|12|6|For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
Jeremiah|12|7|I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
Jeremiah|12|8|My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.
Jeremiah|12|9|Is my heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
Jeremiah|12|10|Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
Jeremiah|12|11|They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
Jeremiah|12|12|Destroyers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.
Jeremiah|12|13|They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|12|14|Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
Jeremiah|12|15|And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
Jeremiah|12|16|And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Jehovah liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.
Jeremiah|12|17|
Jeremiah|13|1|Thus saith Jehovah unto me, Go, and buy thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
Jeremiah|13|2|So I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and put it upon my loins.
Jeremiah|13|3|And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying,
Jeremiah|13|4|Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
Jeremiah|13|5|So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
Jeremiah|13|6|And it came to pass after many days, that Jehovah said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
Jeremiah|13|7|Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|8|Then the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|13|9|Thus saith Jehovah, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|13|10|This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.
Jeremiah|13|11|For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
Jeremiah|13|12|Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
Jeremiah|13|13|Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
Jeremiah|13|14|And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
Jeremiah|13|15|Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for Jehovah hath spoken.
Jeremiah|13|16|Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
Jeremiah|13|17|pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.
Jeremiah|13|18|Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.
Jeremiah|13|19|The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.
Jeremiah|13|20|Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?
Jeremiah|13|21|What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail?
Jeremiah|13|22|And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.
Jeremiah|13|23|Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
Jeremiah|13|24|Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.
Jeremiah|13|25|This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
Jeremiah|13|26|Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.
Jeremiah|13|27|
Jeremiah|14|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.
Jeremiah|14|2|Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
Jeremiah|14|3|And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are put to shame and confounded, and cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|4|Because of the ground which is cracked, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are put to shame, they cover their heads.
Jeremiah|14|5|, because there is no grass.
Jeremiah|14|6|And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
Jeremiah|14|7|Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O Jehovah; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|8|O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
Jeremiah|14|9|Why shouldest thou be as a man affrighted, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.
Jeremiah|14|10|Thus saith Jehovah unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Jehovah doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
Jeremiah|14|11|good.
Jeremiah|14|12|When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Jeremiah|14|13|Then said I, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
Jeremiah|14|14|Then Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.
Jeremiah|14|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
Jeremiah|14|16|And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them-them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
Jeremiah|14|17|And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
Jeremiah|14|18|If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, they that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
Jeremiah|14|19|Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!
Jeremiah|14|20|We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.
Jeremiah|14|21|, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
Jeremiah|14|22|
Jeremiah|15|1|Then said Jehovah unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
Jeremiah|15|2|And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
Jeremiah|15|3|And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
Jeremiah|15|4|And I will cause them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|15|5|For who will have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who will bemoan thee? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare?
Jeremiah|15|6|Thou hast rejected me, saith Jehovah, thou art gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against thee, and destroyed thee; I am weary with repenting.
Jeremiah|15|7|of children, I have destroyed my people; they returned not from their ways.
Jeremiah|15|8|Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
Jeremiah|15|9|She that hath borne seven languisheth; she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath been put to shame and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|10|every one of them doth curse me.
Jeremiah|15|11|Jehovah said, Verily I will strengthen thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
Jeremiah|15|12|Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
Jeremiah|15|13|Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
Jeremiah|15|14|to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
Jeremiah|15|15|O Jehovah, thou knowest; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
Jeremiah|15|16|Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts.
Jeremiah|15|17|I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.
Jeremiah|15|18|, as waters that fail?
Jeremiah|15|19|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, that thou mayest stand before me; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.
Jeremiah|15|20|And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|15|21|
Jeremiah|16|1|The word of Jehovah came also unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|16|2|Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters, in this place.
Jeremiah|16|3|For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:
Jeremiah|16|4|They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|16|5|For thus saith Jehovah, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even lovingkindness and tender mercies.
Jeremiah|16|6|Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
Jeremiah|16|7|for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
Jeremiah|16|8|And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
Jeremiah|16|9|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
Jeremiah|16|10|And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Jehovah our God?
Jeremiah|16|11|Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
Jeremiah|16|12|and ye have done evil more than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto me:
Jeremiah|16|13|therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.
Jeremiah|16|14|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah|16|15|but, As Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.
Jeremiah|16|16|Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
Jeremiah|16|17|For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes.
Jeremiah|16|18|And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled mine inheritance with their abominations.
Jeremiah|16|19|vanity and things wherein there is no profit.
Jeremiah|16|20|Shall a man make unto himself gods, which yet are no gods?
Jeremiah|16|21|
Jeremiah|17|1|with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;
Jeremiah|17|2|whilst their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees upon the high hills.
Jeremiah|17|3|thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.
Jeremiah|17|4|And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever.
Jeremiah|17|5|Thus saith Jehovah: Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from Jehovah.
Jeremiah|17|6|For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
Jeremiah|17|7|Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, and whose trust Jehovah is.
Jeremiah|17|8|For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat cometh, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
Jeremiah|17|9|The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?
Jeremiah|17|10|I, Jehovah, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
Jeremiah|17|11|which she hath not laid, so is he that getteth riches, and not by right; in the midst of his days they shall leave him, and at his end he shall be a fool.
Jeremiah|17|12|on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
Jeremiah|17|13|O Jehovah, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be put to shame. They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters.
Jeremiah|17|14|Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.
Jeremiah|17|15|Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now.
Jeremiah|17|16|As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was before thy face.
Jeremiah|17|17|Be not a terror unto me: thou art my refuge in the day of evil.
Jeremiah|17|18|Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but let not me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed; bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
Jeremiah|17|19|Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|17|20|and say unto them, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:
Jeremiah|17|21|Thus saith Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|17|22|neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work: but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
Jeremiah|17|23|But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.
Jeremiah|17|24|And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;
Jeremiah|17|25|then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain for ever.
Jeremiah|17|26|thanksgiving, unto the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|17|27|
Jeremiah|18|1|The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|18|2|Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
Jeremiah|18|3|Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he was making a work on the wheels.
Jeremiah|18|4|And when the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
Jeremiah|18|5|Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Jeremiah|18|6|O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
Jeremiah|18|7|At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;
Jeremiah|18|8|if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
Jeremiah|18|9|And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
Jeremiah|18|10|if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
Jeremiah|18|11|Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
Jeremiah|18|12|But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.
Jeremiah|18|13|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such things; the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.
Jeremiah|18|14|shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
Jeremiah|18|15|; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;
Jeremiah|18|16|to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shake his head.
Jeremiah|18|17|I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
Jeremiah|18|18|Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.
Jeremiah|18|19|Give heed to me, O Jehovah, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
Jeremiah|18|20|Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.
Jeremiah|18|21|their young men smitten of the sword in battle.
Jeremiah|18|22|Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
Jeremiah|18|23|
Jeremiah|19|1|of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
Jeremiah|19|2|and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee;
Jeremiah|19|3|and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
Jeremiah|19|4|Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, that they knew not, they and their fathers and the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
Jeremiah|19|5|and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:
Jeremiah|19|6|therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.
Jeremiah|19|7|And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|19|8|And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.
Jeremiah|19|9|And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the distress, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall distress them.
Jeremiah|19|10|Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
Jeremiah|19|11|and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.
Jeremiah|19|12|Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth:
Jeremiah|19|13|and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods.
Jeremiah|19|14|Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah’s house, and said to all the people:
Jeremiah|19|15|
Jeremiah|20|1|Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Jehovah, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
Jeremiah|20|2|Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|20|3|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
Jeremiah|20|4|For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
Jeremiah|20|5|Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|20|6|And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.
Jeremiah|20|7|O Jehovah, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.
Jeremiah|20|8|For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.
Jeremiah|20|9|.
Jeremiah|20|10|all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
Jeremiah|20|11|a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.
Jeremiah|20|12|But, O Jehovah of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
Jeremiah|20|13|Sing unto Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
Jeremiah|20|14|Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
Jeremiah|20|15|Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
Jeremiah|20|16|And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;
Jeremiah|20|17|because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
Jeremiah|20|18|
Jeremiah|21|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,
Jeremiah|21|2|Inquire, I pray thee, of Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us: peradventure Jehovah will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.
Jeremiah|21|3|Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
Jeremiah|21|4|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans that besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
Jeremiah|21|5|And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.
Jeremiah|21|6|And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
Jeremiah|21|7|And afterward, saith Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
Jeremiah|21|8|And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
Jeremiah|21|9|He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and passeth over to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
Jeremiah|21|10|For I have set my face upon this city for evil, and not for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
Jeremiah|21|11|And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Jeremiah|21|12|O house of David, thus saith Jehovah, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Jeremiah|21|13|of the rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
Jeremiah|21|14|
Jeremiah|22|1|Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
Jeremiah|22|2|And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates.
Jeremiah|22|3|Thus saith Jehovah: Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the sojourner, the fatherless, nor the widow; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
Jeremiah|22|4|For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
Jeremiah|22|5|But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.
Jeremiah|22|6|cities which are not inhabited.
Jeremiah|22|7|And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
Jeremiah|22|8|And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city?
Jeremiah|22|9|Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
Jeremiah|22|10|Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
Jeremiah|22|11|who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more.
Jeremiah|22|12|But in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.
Jeremiah|22|13|Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by injustice; that useth his neighbor’s service without wages, and giveth him not his hire;
Jeremiah|22|14|that saith, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
Jeremiah|22|15|Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.
Jeremiah|22|16|He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|17|But thine eyes and thy heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
Jeremiah|22|18|Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!
Jeremiah|22|19|He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|22|20|Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all thy lovers are destroyed.
Jeremiah|22|21|I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.
Jeremiah|22|22|The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.
Jeremiah|22|23|O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
Jeremiah|22|24|As I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;
Jeremiah|22|25|and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|22|26|And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.
Jeremiah|22|27|But to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return, thither shall they not return.
Jeremiah|22|28|Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein none delighteth? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they know not?
Jeremiah|22|29|O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|22|30|
Jeremiah|23|1|Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|2|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|3|And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
Jeremiah|23|4|And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|5|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah|23|6|In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
Jeremiah|23|7|Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that they shall no more say, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
Jeremiah|23|8|but, As Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
Jeremiah|23|9|Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of his holy words.
Jeremiah|23|10|For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;
Jeremiah|23|11|for both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|12|Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|13|And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
Jeremiah|23|14|In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
Jeremiah|23|15|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
Jeremiah|23|16|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|17|They say continually unto them that despise me, Jehovah hath said, Ye shall have peace; and unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil shall come upon you.
Jeremiah|23|18|For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, that he should perceive and hear his word? who hath marked my word, and heard it?
Jeremiah|23|19|wrath, is gone forth, yea, a whirling tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|23|20|The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it perfectly.
Jeremiah|23|21|I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I spake not unto them, yet they prophesied.
Jeremiah|23|22|But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah|23|23|Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
Jeremiah|23|24|Can any hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|25|I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
Jeremiah|23|26|How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
Jeremiah|23|27|that think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name for Baal.
Jeremiah|23|28|The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|29|Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
Jeremiah|23|30|Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbor.
Jeremiah|23|31|Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.
Jeremiah|23|32|Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith Jehovah, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|33|And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? then shalt thou say unto them, What burden! I will cast you off, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|23|34|And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that man and his house.
Jeremiah|23|35|Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|36|And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more: for every man’s own word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God.
Jeremiah|23|37|Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath Jehovah answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?
Jeremiah|23|38|But if ye say, The burden of Jehovah; therefore thus saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
Jeremiah|23|39|therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from my presence:
Jeremiah|23|40|
Jeremiah|24|1|Jehovah showed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|24|2|One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
Jeremiah|24|3|Then said Jehovah unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|24|4|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|24|5|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
Jeremiah|24|6|For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
Jeremiah|24|7|And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
Jeremiah|24|8|And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus saith Jehovah, So will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt,
Jeremiah|24|9|I will even give them up to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
Jeremiah|24|10|
Jeremiah|25|1|The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,)
Jeremiah|25|2|which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
Jeremiah|25|3|From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
Jeremiah|25|4|And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear,)
Jeremiah|25|5|saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore;
Jeremiah|25|6|and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
Jeremiah|25|7|Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
Jeremiah|25|8|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words,
Jeremiah|25|9|unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
Jeremiah|25|10|Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
Jeremiah|25|11|And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
Jeremiah|25|12|And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith Jehovah, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.
Jeremiah|25|13|And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
Jeremiah|25|14|For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
Jeremiah|25|15|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
Jeremiah|25|16|And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
Jeremiah|25|17|Then took I the cup at Jehovah’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me:
Jeremiah|25|18|, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
Jeremiah|25|19|Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
Jeremiah|25|20|and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of the Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
Jeremiah|25|21|Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
Jeremiah|25|22|and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;
Jeremiah|25|23|cut off;
Jeremiah|25|24|and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness;
Jeremiah|25|25|and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
Jeremiah|25|26|and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
Jeremiah|25|27|And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
Jeremiah|25|28|And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.
Jeremiah|25|29|For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|25|30|, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
Jeremiah|25|31|A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|25|32|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Jeremiah|25|33|And the slain of Jehovah shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
Jeremiah|25|34|, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.
Jeremiah|25|35|And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
Jeremiah|25|36|A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.
Jeremiah|25|37|And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|25|38|
Jeremiah|26|1|In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|26|2|Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah’s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Jehovah’s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word.
Jeremiah|26|3|It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
Jeremiah|26|4|And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
Jeremiah|26|5|to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even rising up early and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;
Jeremiah|26|6|then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
Jeremiah|26|7|And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|26|8|And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
Jeremiah|26|9|Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered unto Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|26|10|.
Jeremiah|26|11|Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
Jeremiah|26|12|Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
Jeremiah|26|13|Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
Jeremiah|26|14|But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
Jeremiah|26|15|Only know ye for certain that, if ye put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
Jeremiah|26|16|Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|26|17|Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
Jeremiah|26|18|Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
Jeremiah|26|19|Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat the favor of Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
Jeremiah|26|20|And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
Jeremiah|26|21|and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty-men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:
Jeremiah|26|22|, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt;
Jeremiah|26|23|and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king, who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
Jeremiah|26|24|
Jeremiah|27|1|In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|27|2|Thus saith Jehovah to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck;
Jeremiah|27|3|and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
Jeremiah|27|4|and give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters:
Jeremiah|27|5|I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.
Jeremiah|27|6|And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.
Jeremiah|27|7|And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.
Jeremiah|27|8|And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith Jehovah, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
Jeremiah|27|9|But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
Jeremiah|27|10|for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
Jeremiah|27|11|will I let remain in their own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
Jeremiah|27|12|And I spake to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
Jeremiah|27|13|Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Jeremiah|27|14|And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
Jeremiah|27|15|For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
Jeremiah|27|16|Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
Jeremiah|27|17|Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation?
Jeremiah|27|18|But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
Jeremiah|27|19|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
Jeremiah|27|20|which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
Jeremiah|27|21|yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem:
Jeremiah|27|22|
Jeremiah|28|1|And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of Jehovah, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
Jeremiah|28|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|28|3|Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:
Jeremiah|28|4|and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|28|5|Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah,
Jeremiah|28|6|even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: Jehovah do so; Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Jehovah’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.
Jeremiah|28|7|Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:
Jeremiah|28|8|The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
Jeremiah|28|9|The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath truly sent him.
Jeremiah|28|10|Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.
Jeremiah|28|11|And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Jeremiah|28|12|Then the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|28|13|Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.
Jeremiah|28|14|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may served Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
Jeremiah|28|15|Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
Jeremiah|28|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against Jehovah.
Jeremiah|28|17|
Jeremiah|29|1|Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
Jeremiah|29|2|the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem,)
Jeremiah|29|3|by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,) saying,
Jeremiah|29|4|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:
Jeremiah|29|5|Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
Jeremiah|29|6|Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished.
Jeremiah|29|7|And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
Jeremiah|29|8|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
Jeremiah|29|9|For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|10|For thus saith Jehovah, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
Jeremiah|29|11|For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.
Jeremiah|29|12|And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
Jeremiah|29|13|And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
Jeremiah|29|14|And I will be found of you, saith Jehovah, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places wither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will bring you again unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
Jeremiah|29|15|Because ye have said, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
Jeremiah|29|16|thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
Jeremiah|29|17|thus saith Jehovah of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Jeremiah|29|18|And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them;
Jeremiah|29|19|because they have not hearkened to my words, saith Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|20|Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Jeremiah|29|21|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
Jeremiah|29|22|and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
Jeremiah|29|23|because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|29|24|And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,
Jeremiah|29|25|Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jeremiah|29|26|Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.
Jeremiah|29|27|Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,
Jeremiah|29|28|is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
Jeremiah|29|29|And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Jeremiah|29|30|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|29|31|Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;
Jeremiah|29|32|
Jeremiah|30|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|30|2|Thus speaketh Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
Jeremiah|30|3|For, lo, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
Jeremiah|30|4|And these are the words that Jehovah spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
Jeremiah|30|5|For thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
Jeremiah|30|6|Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
Jeremiah|30|7|Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
Jeremiah|30|8|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;
Jeremiah|30|9|but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
Jeremiah|30|10|Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
Jeremiah|30|11|For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.
Jeremiah|30|12|For thus saith Jehovah, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.
Jeremiah|30|13|There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
Jeremiah|30|14|All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
Jeremiah|30|15|Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
Jeremiah|30|16|Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
Jeremiah|30|17|, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
Jeremiah|30|18|Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
Jeremiah|30|19|And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
Jeremiah|30|20|Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.
Jeremiah|30|21|And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|30|22|And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Jeremiah|30|23|wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
Jeremiah|30|24|
Jeremiah|31|1|At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
Jeremiah|31|2|Thus saith Jehovah, The people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
Jeremiah|31|3|, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
Jeremiah|31|4|Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
Jeremiah|31|5|.
Jeremiah|31|6|For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|31|7|For thus saith Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
Jeremiah|31|8|with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither.
Jeremiah|31|9|They shall come with weeping; and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
Jeremiah|31|10|Hear the word of Jehovah, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as shepherd doth his flock.
Jeremiah|31|11|For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
Jeremiah|31|12|And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of Jehovah, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
Jeremiah|31|13|Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
Jeremiah|31|14|And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|15|Thus saith Jehovah: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
Jeremiah|31|16|Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
Jeremiah|31|17|children shall come again to their own border.
Jeremiah|31|18|: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art Jehovah my God.
Jeremiah|31|19|Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
Jeremiah|31|20|Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|21|Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
Jeremiah|31|22|How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.
Jeremiah|31|23|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.
Jeremiah|31|24|And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
Jeremiah|31|25|For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
Jeremiah|31|26|Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
Jeremiah|31|27|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
Jeremiah|31|28|And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|29|In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|30|But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
Jeremiah|31|31|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Jeremiah|31|32|not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|33|But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
Jeremiah|31|34|and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
Jeremiah|31|35|Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:
Jeremiah|31|36|If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
Jeremiah|31|37|Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|31|38|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.
Jeremiah|31|39|And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.
Jeremiah|31|40|
Jeremiah|32|1|The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
Jeremiah|32|2|Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.
Jeremiah|32|3|For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
Jeremiah|32|4|and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
Jeremiah|32|5|and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?
Jeremiah|32|6|And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Jeremiah|32|7|Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
Jeremiah|32|8|So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|32|9|And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
Jeremiah|32|10|And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.
Jeremiah|32|11|the law and custom, and that which was open:
Jeremiah|32|12|, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|32|13|And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
Jeremiah|32|14|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.
Jeremiah|32|15|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.
Jeremiah|32|16|Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|32|17|Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for thee,
Jeremiah|32|18|who showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts is his name;
Jeremiah|32|19|great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:
Jeremiah|32|20|men; and madest thee a name, as at this day;
Jeremiah|32|21|and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
Jeremiah|32|22|and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
Jeremiah|32|23|and they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.
Jeremiah|32|24|Behold, the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
Jeremiah|32|25|And thou hast said unto me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|32|26|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|32|27|Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
Jeremiah|32|28|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:
Jeremiah|32|29|and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
Jeremiah|32|30|For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|32|31|For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
Jeremiah|32|32|because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|32|33|And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.
Jeremiah|32|34|But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
Jeremiah|32|35|unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
Jeremiah|32|36|And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
Jeremiah|32|37|Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
Jeremiah|32|38|and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
Jeremiah|32|39|and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
Jeremiah|32|40|and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.
Jeremiah|32|41|Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
Jeremiah|32|42|For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
Jeremiah|32|43|And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|32|44|
Jeremiah|33|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|33|2|Thus saith Jehovah that doeth it, Jehovah that formeth it to establish it; Jehovah is his name:
Jeremiah|33|3|Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and will show thee great things, and difficult, which thou knowest not.
Jeremiah|33|4|against the mounds and against the sword;
Jeremiah|33|5|come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:
Jeremiah|33|6|Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth.
Jeremiah|33|7|And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
Jeremiah|33|8|And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me.
Jeremiah|33|9|shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.
Jeremiah|33|10|Thus saith Jehovah: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say, It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,
Jeremiah|33|11|thanksgiving into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|33|12|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
Jeremiah|33|13|In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that numbereth them, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|33|14|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
Jeremiah|33|15|In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
Jeremiah|33|16|whereby she shall be called: Jehovah our righteousness.
Jeremiah|33|17|For thus saith Jehovah: David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;
Jeremiah|33|18|neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
Jeremiah|33|19|And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|33|20|Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;
Jeremiah|33|21|then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he shall not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
Jeremiah|33|22|As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.
Jeremiah|33|23|And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|33|24|Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah did choose, he hath cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
Jeremiah|33|25|not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
Jeremiah|33|26|
Jeremiah|34|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying:
Jeremiah|34|2|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:
Jeremiah|34|3|and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
Jeremiah|34|4|Yet hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah: thus saith Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword;
Jeremiah|34|5|, Ah Lord! for I have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|34|6|Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
Jeremiah|34|7|fortified cities.
Jeremiah|34|8|The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;
Jeremiah|34|9|, of a Jew his brother.
Jeremiah|34|10|And all the princes and all the people obeyed, that had entered into the covenant, that every one should let his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, go free, that none should make bondmen of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:
Jeremiah|34|11|but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
Jeremiah|34|12|Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|34|13|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
Jeremiah|34|14|At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
Jeremiah|34|15|And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
Jeremiah|34|16|but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
Jeremiah|34|17|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth.
Jeremiah|34|18|And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof;
Jeremiah|34|19|the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;
Jeremiah|34|20|I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth.
Jeremiah|34|21|And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone away from you.
Jeremiah|34|22|
Jeremiah|35|1|The word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|35|2|Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
Jeremiah|35|3|Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
Jeremiah|35|4|and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
Jeremiah|35|5|And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.
Jeremiah|35|6|But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever:
Jeremiah|35|7|neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn.
Jeremiah|35|8|And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;
Jeremiah|35|9|nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
Jeremiah|35|10|but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
Jeremiah|35|11|But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|35|12|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|35|13|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|35|14|The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and unto this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment: but I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; and ye have not hearkened unto me.
Jeremiah|35|15|I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
Jeremiah|35|16|Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;
Jeremiah|35|17|therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
Jeremiah|35|18|And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;
Jeremiah|35|19|
Jeremiah|36|1|And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Jeremiah|36|2|Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.
Jeremiah|36|3|It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Jeremiah|36|4|Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.
Jeremiah|36|5|And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of Jehovah:
Jeremiah|36|6|therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house upon the fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.
Jeremiah|36|7|It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people.
Jeremiah|36|8|And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah’s house.
Jeremiah|36|9|Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Jehovah.
Jeremiah|36|10|Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Jehovah’s house, in the ears of all the people.
Jeremiah|36|11|And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah,
Jeremiah|36|12|, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
Jeremiah|36|13|Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
Jeremiah|36|14|Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.
Jeremiah|36|15|And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
Jeremiah|36|16|Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
Jeremiah|36|17|And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
Jeremiah|36|18|Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
Jeremiah|36|19|Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are.
Jeremiah|36|20|And they went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.
Jeremiah|36|21|So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.
Jeremiah|36|22|the brazier burning before him.
Jeremiah|36|23|cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
Jeremiah|36|24|And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.
Jeremiah|36|25|Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but he would not hear them.
Jeremiah|36|26|And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah hid them.
Jeremiah|36|27|Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|36|28|Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.
Jeremiah|36|29|And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
Jeremiah|36|30|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
Jeremiah|36|31|And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.
Jeremiah|36|32|
Jeremiah|37|1|And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah|37|2|But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of Jehovah, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|37|3|And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.
Jeremiah|37|4|Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.
Jeremiah|37|5|And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that were besieging Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they brake up from Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|37|6|Then came the word of Jehovah unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|37|7|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
Jeremiah|37|8|And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.
Jeremiah|37|9|Thus saith Jehovah, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.
Jeremiah|37|10|For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yea would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
Jeremiah|37|11|And it came to pass that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,
Jeremiah|37|12|then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people.
Jeremiah|37|13|And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou art falling away to the Chaldeans.
Jeremiah|37|14|Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
Jeremiah|37|15|And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
Jeremiah|37|16|When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
Jeremiah|37|17|Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|37|18|Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?
Jeremiah|37|19|Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
Jeremiah|37|20|And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
Jeremiah|37|21|
Jeremiah|38|1|And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying,
Jeremiah|38|2|Thus saith Jehovah, He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live.
Jeremiah|38|3|Thus saith Jehovah, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
Jeremiah|38|4|Then the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
Jeremiah|38|5|And Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do anything against you.
Jeremiah|38|6|Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
Jeremiah|38|7|Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)
Jeremiah|38|8|Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,
Jeremiah|38|9|My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.
Jeremiah|38|10|Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
Jeremiah|38|11|So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|38|12|And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
Jeremiah|38|13|So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
Jeremiah|38|14|Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
Jeremiah|38|15|Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.
Jeremiah|38|16|So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
Jeremiah|38|17|Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.
Jeremiah|38|18|But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
Jeremiah|38|19|And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
Jeremiah|38|20|But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.
Jeremiah|38|21|But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me:
Jeremiah|38|22|thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.
Jeremiah|38|23|And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
Jeremiah|38|24|Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
Jeremiah|38|25|But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
Jeremiah|38|26|then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.
Jeremiah|38|27|Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
Jeremiah|38|28|
Jeremiah|39|1|And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;
Jeremiah|39|2|in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city,)
Jeremiah|39|3|, Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|39|4|And it came to pass that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah.
Jeremiah|39|5|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.
Jeremiah|39|6|Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah|39|7|Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
Jeremiah|39|8|And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.
Jeremiah|39|9|Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also that fell away to him, and the residue of the people that remained.
Jeremiah|39|10|But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
Jeremiah|39|11|Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|39|12|Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
Jeremiah|39|13|So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;
Jeremiah|39|14|they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
Jeremiah|39|15|Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Jeremiah|39|16|Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day.
Jeremiah|39|17|But I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.
Jeremiah|39|18|
Jeremiah|40|1|The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon.
Jeremiah|40|2|And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place;
Jeremiah|40|3|and Jehovah hath brought it, and done according as he spake: because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.
Jeremiah|40|4|And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.
Jeremiah|40|5|, to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a present, and let him go.
Jeremiah|40|6|Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
Jeremiah|40|7|Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
Jeremiah|40|8|, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
Jeremiah|40|9|And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
Jeremiah|40|10|As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that shall come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
Jeremiah|40|11|Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;
Jeremiah|40|12|then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
Jeremiah|40|13|Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
Jeremiah|40|14|and said unto him, Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
Jeremiah|40|15|Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
Jeremiah|40|16|
Jeremiah|41|1|the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.
Jeremiah|41|2|Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
Jeremiah|41|3|, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, the men of war.
Jeremiah|41|4|And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,
Jeremiah|41|5|that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|41|6|And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
Jeremiah|41|7|into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.
Jeremiah|41|8|But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
Jeremiah|41|9|Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel,) Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
Jeremiah|41|10|Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
Jeremiah|41|11|But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
Jeremiah|41|12|then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
Jeremiah|41|13|Now it came to pass that, when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.
Jeremiah|41|14|So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
Jeremiah|41|15|But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
Jeremiah|41|16|, the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:
Jeremiah|41|17|and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
Jeremiah|41|18|
Jeremiah|42|1|Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
Jeremiah|42|2|and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we pray thee, our supplication be presented before thee, and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:
Jeremiah|42|3|that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
Jeremiah|42|4|Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.
Jeremiah|42|5|Then they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us, if we do not according to all the word wherewith Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.
Jeremiah|42|6|Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.
Jeremiah|42|7|And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.
Jeremiah|42|8|Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
Jeremiah|42|9|and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:
Jeremiah|42|10|If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.
Jeremiah|42|11|Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
Jeremiah|42|12|And I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.
Jeremiah|42|13|But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so that ye obey not the voice of Jehovah your God,
Jeremiah|42|14|saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
Jeremiah|42|15|now therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, If ye indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
Jeremiah|42|16|then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
Jeremiah|42|17|So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
Jeremiah|42|18|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
Jeremiah|42|19|Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified unto you this day.
Jeremiah|42|20|For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it:
Jeremiah|42|21|and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.
Jeremiah|42|22|
Jeremiah|43|1|And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, wherewith Jehovah their God had sent him to them, even all these words,
Jeremiah|43|2|then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
Jeremiah|43|3|but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.
Jeremiah|43|4|So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.
Jeremiah|43|5|But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;
Jeremiah|43|6|the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;
Jeremiah|43|7|and they came into the land of Egypt; for they obeyed not the voice of Jehovah: and they came unto Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah|43|8|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Jeremiah|43|9|Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in mortar in the brickwork, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
Jeremiah|43|10|and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
Jeremiah|43|11|to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
Jeremiah|43|12|And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
Jeremiah|43|13|
Jeremiah|44|1|The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that dwelt at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
Jeremiah|44|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
Jeremiah|44|3|to serve other gods, that they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers.
Jeremiah|44|4|Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
Jeremiah|44|5|But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
Jeremiah|44|6|Wherefore my wrath and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|7|great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;
Jeremiah|44|8|in that ye provoke me unto anger with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
Jeremiah|44|9|Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jeremiah|44|10|They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
Jeremiah|44|11|Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.
Jeremiah|44|12|an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
Jeremiah|44|13|For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
Jeremiah|44|14|so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.
Jeremiah|44|15|Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
Jeremiah|44|16|As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee.
Jeremiah|44|17|But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
Jeremiah|44|18|But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven, and pouring out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
Jeremiah|44|19|And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?
Jeremiah|44|20|Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying,
Jeremiah|44|21|The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and came it not into his mind?
Jeremiah|44|22|so that Jehovah could not longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|23|Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as it is this day.
Jeremiah|44|24|Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:
Jeremiah|44|25|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.
Jeremiah|44|26|Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Lord Jehovah liveth.
Jeremiah|44|27|Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
Jeremiah|44|28|And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
Jeremiah|44|29|And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
Jeremiah|44|30|
Jeremiah|45|1|The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these word in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Jeremiah|45|2|Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:
Jeremiah|45|3|Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
Jeremiah|45|4|Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
Jeremiah|45|5|
Jeremiah|46|1|The word of Jehovah which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
Jeremiah|46|2|Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
Jeremiah|46|3|Prepare ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
Jeremiah|46|4|Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.

Jeremiah|51|29|And the land trembleth and is in pain; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|51|30|The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might hath failed; they are become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.
Jeremiah|51|31|One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to met another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:
Jeremiah|51|32|and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
Jeremiah|51|33|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for her.
Jeremiah|51|34|Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath, like a monster, swallowed me up, he hath filled his maw with my delicacies; he hath cast me out.
Jeremiah|51|35|The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
Jeremiah|51|36|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.
Jeremiah|51|37|And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
Jeremiah|51|38|They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions’ whelps.
Jeremiah|51|39|When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|51|40|I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.
Jeremiah|51|41|How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
Jeremiah|51|42|The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
Jeremiah|51|43|Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.
Jeremiah|51|44|And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
Jeremiah|51|45|My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Jeremiah|51|46|tidings, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
Jeremiah|51|47|Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
Jeremiah|51|48|Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|51|49|As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.
Jeremiah|51|50|Ye that have escaped the sword, go ye, stand not still; remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
Jeremiah|51|51|We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah’s house.
Jeremiah|51|52|Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will execute judgment upon her graven images; and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
Jeremiah|51|53|Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, saith Jehovah.
Jeremiah|51|54|The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
Jeremiah|51|55|For Jehovah layeth Babylon waste, and destroyeth out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:
Jeremiah|51|56|for the destroyer is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Jehovah is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.
Jeremiah|51|57|And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.
Jeremiah|51|58|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.
Jeremiah|51|59|The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.
Jeremiah|51|60|And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
Jeremiah|51|61|And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, then see that thou read all these words,
Jeremiah|51|62|and say, O Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
Jeremiah|51|63|And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:
Jeremiah|51|64|
Jeremiah|52|1|Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
Jeremiah|52|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
Jeremiah|52|3|For through the anger of Jehovah did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Jeremiah|52|4|And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
Jeremiah|52|5|So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
Jeremiah|52|6|In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
Jeremiah|52|7|Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;) and they went toward the Arabah.
Jeremiah|52|8|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
Jeremiah|52|9|Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave judgment upon him.
Jeremiah|52|10|And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
Jeremiah|52|11|And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
Jeremiah|52|12|Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:
Jeremiah|52|13|and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned he with fire.
Jeremiah|52|14|And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
Jeremiah|52|15|Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
Jeremiah|52|16|But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
Jeremiah|52|17|And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
Jeremiah|52|18|The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
Jeremiah|52|19|And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls-that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,- the captain of the guard took away.
Jeremiah|52|20|The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
Jeremiah|52|21|And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
Jeremiah|52|22|And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.
Jeremiah|52|23|And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.
Jeremiah|52|24|And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:
Jeremiah|52|25|and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king’s face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
Jeremiah|52|26|And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
Jeremiah|52|27|And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.
Jeremiah|52|28|This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;
Jeremiah|52|29|in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons;
Jeremiah|52|30|in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
Jeremiah|52|31|year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;
Jeremiah|52|32|and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
Jeremiah|52|33|did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:
Jeremiah|52|34|
Isaiah|1|1|The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Isaiah|1|2|Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
Isaiah|1|3|Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
Isaiah|1|4|backward.
Isaiah|1|5|Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
Isaiah|1|6|wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.
Isaiah|1|7|Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
Isaiah|1|8|And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
Isaiah|1|9|Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
Isaiah|1|10|Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
Isaiah|1|11|What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
Isaiah|1|12|When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
Isaiah|1|13|Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.
Isaiah|1|14|Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.
Isaiah|1|15|And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
Isaiah|1|16|Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
Isaiah|1|17|learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
Isaiah|1|18|Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
Isaiah|1|19|If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
Isaiah|1|20|but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.
Isaiah|1|21|How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
Isaiah|1|22|Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
Isaiah|1|23|Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
Isaiah|1|24|Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;
Isaiah|1|25|and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;
Isaiah|1|26|and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.
Isaiah|1|27|Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.
Isaiah|1|28|But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.
Isaiah|1|29|For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
Isaiah|1|30|For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
Isaiah|1|31|
Isaiah|2|1|The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
Isaiah|2|2|And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
Isaiah|2|3|And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
Isaiah|2|4|And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Isaiah|2|5|O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
Isaiah|2|6|soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
Isaiah|2|7|And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
Isaiah|2|8|Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
Isaiah|2|9|And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low: therefore forgive them not.
Isaiah|2|10|Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.
Isaiah|2|11|The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
Isaiah|2|12|For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;
Isaiah|2|13|and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
Isaiah|2|14|and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
Isaiah|2|15|and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,
Isaiah|2|16|and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.
Isaiah|2|17|And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
Isaiah|2|18|And the idols shall utterly pass away.
Isaiah|2|19|And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
Isaiah|2|20|In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
Isaiah|2|21|to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
Isaiah|2|22|
Isaiah|3|1|For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;
Isaiah|3|2|the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;
Isaiah|3|3|the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.
Isaiah|3|4|And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
Isaiah|3|5|And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
Isaiah|3|6|, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;
Isaiah|3|7|, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.
Isaiah|3|8|For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
Isaiah|3|9|The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.
Isaiah|3|10|; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Isaiah|3|11|; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.
Isaiah|3|12|As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
Isaiah|3|13|Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.
Isaiah|3|14|Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:
Isaiah|3|15|what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|3|16|Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;
Isaiah|3|17|therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.
Isaiah|3|18|In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;
Isaiah|3|19|the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;
Isaiah|3|20|the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;
Isaiah|3|21|the rings, and the nose-jewels;
Isaiah|3|22|the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;
Isaiah|3|23|the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.
Isaiah|3|24|And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.
Isaiah|3|25|Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
Isaiah|3|26|
Isaiah|4|1|And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.
Isaiah|4|2|In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
Isaiah|4|3|And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;
Isaiah|4|4|when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
Isaiah|4|5|a covering.
Isaiah|4|6|
Isaiah|5|1|Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
Isaiah|5|2|and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
Isaiah|5|3|And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
Isaiah|5|4|What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
Isaiah|5|5|And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
Isaiah|5|6|and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
Isaiah|5|7|For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.
Isaiah|5|8|Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
Isaiah|5|9|Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
Isaiah|5|10|an ephah.
Isaiah|5|11|Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!
Isaiah|5|12|their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
Isaiah|5|13|Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
Isaiah|5|14|.
Isaiah|5|15|And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:
Isaiah|5|16|but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
Isaiah|5|17|Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.
Isaiah|5|18|Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;
Isaiah|5|19|that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
Isaiah|5|20|Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
Isaiah|5|21|Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Isaiah|5|22|Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;
Isaiah|5|23|that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
Isaiah|5|24|Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|5|25|Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|5|26|And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.
Isaiah|5|27|None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Isaiah|5|28|whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:
Isaiah|5|29|their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.
Isaiah|5|30|
Isaiah|6|1|In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
Isaiah|6|2|Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
Isaiah|6|3|And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
Isaiah|6|4|And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Isaiah|6|5|Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|6|6|Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
Isaiah|6|7|and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.
Isaiah|6|8|And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
Isaiah|6|9|And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
Isaiah|6|10|Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
Isaiah|6|11|Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,
Isaiah|6|12|and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
Isaiah|6|13|
Isaiah|7|1|And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
Isaiah|7|2|And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
Isaiah|7|3|Then said Jehovah unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller’s field;
Isaiah|7|4|and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
Isaiah|7|5|Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,
Isaiah|7|6|Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;
Isaiah|7|7|thus saith the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
Isaiah|7|8|For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people:
Isaiah|7|9|and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
Isaiah|7|10|And Jehovah spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
Isaiah|7|11|Ask thee a sign of Jehovah thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
Isaiah|7|12|But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt Jehovah.
Isaiah|7|13|And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?
Isaiah|7|14|Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
Isaiah|7|15|Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
Isaiah|7|16|For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken.
Isaiah|7|17|the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|7|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isaiah|7|19|And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.
Isaiah|7|20|with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard.
Isaiah|7|21|And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;
Isaiah|7|22|and it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land.
Isaiah|7|23|And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall be for briers and thorns.
Isaiah|7|24|With arrows and with bow shall one come thither, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.
Isaiah|7|25|
Isaiah|8|1|And Jehovah said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
Isaiah|8|2|and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
Isaiah|8|3|And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said Jehovah unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
Isaiah|8|4|For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|8|5|And Jehovah spake unto me yet again, saying,
Isaiah|8|6|Forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;
Isaiah|8|7|the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks;
Isaiah|8|8|and it shall sweep onward into Judah; it shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
Isaiah|8|9|Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.
Isaiah|8|10|Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
Isaiah|8|11|For Jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
Isaiah|8|12|.
Isaiah|8|13|Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
Isaiah|8|14|And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isaiah|8|15|And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
Isaiah|8|16|Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
Isaiah|8|17|And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
Isaiah|8|18|Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.
Isaiah|8|19|unto the dead?
Isaiah|8|20|To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
Isaiah|8|21|And they shall pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward:
Isaiah|8|22|
Isaiah|9|1|But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
Isaiah|9|2|The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
Isaiah|9|3|Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
Isaiah|9|4|For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.
Isaiah|9|5|For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.
Isaiah|9|6|For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
Isaiah|9|7|Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah|9|8|The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
Isaiah|9|9|Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart,
Isaiah|9|10|The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
Isaiah|9|11|Therefore Jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
Isaiah|9|12|the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|9|13|Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought Jehovah of hosts.
Isaiah|9|14|Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.
Isaiah|9|15|The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
Isaiah|9|16|For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
Isaiah|9|17|Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|9|18|For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
Isaiah|9|19|Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.
Isaiah|9|20|And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
Isaiah|9|21|
Isaiah|10|1|Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write perverseness;
Isaiah|10|2|to turn aside the needy from justice, and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
Isaiah|10|3|And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
Isaiah|10|4|They shall only bow down under the prisoners, and shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isaiah|10|5|Ho Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, the staff in whose hand is mine indignation!
Isaiah|10|6|I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
Isaiah|10|7|Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
Isaiah|10|8|For he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings?
Isaiah|10|9|Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
Isaiah|10|10|As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
Isaiah|10|11|shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
Isaiah|10|12|Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
Isaiah|10|13|:
Isaiah|10|14|and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.
Isaiah|10|15|not wood.
Isaiah|10|16|Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.
Isaiah|10|17|And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
Isaiah|10|18|And he will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and it shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
Isaiah|10|19|And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child may write them.
Isaiah|10|20|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again lean upon him that smote them, but shall lean upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
Isaiah|10|21|the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
Isaiah|10|22|determined, overflowing with righteousness.
Isaiah|10|23|For a full end, and that determined, will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth.
Isaiah|10|24|Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
Isaiah|10|25|to his destruction.
Isaiah|10|26|And Jehovah of hosts will stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
Isaiah|10|27|And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.
Isaiah|10|28|He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmash he layeth up his baggage;

Isaiah|19|10|grieved in soul.
Isaiah|19|11|The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
Isaiah|19|12|Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.
Isaiah|19|13|The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.

Isaiah|22|2|O thou that art full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.
Isaiah|22|3|All thy rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all that were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.
Isaiah|22|4|Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

Isaiah|22|17|man, will hurl thee away violently; yea, he will wrap thee up closely.

Isaiah|25|1|truth.
Isaiah|25|2|For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
Isaiah|25|3|Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
Isaiah|25|4|For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

Isaiah|26|2|Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.
Isaiah|26|3|; because he trusteth in thee.
Isaiah|26|4|Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.

Isaiah|26|15|Thou hast increased the nation, O Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.
Isaiah|26|16|thy chastening was upon them.
Isaiah|26|17|Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O Jehovah.
Isaiah|26|18|We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
Isaiah|26|19|the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.
Isaiah|26|20|Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
Isaiah|26|21|
Isaiah|27|1|In that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.

Isaiah|27|6|In days to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.
Isaiah|27|7|Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them?
Isaiah|27|8|with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.
Isaiah|27|9|the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.
Isaiah|27|10|For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
Isaiah|27|11|When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no favor.
Isaiah|27|12|from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
Isaiah|27|13|
Isaiah|28|1|Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine!
Isaiah|28|2|Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one; as a tempest of hail, a destroying storm, as a tempest of mighty waters overflowing, will he cast down to the earth with the hand.
Isaiah|28|3|The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot:
Isaiah|28|4|and the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
Isaiah|28|5|In that day will Jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people;
Isaiah|28|6|and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment, and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate.
Isaiah|28|7|And even these reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they stagger with strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
Isaiah|28|8|.
Isaiah|28|9|Whom will he teach knowledge? and whom will he make to understand the message? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
Isaiah|28|10|For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.
Isaiah|28|11|strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people;
Isaiah|28|12|to whom he said, This is the rest, give ye rest to him that is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
Isaiah|28|13|Therefore shall the word of Jehovah be unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
Isaiah|28|14|Wherefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scoffers, that rule this people that is in Jerusalem:
Isaiah|28|15|Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
Isaiah|28|16|of sure foundation: he that believeth shall not be in haste.
Isaiah|28|17|And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
Isaiah|28|18|And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
Isaiah|28|19|As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night: and it shall be nought but terror to understand the message.
Isaiah|28|20|For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
Isaiah|28|21|For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
Isaiah|28|22|Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for a decree of destruction have I heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, upon the whole earth.
Isaiah|28|23|Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
Isaiah|28|24|open and harrow his ground?
Isaiah|28|25|When he hath levelled the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in the border thereof?
Isaiah|28|26|doth teach him.
Isaiah|28|27|instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
Isaiah|28|28|is ground; for he will not be always threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he doth not grind it.
Isaiah|28|29|
Isaiah|29|1|Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:
Isaiah|29|2|then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.
Isaiah|29|3|And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.
Isaiah|29|4|And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
Isaiah|29|5|But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.
Isaiah|29|6|She shall be visited of Jehovah of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
Isaiah|29|7|And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
Isaiah|29|8|And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
Isaiah|29|9|Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
Isaiah|29|10|For Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.
Isaiah|29|11|And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed:
Isaiah|29|12|and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.
Isaiah|29|13|;
Isaiah|29|14|therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
Isaiah|29|15|Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from Jehovah, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
Isaiah|29|16|Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?
Isaiah|29|17|Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
Isaiah|29|18|And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
Isaiah|29|19|The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|29|20|For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;
Isaiah|29|21|cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.
Isaiah|29|22|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
Isaiah|29|23|But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.
Isaiah|29|24|
Isaiah|30|1|Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, that take counsel, but not of me; and that make a league, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,
Isaiah|30|2|that set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
Isaiah|30|3|Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
Isaiah|30|4|For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors are come to Hanes.
Isaiah|30|5|They shall all be ashamed because of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
Isaiah|30|6|.
Isaiah|30|7|For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab that sitteth still.
Isaiah|30|8|Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
Isaiah|30|9|For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of Jehovah;
Isaiah|30|10|that say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits,
Isaiah|30|11|get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
Isaiah|30|12|Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;
Isaiah|30|13|therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant.
Isaiah|30|14|And he shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd wherewith to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.
Isaiah|30|15|For thus said the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. And ye would not:
Isaiah|30|16|but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
Isaiah|30|17|at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
Isaiah|30|18|And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for Jehovah is a God of justice; blessed are all they that wait for him.
Isaiah|30|19|For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; thou shalt weep no more; he will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear, he will answer thee.
Isaiah|30|20|And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers;
Isaiah|30|21|and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Isaiah|30|22|And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as an unclean thing; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
Isaiah|30|23|And he will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures;
Isaiah|30|24|the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
Isaiah|30|25|streams of waters, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Isaiah|30|26|Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
Isaiah|30|27|Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;
Isaiah|30|28|in the jaws of the peoples.
Isaiah|30|29|Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.
Isaiah|30|30|anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.
Isaiah|30|31|.
Isaiah|30|32|will he fight with them.
Isaiah|30|33|
Isaiah|31|1|Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!
Isaiah|31|2|Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
Isaiah|31|3|Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit: and when Jehovah shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall be consumed together.
Isaiah|31|4|For thus saith Jehovah unto me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so will Jehovah of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.
Isaiah|31|5|.
Isaiah|31|6|Turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.
Isaiah|31|7|For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
Isaiah|31|8|And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become subject to taskwork.
Isaiah|31|9|
Isaiah|32|1|Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.
Isaiah|32|2|And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest, as streams of water in a dry place, as the shade of a great rock in a weary land.
Isaiah|32|3|And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
Isaiah|32|4|And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
Isaiah|32|5|The fool shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
Isaiah|32|6|For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
Isaiah|32|7|And the instruments of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
Isaiah|32|8|But the noble deviseth noble things; and in noble things shall he continue.
Isaiah|32|9|hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.
Isaiah|32|10|For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.
Isaiah|32|11|upon your loins.
Isaiah|32|12|They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
Isaiah|32|13|Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.
Isaiah|32|14|For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
Isaiah|32|15|until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest.
Isaiah|32|16|Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.
Isaiah|32|17|And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence for ever.
Isaiah|32|18|And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.
Isaiah|32|19|But it shall hail in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low.
Isaiah|32|20|
Isaiah|33|1|Woe to thee that destroyest, and thou wast not destroyed; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to destroy, thou shalt be destroyed; and when thou hast made an end of dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
Isaiah|33|2|O Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou our arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
Isaiah|33|3|At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.
Isaiah|33|4|And your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth: as locusts leap shall men leap upon it.
Isaiah|33|5|Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
Isaiah|33|6|And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah is thy treasure.
Isaiah|33|7|Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
Isaiah|33|8|hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.
Isaiah|33|9|.
Isaiah|33|10|Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.
Isaiah|33|11|Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
Isaiah|33|12|And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.
Isaiah|33|13|Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
Isaiah|33|14|The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the godless ones: Who among us can dwell with the devouring fire? who among us can dwell with everlasting burnings?
Isaiah|33|15|He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from taking a bribe, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil:
Isaiah|33|16|; his waters shall be sure.
Isaiah|33|17|Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a land that reacheth afar.
Isaiah|33|18|? where is he that counted the towers?
Isaiah|33|19|Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend, of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.
Isaiah|33|20|Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
Isaiah|33|21|But there Jehovah will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
Isaiah|33|22|For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.
Isaiah|33|23|Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.
Isaiah|33|24|
Isaiah|34|1|Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.
Isaiah|34|2|For Jehovah hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
Isaiah|34|3|Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
Isaiah|34|4|from the fig-tree.
Isaiah|34|5|For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
Isaiah|34|6|The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
Isaiah|34|7|And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
Isaiah|34|8|For Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
Isaiah|34|9|shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
Isaiah|34|10|It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
Isaiah|34|11|But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
Isaiah|34|12|They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.
Isaiah|34|13|And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.
Isaiah|34|14|And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.
Isaiah|34|15|There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.
Isaiah|34|16|Seek ye out of the book of Jehovah, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.
Isaiah|34|17|
Isaiah|35|1|The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
Isaiah|35|2|It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
Isaiah|35|3|Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Isaiah|35|4|the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
Isaiah|35|5|Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Isaiah|35|6|Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
Isaiah|35|7|And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
Isaiah|35|8|.
Isaiah|35|9|:
Isaiah|35|10|
Isaiah|36|1|Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
Isaiah|36|2|And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
Isaiah|36|3|Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
Isaiah|36|4|And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
Isaiah|36|5|counsel and strength for the war are but vain words: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
Isaiah|36|6|Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
Isaiah|36|7|But if thou say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
Isaiah|36|8|Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
Isaiah|36|9|How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isaiah|36|10|And am I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Isaiah|36|11|Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
Isaiah|36|12|to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
Isaiah|36|13|Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|14|Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you:
Isaiah|36|15|neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|36|16|Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Isaiah|36|17|until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Isaiah|36|18|Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isaiah|36|19|Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|20|Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
Isaiah|36|21|But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Isaiah|36|22|
Isaiah|37|1|And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|2|And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
Isaiah|37|3|And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
Isaiah|37|4|It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
Isaiah|37|5|So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isaiah|37|6|And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Isaiah|37|7|Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
Isaiah|37|8|So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
Isaiah|37|9|And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come out to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isaiah|37|10|Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isaiah|37|11|Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
Isaiah|37|12|Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
Isaiah|37|13|Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
Isaiah|37|14|And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|15|And Hezekiah prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
Isaiah|37|16|the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
Isaiah|37|17|Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to defy the living God.
Isaiah|37|18|Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
Isaiah|37|19|and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
Isaiah|37|20|Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, even thou only.
Isaiah|37|21|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
Isaiah|37|22|this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
Isaiah|37|23|against the Holy One of Israel.
Isaiah|37|24|By thy servants hast thou defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field;
Isaiah|37|25|I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
Isaiah|37|26|Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
Isaiah|37|27|before it is grown up.
Isaiah|37|28|But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
Isaiah|37|29|Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
Isaiah|37|30|And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
Isaiah|37|31|And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
Isaiah|37|32|For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.
Isaiah|37|33|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
Isaiah|37|34|By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|37|35|For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
Isaiah|37|36|And the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
Isaiah|37|37|So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
Isaiah|37|38|
Isaiah|38|1|In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
Isaiah|38|2|Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah,
Isaiah|38|3|and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
Isaiah|38|4|Then came the word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,
Isaiah|38|5|Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
Isaiah|38|6|And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.
Isaiah|38|7|And this shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:

Isaiah|38|21|Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
Isaiah|38|22|
Isaiah|39|1|At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
Isaiah|39|2|And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
Isaiah|39|3|Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
Isaiah|39|4|Then said he, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
Isaiah|39|5|Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:
Isaiah|39|6|Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|39|7|And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.

Isaiah|40|2|Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovah’s hand double for all her sins.
Isaiah|40|3|The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God.
Isaiah|40|4|Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain:
Isaiah|40|5|and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.
Isaiah|40|6|The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.
Isaiah|40|7|The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.
Isaiah|40|8|The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.
Isaiah|40|9|O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!

Isaiah|52|15|
Isaiah|53|1|Who hath believed our message? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed?

Isaiah|56|8|to him, besides his own that are gathered.
Isaiah|56|9|, all ye beasts in the forest.
Isaiah|56|10|His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
Isaiah|56|11|Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.
Isaiah|56|12|
Isaiah|57|1|.
Isaiah|57|2|He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.
Isaiah|57|3|But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
Isaiah|57|4|Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
Isaiah|57|5|ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
Isaiah|57|6|of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?
Isaiah|57|7|Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
Isaiah|57|8|to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
Isaiah|57|9|And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.

Isaiah|57|16|For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.
Isaiah|57|17|and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
Isaiah|57|18|I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

Isaiah|57|21|
Isaiah|58|1|Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
Isaiah|58|2|Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.
Isaiah|58|3|pleasure, and exact all your labors.
Isaiah|58|4|Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
Isaiah|58|5|Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?
Isaiah|58|6|Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
Isaiah|58|7|Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
Isaiah|58|8|Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.
Isaiah|58|9|Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;

Isaiah|58|13|words:
Isaiah|58|14|
Isaiah|59|1|Behold, Jehovah’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
Isaiah|59|2|but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.
Isaiah|59|3|For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.
Isaiah|59|4|None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
Isaiah|59|5|They hatch adders’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
Isaiah|59|6|Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
Isaiah|59|7|Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.
Isaiah|59|8|The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.
Isaiah|59|9|Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
Isaiah|59|10|We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.
Isaiah|59|11|We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
Isaiah|59|12|For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
Isaiah|59|13|transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
Isaiah|59|14|And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
Isaiah|59|15|Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
Isaiah|59|16|And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.
Isaiah|59|17|And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
Isaiah|59|18|According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.
Isaiah|59|19|So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.
Isaiah|59|20|And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|59|21|
Isaiah|60|1|Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.

Isaiah|60|4|Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.

Isaiah|63|2|Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?
Isaiah|63|3|I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.
Isaiah|63|4|For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
Isaiah|63|5|And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my wrath, it upheld me.
Isaiah|63|6|And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
Isaiah|63|7|the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

Isaiah|63|17|O Jehovah, why dost thou make us to err from thy ways, and hardenest our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.
Isaiah|63|18|but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
Isaiah|63|19|
Isaiah|64|1|Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,
Isaiah|64|2|the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
Isaiah|64|3|When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.
Isaiah|64|4|For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.
Isaiah|64|5|of long time; and shall we be saved?
Isaiah|64|6|For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
Isaiah|64|7|And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
Isaiah|64|8|But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
Isaiah|64|9|Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
Isaiah|64|10|Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Isaiah|64|11|Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
Isaiah|64|12|
Isaiah|65|1|; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
Isaiah|65|2|I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
Isaiah|65|3|a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;
Isaiah|65|4|that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
Isaiah|65|5|that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
Isaiah|65|6|Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,
Isaiah|65|7|your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.
Isaiah|65|8|Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.
Isaiah|65|9|And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
Isaiah|65|10|And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
Isaiah|65|11|But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;
Isaiah|65|12|I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.
Isaiah|65|13|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;
Isaiah|65|14|behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
Isaiah|65|15|And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; and the Lord Jehovah will slay thee; and he will call his servants by another name:
Isaiah|65|16|so that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
Isaiah|65|17|For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
Isaiah|65|18|But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
Isaiah|65|19|And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.
Isaiah|65|20|There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
Isaiah|65|21|And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
Isaiah|65|22|They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
Isaiah|65|23|They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
Isaiah|65|24|And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
Isaiah|65|25|
Isaiah|66|1|Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?
Isaiah|66|2|all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.
Isaiah|66|3|swine’s blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:
Isaiah|66|4|I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.
Isaiah|66|5|Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.
Isaiah|66|6|A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.
Isaiah|66|7|Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.
Isaiah|66|8|Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
Isaiah|66|9|? saith thy God.
Isaiah|66|10|Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;
Isaiah|66|11|that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
Isaiah|66|12|; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.
Isaiah|66|13|As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
Isaiah|66|14|, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.
Isaiah|66|15|For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
Isaiah|66|16|For by fire will Jehovah execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.
Isaiah|66|17|unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|18|cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.
Isaiah|66|19|And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
Isaiah|66|20|And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|21|for Levites, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|22|For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.
Isaiah|66|23|And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith Jehovah.
Isaiah|66|24|

2 Chronicles|1|1|And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
2 Chronicles|1|2|.
2 Chronicles|1|3|So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles|1|4|that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|5|Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah: and Solomon and the assembly sought unto it.
2 Chronicles|1|6|
2 Chronicles|1|7|In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
2 Chronicles|1|8|And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great lovingkindness unto David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.
2 Chronicles|1|9|Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
2 Chronicles|1|10|Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
2 Chronicles|1|11|And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of them that hate thee, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
2 Chronicles|1|12|wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee; neither shall there any after thee have the like.
2 Chronicles|1|13|So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, unto Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles|1|14|And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|1|15|And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
2 Chronicles|1|16|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
2 Chronicles|1|17|
2 Chronicles|2|1|Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|2|And Solomon counted out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand men that were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
2 Chronicles|2|3|.
2 Chronicles|2|4|for ever to Israel.
2 Chronicles|2|5|And the house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
2 Chronicles|2|6|But who is able to build him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, save only to burn incense before him?
2 Chronicles|2|7|with the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
2 Chronicles|2|8|Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
2 Chronicles|2|9|even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
2 Chronicles|2|10|And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2 Chronicles|2|11|Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loveth his people, he hath made thee king over them.
2 Chronicles|2|12|Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
2 Chronicles|2|13|And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,
2 Chronicles|2|14|appointed unto him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.
2 Chronicles|2|15|Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
2 Chronicles|2|16|and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need; and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|2|17|And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
2 Chronicles|2|18|
2 Chronicles|3|1|appeared unto David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 Chronicles|3|2|of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles|3|3|Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|4|, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
2 Chronicles|3|5|And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm-trees and chains.
2 Chronicles|3|6|And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2 Chronicles|3|7|He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.
2 Chronicles|3|8|And he made the most holy house: the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2 Chronicles|3|9|And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|10|And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.
2 Chronicles|3|11|five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|12|, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles|3|13|The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
2 Chronicles|3|14|And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.
2 Chronicles|3|15|Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
2 Chronicles|3|16|on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
2 Chronicles|3|17|
2 Chronicles|4|1|Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
2 Chronicles|4|2|Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
2 Chronicles|4|3|And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
2 Chronicles|4|4|It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
2 Chronicles|4|5|And it was a handbreadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.
2 Chronicles|4|6|He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2 Chronicles|4|7|And he made the ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
2 Chronicles|4|8|He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
2 Chronicles|4|9|Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
2 Chronicles|4|10|eastward, toward the south.
2 Chronicles|4|11|And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:
2 Chronicles|4|12|the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
2 Chronicles|4|13|and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.
2 Chronicles|4|14|He made also the bases, and the lavers made he upon the bases;
2 Chronicles|4|15|one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
2 Chronicles|4|16|The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels thereof, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah of bright brass.
2 Chronicles|4|17|In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles|4|18|Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2 Chronicles|4|19|And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon was the showbread;
2 Chronicles|4|20|and the candlesticks with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
2 Chronicles|4|21|and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;
2 Chronicles|4|22|
2 Chronicles|5|1|Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|5|2|of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
2 Chronicles|5|3|the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|5|4|And all the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;
2 Chronicles|5|5|and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.
2 Chronicles|5|6|And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
2 Chronicles|5|7|And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
2 Chronicles|5|8|For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
2 Chronicles|5|9|And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there it is unto this day.
2 Chronicles|5|10|at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|5|11|And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their courses;
2 Chronicles|5|12|also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brethren, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)
2 Chronicles|5|13|for ever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|5|14|
2 Chronicles|6|1|Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
2 Chronicles|6|2|But I have built thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in for ever.
2 Chronicles|6|3|And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
2 Chronicles|6|4|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hands fulfilled it, saying,
2 Chronicles|6|5|Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel:
2 Chronicles|6|6|but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|7|Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|8|But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
2 Chronicles|6|9|nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
2 Chronicles|6|10|And Jehovah hath performed his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|11|And there have I set the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|6|12|And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands
2 Chronicles|6|13|(for Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;)
2 Chronicles|6|14|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;
2 Chronicles|6|15|who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
2 Chronicles|6|16|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me.
2 Chronicles|6|17|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David.
2 Chronicles|6|18|But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have builded!
2 Chronicles|6|19|Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee;
2 Chronicles|6|20|that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
2 Chronicles|6|21|And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest forgive.
2 Chronicles|6|22|swear before thine altar in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|23|then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
2 Chronicles|6|24|And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
2 Chronicles|6|25|then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|26|When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:
2 Chronicles|6|27|then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
2 Chronicles|6|28|If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there be;
2 Chronicles|6|29|what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|30|then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of the children of men;)
2 Chronicles|6|31|that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2 Chronicles|6|32|Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:
2 Chronicles|6|33|then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calleth to thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
2 Chronicles|6|34|If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
2 Chronicles|6|35|then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
2 Chronicles|6|36|If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto a land far off or near;
2 Chronicles|6|37|yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
2 Chronicles|6|38|if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
2 Chronicles|6|39|then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
2 Chronicles|6|40|Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles|6|41|Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
2 Chronicles|6|42|
2 Chronicles|7|1|Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
2 Chronicles|7|2|And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah’s house.
2 Chronicles|7|3|for ever.
2 Chronicles|7|4|Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|7|5|And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
2 Chronicles|7|6|for ever,) when David praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.
2 Chronicles|7|7|Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat.
2 Chronicles|7|8|So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|7|9|And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
2 Chronicles|7|10|And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away unto their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had showed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
2 Chronicles|7|11|Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
2 Chronicles|7|12|And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
2 Chronicles|7|13|If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
2 Chronicles|7|14|if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
2 Chronicles|7|15|Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent, unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles|7|16|For now have I chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
2 Chronicles|7|17|And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
2 Chronicles|7|18|then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
2 Chronicles|7|19|But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
2 Chronicles|7|20|then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
2 Chronicles|7|21|And this house, which is so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?
2 Chronicles|7|22|
2 Chronicles|8|1|And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,
2 Chronicles|8|2|that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
2 Chronicles|8|3|And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
2 Chronicles|8|4|And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.
2 Chronicles|8|5|Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
2 Chronicles|8|6|and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
2 Chronicles|8|7|As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel;
2 Chronicles|8|8|unto this day.
2 Chronicles|8|9|But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
2 Chronicles|8|10|And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
2 Chronicles|8|11|And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of Jehovah hath come.
2 Chronicles|8|12|Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,
2 Chronicles|8|13|in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
2 Chronicles|8|14|And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
2 Chronicles|8|15|And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
2 Chronicles|8|16|the house of Jehovah was completed.
2 Chronicles|8|17|Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles|8|18|
2 Chronicles|9|1|And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
2 Chronicles|9|2|And Solomon told her all her questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomon which he told her not.
2 Chronicles|9|3|And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
2 Chronicles|9|4|and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
2 Chronicles|9|5|And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|6|Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
2 Chronicles|9|7|Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|8|Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne, to be king for Jehovah thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
2 Chronicles|9|9|And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|10|And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, that brought gold from Ophir, brought algum-trees and precious stones.
2 Chronicles|9|11|And the king made of the algum-trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles|9|12|And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, besides that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
2 Chronicles|9|13|Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold,
2 Chronicles|9|14|besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|15|of beaten gold went to one buckler.
2 Chronicles|9|16|of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles|9|17|Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
2 Chronicles|9|18|nd there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
2 Chronicles|9|19|And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
2 Chronicles|9|20|And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
2 Chronicles|9|21|For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
2 Chronicles|9|22|So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2 Chronicles|9|23|And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
2 Chronicles|9|24|And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
2 Chronicles|9|25|And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|9|26|And he ruled over all the kings from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|9|27|And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
2 Chronicles|9|28|And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
2 Chronicles|9|29|Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
2 Chronicles|9|30|And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2 Chronicles|9|31|
2 Chronicles|10|1|And Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
2 Chronicles|10|2|And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon,) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles|10|3|And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spake to Rehoboam, saying,
2 Chronicles|10|4|Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
2 Chronicles|10|5|And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2 Chronicles|10|6|And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
2 Chronicles|10|7|And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
2 Chronicles|10|8|But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.
2 Chronicles|10|9|And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?
2 Chronicles|10|10|And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
2 Chronicles|10|11|with scorpions.
2 Chronicles|10|12|So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
2 Chronicles|10|13|And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
2 Chronicles|10|14|with scorpions.
2 Chronicles|10|15|So the king hearkened not unto the people; for it was brought about of God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spake by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
2 Chronicles|10|16|And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed unto their tents.
2 Chronicles|10|17|But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
2 Chronicles|10|18|Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|10|19|
2 Chronicles|11|1|And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
2 Chronicles|11|2|But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
2 Chronicles|11|3|Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
2 Chronicles|11|4|Thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house; for this thing is of me. So they hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles|11|5|And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
2 Chronicles|11|6|He built Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
2 Chronicles|11|7|And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
2 Chronicles|11|8|and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
2 Chronicles|11|9|and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
2 Chronicles|11|10|and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
2 Chronicles|11|11|And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.
2 Chronicles|11|12|shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
2 Chronicles|11|13|And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.
2 Chronicles|11|14|For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office unto Jehovah;
2 Chronicles|11|15|and he appointed him priests for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.
2 Chronicles|11|16|And after them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|11|17|So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.
2 Chronicles|11|18|Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
2 Chronicles|11|19|and she bare him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles|11|20|And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles|11|21|And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines, and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters.)
2 Chronicles|11|22|to make him king.
2 Chronicles|11|23|
2 Chronicles|12|1|And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
2 Chronicles|12|2|And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|12|3|with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen. And the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles|12|4|And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came unto Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|12|5|Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles|12|6|Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.
2 Chronicles|12|7|And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles|12|8|Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Chronicles|12|9|So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house: he took all away: he took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles|12|10|And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the door of the king’s house.
2 Chronicles|12|11|And it was so, that, as oft as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bare them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.
2 Chronicles|12|12|.
2 Chronicles|12|13|So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
2 Chronicles|12|14|And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|12|15|Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
2 Chronicles|12|16|
2 Chronicles|13|1|In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
2 Chronicles|13|2|Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles|13|3|And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|13|4|And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:
2 Chronicles|13|5|Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles|13|6|Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.
2 Chronicles|13|7|And there were gathered unto him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
2 Chronicles|13|8|And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
2 Chronicles|13|9|no gods.
2 Chronicles|13|10|priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
2 Chronicles|13|11|in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Jehovah our God; but ye have forsaken him.
2 Chronicles|13|12|And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
2 Chronicles|13|13|But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.
2 Chronicles|13|14|And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles|13|15|Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles|13|16|And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.
2 Chronicles|13|17|And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
2 Chronicles|13|18|Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|13|19|And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephron with the towns thereof.
2 Chronicles|13|20|Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah smote him, and he died.
2 Chronicles|13|21|But Abijah waxed mighty, and took unto himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles|13|22|
2 Chronicles|14|1|So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
2 Chronicles|14|2|And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God:
2 Chronicles|14|3|for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and brake down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,
2 Chronicles|14|4|and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
2 Chronicles|14|5|Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
2 Chronicles|14|6|And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.
2 Chronicles|14|7|For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
2 Chronicles|14|8|And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|14|9|And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.
2 Chronicles|14|10|Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2 Chronicles|14|11|And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
2 Chronicles|14|12|So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
2 Chronicles|14|13|And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.
2 Chronicles|14|14|And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Jehovah came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.
2 Chronicles|14|15|
2 Chronicles|15|1|And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
2 Chronicles|15|2|and he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Jehovah is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
2 Chronicles|15|3|Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law:
2 Chronicles|15|4|But when in their distress they turned unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
2 Chronicles|15|5|And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
2 Chronicles|15|6|And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.
2 Chronicles|15|7|But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.
2 Chronicles|15|8|And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|15|9|And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and them that sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
2 Chronicles|15|10|So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2 Chronicles|15|11|And they sacrificed unto Jehovah in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles|15|12|And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;
2 Chronicles|15|13|and that whosoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
2 Chronicles|15|14|And they sware unto Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
2 Chronicles|15|15|And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and Jehovah gave them rest round about.
2 Chronicles|15|16|And also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|15|17|But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
2 Chronicles|15|18|And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
2 Chronicles|15|19|
2 Chronicles|16|1|In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|16|2|Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
2 Chronicles|16|3|between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
2 Chronicles|16|4|And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles|16|5|And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.
2 Chronicles|16|6|Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
2 Chronicles|16|7|And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
2 Chronicles|16|8|Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge host, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because thou didst rely on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.
2 Chronicles|16|9|For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
2 Chronicles|16|10|Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
2 Chronicles|16|11|And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|16|12|And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.
2 Chronicles|16|13|And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles|16|14|
2 Chronicles|17|1|And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
2 Chronicles|17|2|And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
2 Chronicles|17|3|And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto the Baalim,
2 Chronicles|17|4|but sought to the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|17|5|Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
2 Chronicles|17|6|And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah: and furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
2 Chronicles|17|7|Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
2 Chronicles|17|8|and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
2 Chronicles|17|9|And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.
2 Chronicles|17|10|And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles|17|11|And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.
2 Chronicles|17|12|And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.
2 Chronicles|17|13|And he had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|17|14|And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand;
2 Chronicles|17|15|and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand;
2 Chronicles|17|16|and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
2 Chronicles|17|17|And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
2 Chronicles|17|18|and next to him Jehozabad and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for war.
2 Chronicles|17|19|
2 Chronicles|18|1|Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.
2 Chronicles|18|2|to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles|18|3|with thee in the war.
2 Chronicles|18|4|And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|18|5|Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.
2 Chronicles|18|6|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
2 Chronicles|18|7|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
2 Chronicles|18|8|Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
2 Chronicles|18|9|Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
2 Chronicles|18|10|And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
2 Chronicles|18|11|And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
2 Chronicles|18|12|good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
2 Chronicles|18|13|And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what my God saith, that will I speak.
2 Chronicles|18|14|And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.
2 Chronicles|18|15|And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
2 Chronicles|18|16|And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
2 Chronicles|18|17|And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
2 Chronicles|18|18|said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
2 Chronicles|18|19|And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
2 Chronicles|18|20|And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?
2 Chronicles|18|21|And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
2 Chronicles|18|22|Now therefore, behold, Jehovah hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah hath spoken evil concerning thee.
2 Chronicles|18|23|Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?
2 Chronicles|18|24|And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
2 Chronicles|18|25|And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
2 Chronicles|18|26|and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
2 Chronicles|18|27|And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
2 Chronicles|18|28|So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Chronicles|18|29|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.
2 Chronicles|18|30|Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|18|31|from him.
2 Chronicles|18|32|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
2 Chronicles|18|33|And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
2 Chronicles|18|34|
2 Chronicles|19|1|And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|19|2|And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate Jehovah? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|19|3|Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek God.
2 Chronicles|19|4|And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|19|5|And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
2 Chronicles|19|6|with you in the judgment.
2 Chronicles|19|7|Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
2 Chronicles|19|8|of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|19|9|And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles|19|10|And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty.
2 Chronicles|19|11|
2 Chronicles|20|1|And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
2 Chronicles|20|2|Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).
2 Chronicles|20|3|And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek unto Jehovah; and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
2 Chronicles|20|4|of Jehovah: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|5|And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court;
2 Chronicles|20|6|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and art not thou ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.
2 Chronicles|20|7|Didst not thou, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
2 Chronicles|20|8|And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,
2 Chronicles|20|9|If evil come upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, and thou wilt hear and save.
2 Chronicles|20|10|And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;
2 Chronicles|20|11|behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
2 Chronicles|20|12|O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
2 Chronicles|20|13|And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
2 Chronicles|20|14|Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly;
2 Chronicles|20|15|and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat: Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
2 Chronicles|20|16|To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles|20|17|: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: to-morrow go out against them: for Jehovah is with you.
2 Chronicles|20|18|And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshipping Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|19|And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.
2 Chronicles|20|20|And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
2 Chronicles|20|21|for ever.
2 Chronicles|20|22|And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
2 Chronicles|20|23|For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
2 Chronicles|20|24|And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.
2 Chronicles|20|25|And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
2 Chronicles|20|26|And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Jehovah: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah unto this day.
2 Chronicles|20|27|Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
2 Chronicles|20|28|And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|29|And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles|20|30|So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.
2 Chronicles|20|31|And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles|20|32|And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|20|33|Howbeit the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|20|34|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|20|35|And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel; the same did very wickedly:
2 Chronicles|20|36|and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
2 Chronicles|20|37|
2 Chronicles|21|1|And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|21|2|And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|21|3|And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he was the first-born.
2 Chronicles|21|4|Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
2 Chronicles|21|5|Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|21|6|And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|21|7|Howbeit Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children alway.
2 Chronicles|21|8|In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
2 Chronicles|21|9|Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.
2 Chronicles|21|10|So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|21|11|Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.
2 Chronicles|21|12|And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
2 Chronicles|21|13|but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like as the house of Ahab did, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself:
2 Chronicles|21|14|behold, Jehovah will smite with a great plague thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance;
2 Chronicles|21|15|and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
2 Chronicles|21|16|And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians that are beside the Ethiopians:
2 Chronicles|21|17|and they came up against Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2 Chronicles|21|18|And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
2 Chronicles|21|19|And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|21|20|
2 Chronicles|22|1|And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
2 Chronicles|22|2|Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
2 Chronicles|22|3|He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
2 Chronicles|22|4|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
2 Chronicles|22|5|He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Chronicles|22|6|And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2 Chronicles|22|7|Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went unto Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
2 Chronicles|22|8|And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.
2 Chronicles|22|9|And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
2 Chronicles|22|10|Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
2 Chronicles|22|11|But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
2 Chronicles|22|12|
2 Chronicles|23|1|And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
2 Chronicles|23|2|of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|23|3|And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the sons of David.
2 Chronicles|23|4|This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;
2 Chronicles|23|5|and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|6|But let none come into the house of Jehovah, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|7|And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever cometh into the house, let him be slain: and be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
2 Chronicles|23|8|So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath; with those that were to go out on the sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
2 Chronicles|23|9|And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God.
2 Chronicles|23|10|And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
2 Chronicles|23|11|live the king.
2 Chronicles|23|12|And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:
2 Chronicles|23|13|on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!
2 Chronicles|23|14|And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Slay her not in the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|23|15|So they made way for her; and she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house: and they slew her there.
2 Chronicles|23|16|And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah’s people.
2 Chronicles|23|17|And all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
2 Chronicles|23|18|And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.
2 Chronicles|23|19|And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah, that none that was unclean in anything should enter in.
2 Chronicles|23|20|And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they came through the upper gate unto the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
2 Chronicles|23|21|
2 Chronicles|24|1|Joash was seven years old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beer-sheba.
2 Chronicles|24|2|And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
2 Chronicles|24|3|And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles|24|4|And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|5|And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
2 Chronicles|24|6|And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
2 Chronicles|24|7|For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah did they bestow upon the Baalim.
2 Chronicles|24|8|So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|9|And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Jehovah the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles|24|10|And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
2 Chronicles|24|11|And it was so, that, at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
2 Chronicles|24|12|And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|13|So the workmen wrought, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
2 Chronicles|24|14|And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels wherewith to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
2 Chronicles|24|15|But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
2 Chronicles|24|16|And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.
2 Chronicles|24|17|Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
2 Chronicles|24|18|And they forsook the house of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
2 Chronicles|24|19|Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto Jehovah; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
2 Chronicles|24|20|And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you.
2 Chronicles|24|21|And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|24|22|Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, Jehovah look upon it, and require it.
2 Chronicles|24|23|And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
2 Chronicles|24|24|For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Jehovah delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.
2 Chronicles|24|25|And when they were departed for him (for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2 Chronicles|24|26|And these are they that conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
2 Chronicles|24|27|
2 Chronicles|25|1|Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|25|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles|25|3|Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
2 Chronicles|25|4|But he put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Chronicles|25|5|Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
2 Chronicles|25|6|He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles|25|7|, with all the children of Ephraim.
2 Chronicles|25|8|, be strong for the battle: God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
2 Chronicles|25|9|And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.
2 Chronicles|25|10|, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
2 Chronicles|25|11|And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
2 Chronicles|25|12|ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
2 Chronicles|25|13|But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
2 Chronicles|25|14|Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
2 Chronicles|25|15|Wherefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?
2 Chronicles|25|16|said unto him, Have we made thee of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
2 Chronicles|25|17|Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Chronicles|25|18|And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Chronicles|25|19|hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2 Chronicles|25|20|, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles|25|21|So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Chronicles|25|22|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Chronicles|25|23|And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Chronicles|25|24|all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|25|25|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Chronicles|25|26|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
2 Chronicles|25|27|Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Chronicles|25|28|
2 Chronicles|26|1|And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2 Chronicles|26|2|He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
2 Chronicles|26|3|Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|26|4|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles|26|5|And he set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as he sought Jehovah, God made him to prosper.
2 Chronicles|26|6|Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
2 Chronicles|26|7|And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Meunim.
2 Chronicles|26|8|And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he waxed exceeding strong.
2 Chronicles|26|9|, and fortified them.
2 Chronicles|26|10|husbandmen and vinedressers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved husbandry.
2 Chronicles|26|11|Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.
2 Chronicles|26|12|, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.
2 Chronicles|26|13|And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
2 Chronicles|26|14|And Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the host, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.
2 Chronicles|26|15|And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skilful men, to be on the towers and upon the battlements, wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.
2 Chronicles|26|16|But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Jehovah his God; for he went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|17|And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of Jehovah, that were valiant men:
2 Chronicles|26|18|and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honor from Jehovah God.
2 Chronicles|26|19|Then Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy brake forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles|26|20|And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because Jehovah had smitten him.
2 Chronicles|26|21|And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
2 Chronicles|26|22|Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.
2 Chronicles|26|23|
2 Chronicles|27|1|Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles|27|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: howbeit he entered not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people did yet corruptly.
2 Chronicles|27|3|He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
2 Chronicles|27|4|Moreover he built cities in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
2 Chronicles|27|5|He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render unto him, in the second year also, and in the third.
2 Chronicles|27|6|So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|27|7|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles|27|8|He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|27|9|
2 Chronicles|28|1|Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like David his father;
2 Chronicles|28|2|but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.
2 Chronicles|28|3|Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|4|And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2 Chronicles|28|5|Wherefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
2 Chronicles|28|6|For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|28|7|And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
2 Chronicles|28|8|And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|28|9|But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage which hath reached up to heaven.
2 Chronicles|28|10|are there not even with you trespasses of your own against Jehovah your God?
2 Chronicles|28|11|Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
2 Chronicles|28|12|Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
2 Chronicles|28|13|and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for ye purpose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add unto our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|14|So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|28|15|And the men that have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, unto their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles|28|16|At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
2 Chronicles|28|17|For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
2 Chronicles|28|18|The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns thereof, and Timnah with the towns thereof, Gimzo also and the towns thereof: and they dwelt there.
2 Chronicles|28|19|For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|28|20|And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
2 Chronicles|28|21|For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but it helped him not.
2 Chronicles|28|22|And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.
2 Chronicles|28|23|will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|24|And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|28|25|And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|28|26|Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|28|27|
2 Chronicles|29|1|Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles|29|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
2 Chronicles|29|3|He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.
2 Chronicles|29|4|And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
2 Chronicles|29|5|and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
2 Chronicles|29|6|For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.
2 Chronicles|29|7|Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|8|Wherefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
2 Chronicles|29|9|For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
2 Chronicles|29|10|Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
2 Chronicles|29|11|My sons, be not now negligent; for Jehovah hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.
2 Chronicles|29|12|Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;
2 Chronicles|29|13|and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2 Chronicles|29|14|and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2 Chronicles|29|15|And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|16|And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of Jehovah, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|29|17|of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Jehovah; and they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
2 Chronicles|29|18|, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|29|19|Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|20|Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|21|And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|22|So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
2 Chronicles|29|23|And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them:
2 Chronicles|29|24|for all Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|25|And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.
2 Chronicles|29|26|And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles|29|27|And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.
2 Chronicles|29|28|until the burnt-offering was finished.
2 Chronicles|29|29|And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
2 Chronicles|29|30|Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
2 Chronicles|29|31|burnt-offerings.
2 Chronicles|29|32|And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|29|33|And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles|29|34|But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
2 Chronicles|29|35|And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
2 Chronicles|29|36|
2 Chronicles|30|1|And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|30|2|For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles|30|3|For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|4|And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|5|So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
2 Chronicles|30|6|So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
2 Chronicles|30|7|And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
2 Chronicles|30|8|Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
2 Chronicles|30|9|For if ye turn again unto Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
2 Chronicles|30|10|So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
2 Chronicles|30|11|Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|12|Also upon Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|13|And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
2 Chronicles|30|14|And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2 Chronicles|30|15|of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|16|of the hand of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|30|17|For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|18|For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon every one
2 Chronicles|30|19|according to the purification of the sanctuary.
2 Chronicles|30|20|And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
2 Chronicles|30|21|with loud instruments unto Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|30|22|of Jehovah. So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|30|23|seven days with gladness.
2 Chronicles|30|24|For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2 Chronicles|30|25|And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
2 Chronicles|30|26|So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|30|27|
2 Chronicles|31|1|Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and brake down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
2 Chronicles|31|2|And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|3|, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|4|Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|31|5|And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
2 Chronicles|31|6|And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated unto Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|7|In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
2 Chronicles|31|8|And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|31|9|Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2 Chronicles|31|10|began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Jehovah hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.
2 Chronicles|31|11|Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah; and they prepared them.
2 Chronicles|31|12|And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second.
2 Chronicles|31|13|And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
2 Chronicles|31|14|, was over the freewill-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.
2 Chronicles|31|15|And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
2 Chronicles|31|16|besides them that were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even every one that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|17|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their courses;
2 Chronicles|31|18|and them that were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.
2 Chronicles|31|19|Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, that were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men that were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
2 Chronicles|31|20|And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|31|21|
2 Chronicles|32|1|After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
2 Chronicles|32|2|And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles|32|3|he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped him.
2 Chronicles|32|4|So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
2 Chronicles|32|5|the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
2 Chronicles|32|6|And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|7|Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him:
2 Chronicles|32|8|with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|32|9|After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was before Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
2 Chronicles|32|10|Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?
2 Chronicles|32|11|Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Chronicles|32|12|Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye burn incense?
2 Chronicles|32|13|Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|14|Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|15|Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
2 Chronicles|32|16|And his servants spake yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|17|He wrote also letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
2 Chronicles|32|18|And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
2 Chronicles|32|19|And they spake of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands.
2 Chronicles|32|20|And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
2 Chronicles|32|21|And Jehovah sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
2 Chronicles|32|22|, and guided them on every side.
2 Chronicles|32|23|And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
2 Chronicles|32|24|In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death: and he prayed unto Jehovah; and he spake unto him, and gave him a sign.
2 Chronicles|32|25|But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|32|26|Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles|32|27|And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;
2 Chronicles|32|28|store-houses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.
2 Chronicles|32|29|Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much substance.
2 Chronicles|32|30|This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
2 Chronicles|32|31|the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2 Chronicles|32|32|Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles|32|33|
2 Chronicles|33|1|Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|3|For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|4|And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
2 Chronicles|33|5|And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|33|6|He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Chronicles|33|7|And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
2 Chronicles|33|8|by Moses.
2 Chronicles|33|9|And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|10|And Jehovah spake to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.
2 Chronicles|33|11|Wherefore Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|33|12|And when he was in distress, he besought Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles|33|13|And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah he was God.
2 Chronicles|33|14|, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles|33|15|And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
2 Chronicles|33|16|And he built up the altar of Jehovah, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|17|Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto Jehovah their God.
2 Chronicles|33|18|Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles|33|19|was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
2 Chronicles|33|20|So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|33|21|Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|33|22|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
2 Chronicles|33|23|And he humbled not himself before Jehovah, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
2 Chronicles|33|24|And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
2 Chronicles|33|25|
2 Chronicles|34|1|Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|2|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Chronicles|34|3|For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.
2 Chronicles|34|4|that had sacrificed unto them.
2 Chronicles|34|5|And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|6|in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
2 Chronicles|34|7|And he brake down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|8|Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|34|9|And they came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|10|And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and the workmen that wrought in the house of Jehovah gave it to mend and repair the house;
2 Chronicles|34|11|even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2 Chronicles|34|12|the Levites, all that were skilful with instruments of music.
2 Chronicles|34|13|Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all that did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2 Chronicles|34|14|by Moses.
2 Chronicles|34|15|And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
2 Chronicles|34|16|And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they are doing.
2 Chronicles|34|17|And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
2 Chronicles|34|18|And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read therein before the king.
2 Chronicles|34|19|And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2 Chronicles|34|20|And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
2 Chronicles|34|21|Go ye, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah, to do according unto all that is written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|22|, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spake to her to that effect.
2 Chronicles|34|23|And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,
2 Chronicles|34|24|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles|34|25|Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
2 Chronicles|34|26|But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,
2 Chronicles|34|27|because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|28|Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. And they brought back word to the king.
2 Chronicles|34|29|Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|34|30|And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|34|31|And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
2 Chronicles|34|32|. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles|34|33|
2 Chronicles|35|1|of the first month.
2 Chronicles|35|2|And he set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|35|3|And he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, that were holy unto Jehovah, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden upon your shoulders: now serve Jehovah your God, and his people Israel.
2 Chronicles|35|4|And prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
2 Chronicles|35|5|a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites.
2 Chronicles|35|6|And kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of Jehovah by Moses.
2 Chronicles|35|7|And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.
2 Chronicles|35|8|, and three hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|9|, and five hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|10|So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king’s commandment.
2 Chronicles|35|11|of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
2 Chronicles|35|12|And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
2 Chronicles|35|13|And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
2 Chronicles|35|14|in offering the burnt-offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles|35|15|And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they needed not to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
2 Chronicles|35|16|So all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|17|And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
2 Chronicles|35|18|And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|35|19|In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
2 Chronicles|35|20|After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
2 Chronicles|35|21|God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
2 Chronicles|35|22|Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles|35|23|And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
2 Chronicles|35|24|So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2 Chronicles|35|25|And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations unto this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.
2 Chronicles|35|26|Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah,
2 Chronicles|35|27|
2 Chronicles|36|1|Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|2|Joahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|3|And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and fined the land a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2 Chronicles|36|4|And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles|36|5|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah his God.
2 Chronicles|36|6|Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|7|Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|8|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Chronicles|36|9|Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|10|And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|11|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
2 Chronicles|36|12|from the mouth of Jehovah.
2 Chronicles|36|13|And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles|36|14|Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles|36|15|And Jehovah, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
2 Chronicles|36|16|but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
2 Chronicles|36|17|Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, old man or hoary-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
2 Chronicles|36|18|And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.
2 Chronicles|36|19|And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
2 Chronicles|36|20|And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
2 Chronicles|36|21|as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
2 Chronicles|36|22|also in writing, saying,
2 Chronicles|36|23|
Philippians|1|1|Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
Philippians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians|1|3|I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,
Philippians|1|4|always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,
Philippians|1|5|for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;
Philippians|1|6|being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:
Philippians|1|7|even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.
Philippians|1|8|For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
Philippians|1|9|And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;
Philippians|1|10|so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;
Philippians|1|11|being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
Philippians|1|12|unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;
Philippians|1|13|so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;
Philippians|1|14|and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
Philippians|1|15|Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Philippians|1|16|of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;
Philippians|1|17|but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.
Philippians|1|18|What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
Philippians|1|19|For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians|1|20|now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
Philippians|1|21|For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
Philippians|1|22|this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.
Philippians|1|23|But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:
Philippians|1|24|yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
Philippians|1|25|And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;
Philippians|1|26|that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
Philippians|1|27|Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;
Philippians|1|28|and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;
Philippians|1|29|because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:
Philippians|1|30|
Philippians|2|1|If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,
Philippians|2|2|make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;
Philippians|2|3|nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;
Philippians|2|4|not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
Philippians|2|5|Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
Philippians|2|6|who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,
Philippians|2|7|but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;
Philippians|2|8|unto death, yea, the death of the cross.
Philippians|2|9|Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;
Philippians|2|10|under the earth,
Philippians|2|11|and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians|2|12|So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
Philippians|2|13|for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
Philippians|2|14|Do all things without murmurings and questionings:
Philippians|2|15|that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,
Philippians|2|16|holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.
Philippians|2|17|Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:
Philippians|2|18|and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.
Philippians|2|19|But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
Philippians|2|20|For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.
Philippians|2|21|For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.
Philippians|2|22|he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.
Philippians|2|23|Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:
Philippians|2|24|but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.
Philippians|2|25|But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;
Philippians|2|26|since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:
Philippians|2|27|for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians|2|28|I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Philippians|2|29|Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:
Philippians|2|30|
Philippians|3|1|Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.
Philippians|3|2|Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:
Philippians|3|3|for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:
Philippians|3|4|though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:
Philippians|3|5|circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
Philippians|3|6|as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
Philippians|3|7|Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.
Philippians|3|8|Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,
Philippians|3|9|that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:
Philippians|3|10|that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;
Philippians|3|11|if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
Philippians|3|12|Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.
Philippians|3|13|, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,
Philippians|3|14|I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|3|15|Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:
Philippians|3|16|let us walk.
Philippians|3|17|Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.
Philippians|3|18|the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Philippians|3|19|glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
Philippians|3|20|For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Philippians|3|21|
Philippians|4|1|Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.
Philippians|4|2|I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.
Philippians|4|3|Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Philippians|4|4|Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.
Philippians|4|5|Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
Philippians|4|6|In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
Philippians|4|7|And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|8|Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
Philippians|4|9|The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
Philippians|4|10|But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.
Philippians|4|11|Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.
Philippians|4|12|I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.
Philippians|4|13|I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.
Philippians|4|14|Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.
Philippians|4|15|And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;
Philippians|4|16|for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.
Philippians|4|17|Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.
Philippians|4|18|from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.
Philippians|4|19|And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|20|the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians|4|21|Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.
Philippians|4|22|All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar’s household.
Philippians|4|23|
Luke|1|1|Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
Luke|1|2|even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,
Luke|1|3|it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;
Luke|1|4|that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.
Luke|1|5|There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
Luke|1|6|And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.
Luke|1|7|well stricken in years.
Luke|1|8|Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
Luke|1|9|according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
Luke|1|10|And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
Luke|1|11|And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of altar of incense.
Luke|1|12|, and fear fell upon him.
Luke|1|13|But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
Luke|1|14|And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
Luke|1|15|For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
Luke|1|16|And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto the Lord their God.
Luke|1|17|.
Luke|1|18|And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
Luke|1|19|And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.
Luke|1|20|And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
Luke|1|21|And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.
Luke|1|22|And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.
Luke|1|23|And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.
Luke|1|24|And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,
Luke|1|25|, to take away my reproach among men.
Luke|1|26|Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
Luke|1|27|to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
Luke|1|28|with thee.
Luke|1|29|But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.
Luke|1|30|And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor with God.
Luke|1|31|And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
Luke|1|32|He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
Luke|1|33|and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
Luke|1|34|And Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
Luke|1|35|And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God.
Luke|1|36|And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.
Luke|1|37|For no word from God shall be void of power.
Luke|1|38|And Mary said, Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
Luke|1|39|And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;
Luke|1|40|and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.
Luke|1|41|And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;
Luke|1|42|the fruit of thy womb.
Luke|1|43|And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me?
Luke|1|44|For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
Luke|1|45|she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.

Luke|1|55|
Luke|1|56|And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.
Luke|1|57|Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
Luke|1|58|And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
Luke|1|59|And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.
Luke|1|60|And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
Luke|1|61|And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
Luke|1|62|And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
Luke|1|63|And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
Luke|1|64|, and he spake, blessing God.
Luke|1|65|And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
Luke|1|66|And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.

Luke|2|1|Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.
Luke|2|2|This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
Luke|2|3|And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.
Luke|2|4|And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David;
Luke|2|5|to enrol himself with Mary, who was betrothed to him, being great with child.
Luke|2|6|And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.
Luke|2|7|And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Luke|2|8|And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
Luke|2|9|And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
Luke|2|10|And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people:
Luke|2|11|for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
Luke|2|12|the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.
Luke|2|13|
Luke|2|14|
Luke|2|15|And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.
Luke|2|16|And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
Luke|2|17|And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
Luke|2|18|And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.
Luke|2|19|But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
Luke|2|20|And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.
Luke|2|21|And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called JESUS, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Luke|2|22|And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord
Luke|2|23|(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),
Luke|2|24|and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
Luke|2|25|And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke|2|26|And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke|2|27|And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,
Luke|2|28|
Luke|2|29|
Luke|2|30|
Luke|2|31|
Luke|2|32|
Luke|2|33|And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him;
Luke|2|34|is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;
Luke|2|35|yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.
Luke|2|36|And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
Luke|2|37|and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.
Luke|2|38|And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God, and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
Luke|2|39|And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
Luke|2|40|And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
Luke|2|41|And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
Luke|2|42|And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;
Luke|2|43|and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not;
Luke|2|44|but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance:
Luke|2|45|and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.
Luke|2|46|And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:
Luke|2|47|and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
Luke|2|48|And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.
Luke|2|49|And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house?
Luke|2|50|And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
Luke|2|51|sayings in her heart.
Luke|2|52|
Luke|3|1|Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke|3|2|in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
Luke|3|3|And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins;
Luke|3|4|as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.
Luke|3|5|Every valley shall be filled, And every mountain and hill shall be brought low; And the crooked shall become straight, And the rough ways smooth;
Luke|3|6|And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Luke|3|7|He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Luke|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Luke|3|9|And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Luke|3|10|And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do?
Luke|3|11|And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.
Luke|3|12|And there came also publicans to be baptized, and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do?
Luke|3|13|And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.
Luke|3|14|wrongfully; and be content with your wages.
Luke|3|15|And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether haply he were the Christ;
Luke|3|16|fire:
Luke|3|17|whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Luke|3|18|With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people;
Luke|3|19|but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,
Luke|3|20|added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
Luke|3|21|Now it came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that, Jesus also having been baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
Luke|3|22|and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

Luke|4|1|And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness
Luke|4|2|during forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he did eat nothing in those days: and when they were completed, he hungered.
Luke|4|3|And the devil said unto him, if thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it become bread.
Luke|4|4|And Jesus answered unto him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.
Luke|4|5|And he led him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
Luke|4|6|And the devil said unto him, To thee will I give all this authority, and the glory of them: for it hath been delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.
Luke|4|7|If thou therefore wilt worship before me, it shall all be thine.
Luke|4|8|And Jesus answered and said unto him, It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Luke|4|9|And he led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:
Luke|4|10|
Luke|4|11|
Luke|4|12|
Luke|4|13|
Luke|4|14|And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about.
Luke|4|15|
Luke|4|16|And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and he entered, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read.
Luke|4|17|
Luke|4|18|
Luke|4|19|
Luke|4|20|And he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down: and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.
Luke|4|21|And he began to say unto them, To-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears.
Luke|4|22|And all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth: and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
Luke|4|23|And he said unto them, Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in thine own country.
Luke|4|24|And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is acceptable in his own country.
Luke|4|25|But of a truth I say unto you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there came a great famine over all the land;
Luke|4|26|and unto none of them was Elijah sent, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.
Luke|4|27|And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.
Luke|4|28|And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things;
Luke|4|29|and they rose up, and cast him forth out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.
Luke|4|30|But he passing through the midst of them went his way.
Luke|4|31|And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath day:
Luke|4|32|and they were astonished at his teaching; for his word was with authority.
Luke|4|33|And in the synagogue there was a man, that had a spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke|4|34|Ah! what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Luke|4|35|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.
Luke|4|36|And amazement came upon all, and they spake together, one with another, saying, What is this word? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
Luke|4|37|And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about.
Luke|4|38|And he rose up from the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s wife’s mother was holden with a great fever; and they besought him for her.
Luke|4|39|And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them.
Luke|4|40|And when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.
Luke|4|41|And demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.
Luke|4|42|And when it was day, he came out and went into a desert place: and the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.
Luke|4|43|But he said unto them, I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also: for therefore was I sent.
Luke|4|44|
Luke|5|1|Now it came to pass, while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God, that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
Luke|5|2|and he saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
Luke|5|3|And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.
Luke|5|4|And when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
Luke|5|5|And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at thy word I will let down the nets.
Luke|5|6|And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking;
Luke|5|7|and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke|5|8|But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
Luke|5|9|For he was amazed, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken;
Luke|5|10|and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
Luke|5|11|And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.
Luke|5|12|And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Luke|5|13|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway the leprosy departed from him.
Luke|5|14|And he charged him to tell no man: but go thy way, and show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Luke|5|15|But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.
Luke|5|16|But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.
Luke|5|17|And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was with him to heal.
Luke|5|18|And behold, men bring on a bed a man that was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
Luke|5|19|they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
Luke|5|20|And seeing their faith, he said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
Luke|5|21|And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
Luke|5|22|But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said unto them, Why reason ye in your hearts?
Luke|5|23|Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
Luke|5|24|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he said unto him that was palsied), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go unto thy house.
Luke|5|25|And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.
Luke|5|26|And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to-day.
Luke|5|27|And after these things he went forth, and beheld a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said unto him, Follow me.
Luke|5|28|And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.
Luke|5|29|And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them.
Luke|5|30|And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?
Luke|5|31|And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are in health have no need of a physician; but they that are sick.
Luke|5|32|I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
Luke|5|33|of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink.
Luke|5|34|And Jesus said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?
Luke|5|35|But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then will they fast in those days.
Luke|5|36|And he spake also a parable unto them: No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment; else he will rend the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.
Luke|5|37|And no man putteth new wine into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.
Luke|5|38|But new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins.
Luke|5|39|
Luke|6|1|Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
Luke|6|2|But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day?
Luke|6|3|And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him;
Luke|6|4|how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone?
Luke|6|5|And he said unto them, The Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
Luke|6|6|And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
Luke|6|7|And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.
Luke|6|8|But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
Luke|6|9|And Jesus said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?
Luke|6|10|: and his hand was restored.
Luke|6|11|But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke|6|12|And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.
Luke|6|13|And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:
Luke|6|14|Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
Luke|6|15|of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,
Luke|6|16|of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;
Luke|6|17|and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
Luke|6|18|and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
Luke|6|19|all.
Luke|6|20|ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke|6|21|ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke|6|22|, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.
Luke|6|23|: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
Luke|6|24|But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Luke|6|25|, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke|6|26|, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.
Luke|6|27|But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,
Luke|6|28|bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.
Luke|6|29|cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.
Luke|6|30|Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
Luke|6|31|And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
Luke|6|32|And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.
Luke|6|33|And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.
Luke|6|34|And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.
Luke|6|35|good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
Luke|6|36|Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
Luke|6|37|And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released:
Luke|6|38|give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.
Luke|6|39|And he spake also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit?
Luke|6|40|The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.
Luke|6|41|And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Luke|6|42|Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
Luke|6|43|For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.
Luke|6|44|For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
Luke|6|45|bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke|6|46|And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
Luke|6|47|Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like:
Luke|6|48|he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.
Luke|6|49|
Luke|7|1|After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
Luke|7|2|And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.
Luke|7|3|And when he heard concerning Jesus, he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.
Luke|7|4|And they, when they came to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him;
Luke|7|5|for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.
Luke|7|6|And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof:
Luke|7|7|wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Luke|7|8|For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Luke|7|9|And when Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Luke|7|10|And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
Luke|7|11|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.
Luke|7|12|Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
Luke|7|13|And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
Luke|7|14|And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
Luke|7|15|And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
Luke|7|16|And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, God hath visited his people.
Luke|7|17|And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about.
Luke|7|18|And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
Luke|7|19|And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|20|And when the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Luke|7|21|In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.
Luke|7|22|And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Luke|7|23|And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
Luke|7|24|And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Luke|7|25|But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
Luke|7|26|But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke|7|27|
Luke|7|28|I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Luke|7|29|And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke|7|30|But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, being not baptized of him.
Luke|7|31|Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?
Luke|7|32|They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.
Luke|7|33|For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
Luke|7|34|The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
Luke|7|35|And wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke|7|36|And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
Luke|7|37|And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment,
Luke|7|38|and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke|7|39|Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
Luke|7|40|And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Teacher, say on.
Luke|7|41|A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.
Luke|7|42|to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?
Luke|7|43|Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
Luke|7|44|And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
Luke|7|45|Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke|7|46|My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke|7|47|loveth little.
Luke|7|48|And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
Luke|7|49|And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins?
Luke|7|50|
Luke|8|1|And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God, and with him the twelve,
Luke|8|2|and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary that was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke|8|3|and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.
Luke|8|4|And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:
Luke|8|5|The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.
Luke|8|6|And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
Luke|8|7|And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
Luke|8|8|And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|8|9|And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.
Luke|8|10|And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
Luke|8|11|Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke|8|12|And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
Luke|8|13|they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
Luke|8|14|life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
Luke|8|15|And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.
Luke|8|16|And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.
Luke|8|17|secret, that shall not be known and come to light.
Luke|8|18|Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.
Luke|8|19|And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.
Luke|8|20|And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
Luke|8|21|But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.
Luke|8|22|Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.
Luke|8|23|, and were in jeopardy.
Luke|8|24|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke|8|25|And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?
Luke|8|26|And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.
Luke|8|27|house, but in the tombs.
Luke|8|28|And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.
Luke|8|29|For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.
Luke|8|30|And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.
Luke|8|31|And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.
Luke|8|32|Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.
Luke|8|33|And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.
Luke|8|34|And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
Luke|8|35|And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.
Luke|8|36|And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.
Luke|8|37|And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them, for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.
Luke|8|38|But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,
Luke|8|39|Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.
Luke|8|40|And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.
Luke|8|41|And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;
Luke|8|42|for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.
Luke|8|43|And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,
Luke|8|44|came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.
Luke|8|45|.
Luke|8|46|But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.
Luke|8|47|And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
Luke|8|48|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
Luke|8|49|, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
Luke|8|50|But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.
Luke|8|51|And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.
Luke|8|52|And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.
Luke|8|53|And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
Luke|8|54|But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.
Luke|8|55|be given her to eat.
Luke|8|56|
Luke|9|1|And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
Luke|9|2|And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
Luke|9|3|And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.
Luke|9|4|And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.
Luke|9|5|And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luke|9|6|And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.
Luke|9|7|Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;
Luke|9|8|and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
Luke|9|9|And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
Luke|9|10|And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.
Luke|9|11|But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.
Luke|9|12|And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
Luke|9|13|But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.
Luke|9|14|For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
Luke|9|15|And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Luke|9|16|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
Luke|9|17|And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
Luke|9|18|And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
Luke|9|19|, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
Luke|9|20|And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
Luke|9|21|to tell this to no man;
Luke|9|22|saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Luke|9|23|And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
Luke|9|24|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
Luke|9|25|For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
Luke|9|26|of the Father, and of the holy angels.
Luke|9|27|But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|28|And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
Luke|9|29|dazzling.
Luke|9|30|And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;
Luke|9|31|who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Luke|9|32|Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
Luke|9|33|And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
Luke|9|34|And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
Luke|9|35|And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.
Luke|9|36|And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
Luke|9|37|And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
Luke|9|38|And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:
Luke|9|39|and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.
Luke|9|40|And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
Luke|9|41|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.
Luke|9|42|grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
Luke|9|43|And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,
Luke|9|44|Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.
Luke|9|45|But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
Luke|9|46|And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
Luke|9|47|But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
Luke|9|48|and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
Luke|9|49|And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.
Luke|9|50|not: for he that is not against you is for you.
Luke|9|51|And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luke|9|52|and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luke|9|53|going to Jerusalem.
Luke|9|54|, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?
Luke|9|55|But he turned, and rebuked them.
Luke|9|56|And they went to another village.
Luke|9|57|And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Luke|9|58|nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Luke|9|59|And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Luke|9|60|But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|61|And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.
Luke|9|62|
Luke|10|1|Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.
Luke|10|2|And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
Luke|10|3|Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Luke|10|4|Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.
Luke|10|5|to this house.
Luke|10|6|And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.
Luke|10|7|And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
Luke|10|8|And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:
Luke|10|9|and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
Luke|10|10|But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,
Luke|10|11|Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.
Luke|10|12|I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Luke|10|13|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke|10|14|But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
Luke|10|15|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.
Luke|10|16|He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
Luke|10|17|And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.
Luke|10|18|And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.
Luke|10|19|Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.
Luke|10|20|Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
Luke|10|21|In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Luke|10|22|.
Luke|10|23|the eyes which see the things that ye see:
Luke|10|24|for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Luke|10|25|And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|10|26|And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?
Luke|10|27|And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
Luke|10|28|And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
Luke|10|29|But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Luke|10|30|Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
Luke|10|31|And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|32|And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
Luke|10|33|But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,
Luke|10|34|oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
Luke|10|35|And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.
Luke|10|36|Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?
Luke|10|37|And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
Luke|10|38|Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
Luke|10|39|And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.
Luke|10|40|But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
Luke|10|41|But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:
Luke|10|42|
Luke|11|1|And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
Luke|11|2|And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Luke|11|3|Give us day by day our daily bread.
Luke|11|4|And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.
Luke|11|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
Luke|11|6|for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;
Luke|11|7|and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?
Luke|11|8|I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.
Luke|11|9|And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
Luke|11|10|For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Luke|11|11|And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?
Luke|11|12|he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
Luke|11|13|heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
Luke|11|14|dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.
Luke|11|15|But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
Luke|11|16|, sought of him a sign from heaven.
Luke|11|17|against a house falleth.
Luke|11|18|And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
Luke|11|19|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Luke|11|20|But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Luke|11|21|fully armed guardeth his own court, his goods are in peace:
Luke|11|22|but when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
Luke|11|23|He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Luke|11|24|The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and finding none, he saith, I will turn back unto my house whence I came out.
Luke|11|25|And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.
Luke|11|26|seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
Luke|11|27|And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.
Luke|11|28|But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.
Luke|11|29|And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah.
Luke|11|30|For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
Luke|11|31|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Luke|11|32|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Luke|11|33|No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, putteth it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the stand, that they which enter in may see the light.
Luke|11|34|The lamp of thy body is thine eye: when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
Luke|11|35|Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness.
Luke|11|36|If therefore thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, it shall be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light.
Luke|11|37|Now as he spake, a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
Luke|11|38|And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.
Luke|11|39|And the Lord said unto him, Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
Luke|11|40|Ye foolish ones, did not he that made the outside make the inside also?
Luke|11|41|But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, all things are clean unto you.
Luke|11|42|But woe unto you Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Luke|11|43|Woe unto you Pharisees! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.
Luke|11|44|know it not.
Luke|11|45|And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him, Teacher, in saying this thou reproachest us also.
Luke|11|46|And he said, Woe unto you lawyers also! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke|11|47|Woe unto you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luke|11|48|.
Luke|11|49|of them they shall kill and persecute;
Luke|11|50|that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
Luke|11|51|from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yea, I say unto you, it shall be required of this generation.
Luke|11|52|Woe unto you lawyers! for ye took away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
Luke|11|53|vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;
Luke|11|54|
Luke|12|1|In the mean time, when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together, insomuch that they trod one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke|12|2|But there is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Luke|12|3|Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
Luke|12|4|And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
Luke|12|5|But I will warn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Luke|12|6|Are not five sparrows sold for two pence? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.
Luke|12|7|But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke|12|8|And I say unto you, Every one who shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
Luke|12|9|but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
Luke|12|10|And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven.
Luke|12|11|And when they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, be not anxious how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:
Luke|12|12|for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.
Luke|12|13|And one out of the multitude said unto him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.
Luke|12|14|But he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
Luke|12|15|And he said unto them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
Luke|12|16|And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:
Luke|12|17|and he reasoned within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have not where to bestow my fruits?
Luke|12|18|And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods.
Luke|12|19|And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry.
Luke|12|20|But God said unto him, Thou foolish one, this night is thy soul required of thee; and the things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?
Luke|12|21|So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
Luke|12|22|life, what ye shall eat; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.
Luke|12|23|For the life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.
Luke|12|24|Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them: of how much more value are ye than the birds!
Luke|12|25|And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life?
Luke|12|26|If then ye are not able to do even that which is least, why are ye anxious concerning the rest?
Luke|12|27|Consider the lilies, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Luke|12|28|you, O ye of little faith?
Luke|12|29|And seek not ye what ye shall eat, and what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
Luke|12|30|For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke|12|31|Yet seek ye his kingdom, and these things shall be added unto you.
Luke|12|32|Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
Luke|12|33|Sell that which ye have, and give alms; make for yourselves purses which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief draweth near, neither moth destroyeth.
Luke|12|34|For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Luke|12|35|Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning;
Luke|12|36|and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord, when he shall return from the marriage feast; that, when he cometh and knocketh, they may straightway open unto him.
Luke|12|37|Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and shall come and serve them.
Luke|12|38|.
Luke|12|39|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not have left his house to be broken through.
Luke|12|40|Be ye also ready: for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Luke|12|41|And Peter said, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even unto all?
Luke|12|42|And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?
Luke|12|43|Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Luke|12|44|Of a truth I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
Luke|12|45|But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
Luke|12|46|the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.
Luke|12|47|;
Luke|12|48|. And to whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him will they ask the more.
Luke|12|49|I came to cast fire upon the earth; and what do I desire, if it is already kindled?
Luke|12|50|But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke|12|51|Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:
Luke|12|52|for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
Luke|12|53|They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.
Luke|12|54|And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|55|a south wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass.
Luke|12|56|Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?
Luke|12|57|And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
Luke|12|58|For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison.
Luke|12|59|
Luke|13|1|Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
Luke|13|2|And he answered and said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they have suffered these things?
Luke|13|3|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all in like manner perish.
Luke|13|4|Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem?
Luke|13|5|I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Luke|13|6|And he spake this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit thereon, and found none.
Luke|13|7|And he said unto the vinedresser, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why doth it also cumber the ground?
Luke|13|8|And he answering saith unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:
Luke|13|9|; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.
Luke|13|10|And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day.
Luke|13|11|And behold, a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bowed together, and could in no wise lift herself up.
Luke|13|12|And when Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
Luke|13|13|And he laid his hands upon her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
Luke|13|14|And the ruler of the synagogue, being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, answered and said to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.
Luke|13|15|But the Lord answered him, and said, Ye hypocrites, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?
Luke|13|16|eighteen years, to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath?
Luke|13|17|And as he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame: and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
Luke|13|18|He said therefore, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I liken it?
Luke|13|19|It is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof.
Luke|13|20|And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke|13|21|It is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
Luke|13|22|And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on unto Jerusalem.
Luke|13|23|And one said unto him, Lord, are they few that are saved? And he said unto them,
Luke|13|24|Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
Luke|13|25|When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are;
Luke|13|26|then shall ye begin to say, We did eat and drink in thy presence, and thou didst teach in our streets;
Luke|13|27|and he shall say, I tell you, I know not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
Luke|13|28|There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without.
Luke|13|29|And they shall come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.
Luke|13|30|And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.
Luke|13|31|In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee.
Luke|13|32|I am perfected.
Luke|13|33|following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
Luke|13|34|her own brood under her wings, and ye would not!
Luke|13|35|
Luke|14|1|And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.
Luke|14|2|And behold, there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy.
Luke|14|3|And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath, or not?
Luke|14|4|But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.
Luke|14|5|And he said unto them, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well, and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day?
Luke|14|6|And they could not answer again unto these things.
Luke|14|7|And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying unto them,
Luke|14|8|When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast, sit not down in the chief seat; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him,
Luke|14|9|and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee, Give this man place; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place.
Luke|14|10|But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee.
Luke|14|11|For everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke|14|12|And he said to him also that had bidden him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest haply they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee.
Luke|14|13|But when thou makest a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
Luke|14|14|to recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.
Luke|14|15|And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke|14|16|But he said unto him, A certain man made a great supper; and he bade many:
Luke|14|17|things are now ready.
Luke|14|18|began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out and see it; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|19|And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.
Luke|14|20|And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
Luke|14|21|And the servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame.
Luke|14|22|And the servant said, Lord, what thou didst command is done, and yet there is room.
Luke|14|23|to come in, that my house may be filled.
Luke|14|24|For I say unto you, that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper.
Luke|14|25|Now there went with him great multitudes: and he turned, and said unto them,
Luke|14|26|If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|27|Whosoever doth not bear his own cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|28|to complete it?
Luke|14|29|Lest haply, when he hath laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all that behold begin to mock him,
Luke|14|30|saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
Luke|14|31|Or what king, as he goeth to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?
Luke|14|32|Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and asketh conditions of peace.
Luke|14|33|So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
Luke|14|34|Salt therefore is good: but if even the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
Luke|14|35|
Luke|15|1|Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.
Luke|15|2|And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
Luke|15|3|And he spake unto them this parable, saying,
Luke|15|4|What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
Luke|15|5|And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Luke|15|6|And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
Luke|15|7|than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.
Luke|15|8|Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?
Luke|15|9|And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.
Luke|15|10|Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
Luke|15|11|And he said, A certain man had two sons:
Luke|15|12|substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.
Luke|15|13|And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.
Luke|15|14|And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
Luke|15|15|And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke|15|16|And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke|15|17|But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!
Luke|15|18|I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight:
Luke|15|19|I am no more worthy to be called your son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
Luke|15|20|And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
Luke|15|21|And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
Luke|15|22|But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
Luke|15|23|kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:
Luke|15|24|for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
Luke|15|25|Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
Luke|15|26|And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.
Luke|15|27|And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
Luke|15|28|But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.
Luke|15|29|thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
Luke|15|30|but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.
Luke|15|31|And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.
Luke|15|32|
Luke|16|1|And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.
Luke|16|2|And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.
Luke|16|3|And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
Luke|16|4|I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
Luke|16|5|And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
Luke|16|6|And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.
Luke|16|7|Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.
Luke|16|8|And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.
Luke|16|9|And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
Luke|16|10|He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.
Luke|16|11|?
Luke|16|12|And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?
Luke|16|13|No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Luke|16|14|And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.
Luke|16|15|And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
Luke|16|16|until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.
Luke|16|17|But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.
Luke|16|18|Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.
Luke|16|19|Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:
Luke|16|20|and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,
Luke|16|21|that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs come and licked his sores.
Luke|16|22|And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.
Luke|16|23|And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke|16|24|And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.
Luke|16|25|But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish.
Luke|16|26|And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.
Luke|16|27|And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house;
Luke|16|28|for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
Luke|16|29|But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
Luke|16|30|And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.
Luke|16|31|
Luke|17|1|And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come!
Luke|17|2|It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Luke|17|3|Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
Luke|17|4|And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
Luke|17|5|And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
Luke|17|6|And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
Luke|17|7|But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat;
Luke|17|8|and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
Luke|17|9|Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded?
Luke|17|10|Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
Luke|17|11|And it came to pass, as they were on their way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
Luke|17|12|And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:
Luke|17|13|and they lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
Luke|17|14|And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.
Luke|17|15|And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;
Luke|17|16|and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
Luke|17|17|And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
Luke|17|18|Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?
Luke|17|19|And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
Luke|17|20|And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
Luke|17|21|neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of God is within you.
Luke|17|22|And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.
Luke|17|23|:
Luke|17|24|for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Son of man be in his day.
Luke|17|25|But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
Luke|17|26|And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
Luke|17|27|They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
Luke|17|28|Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
Luke|17|29|but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:
Luke|17|30|after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.
Luke|17|31|In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.
Luke|17|32|Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke|17|33|shall preserve it.
Luke|17|34|I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
Luke|17|35|There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
Luke|17|36|
Luke|17|37|
Luke|18|1|And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;
Luke|18|2|saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man:
Luke|18|3|and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
Luke|18|4|And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
Luke|18|5|yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.
Luke|18|6|And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.
Luke|18|7|he is longsuffering over them?
Luke|18|8|I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
Luke|18|9|And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:
Luke|18|10|Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
Luke|18|11|The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
Luke|18|12|I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.
Luke|18|13|But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God, be thou merciful to me a sinner.
Luke|18|14|I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke|18|15|And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
Luke|18|16|But Jesus called them unto him, saying, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|17|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
Luke|18|18|And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|18|19|God.
Luke|18|20|Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.
Luke|18|21|And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.
Luke|18|22|And when Jesus heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Luke|18|23|But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.
Luke|18|24|And Jesus seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Luke|18|25|For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|26|And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved?
Luke|18|27|But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
Luke|18|28|And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.
Luke|18|29|And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,
Luke|18|30|who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.
Luke|18|31|And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man.
Luke|18|32|For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon:
Luke|18|33|and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Luke|18|34|And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.
Luke|18|35|And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
Luke|18|36|and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.
Luke|18|37|And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
Luke|18|38|And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke|18|39|And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Luke|18|40|And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
Luke|18|41|What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
Luke|18|42|And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight; thy faith hath made thee whole.
Luke|18|43|
Luke|19|1|And he entered and was passing through Jericho.
Luke|19|2|And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.
Luke|19|3|And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.
Luke|19|4|And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.
Luke|19|5|And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.
Luke|19|6|And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
Luke|19|7|And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.
Luke|19|8|And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.
Luke|19|9|And Jesus said unto him, To-day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
Luke|19|10|For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke|19|11|they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.
Luke|19|12|He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
Luke|19|13|till I come.
Luke|19|14|But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassage after him, saying, We will not that this man reign over us.
Luke|19|15|And it came to pass, when he was come back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants, unto whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.
Luke|19|16|And the first came before him, saying, Lord, thy pound hath made ten pounds more.
Luke|19|17|And he said unto him, Well done, thou good servant: because thou wast found faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.
Luke|19|18|And the second came, saying, Thy pound, Lord, hath made five pounds.
Luke|19|19|And he said unto him also, Be thou also over five cities.
Luke|19|20|thy pound, which I kept laid up in a napkin:
Luke|19|21|for I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou layedst not down, and reapest that which thou didst not sow.
Luke|19|22|He saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up that which I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow;
Luke|19|23|then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have required it with interest?
Luke|19|24|And he said unto them that stood by, Take away from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.
Luke|19|25|And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
Luke|19|26|I say unto you, that unto every one that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him.
Luke|19|27|But these mine enemies, that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
Luke|19|28|And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke|19|29|And it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
Luke|19|30|; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat: loose him, and bring him.
Luke|19|31|And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke|19|32|And they that were sent went away, and found even as he had said unto them.
Luke|19|33|And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
Luke|19|34|And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
Luke|19|35|And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus thereon.
Luke|19|36|And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
Luke|19|37|at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;
Luke|19|38|the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
Luke|19|39|And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.
Luke|19|40|And he answered and said, I tell you that, if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
Luke|19|41|And when he drew nigh, he saw the city and wept over it,
Luke|19|42|saying, If thou hadst known in this day, even thou, the things which belong unto peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
Luke|19|43|For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,
Luke|19|44|and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
Luke|19|45|And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,
Luke|19|46|saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.
Luke|19|47|And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:
Luke|19|48|
Luke|20|1|And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;
Luke|20|2|and they spake, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
Luke|20|3|And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me:
Luke|20|4|The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?
Luke|20|5|And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him?
Luke|20|6|But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
Luke|20|7|.
Luke|20|8|And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Luke|20|9|And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.
Luke|20|10|And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
Luke|20|11|And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
Luke|20|12|And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.
Luke|20|13|And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.
Luke|20|14|But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
Luke|20|15|And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
Luke|20|16|He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
Luke|20|17|
Luke|20|18|Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Luke|20|19|And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spake this parable against them.
Luke|20|20|And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
Luke|20|21|, but of a truth teachest the way of God:
Luke|20|22|Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Luke|20|23|But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them,
Luke|20|24|Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.
Luke|20|25|And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.
Luke|20|26|And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
Luke|20|27|And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection;
Luke|20|28|and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Luke|20|29|There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless;
Luke|20|30|and the second:
Luke|20|31|and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
Luke|20|32|Afterward the woman also died.
Luke|20|33|In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
Luke|20|34|And Jesus said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage:
Luke|20|35|but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
Luke|20|36|for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
Luke|20|37|the Bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
Luke|20|38|Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
Luke|20|39|And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
Luke|20|40|For they durst not any more ask him any question.
Luke|20|41|And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David’s son?
Luke|20|42|
Luke|20|43|
Luke|20|44|David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?
Luke|20|45|And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,
Luke|20|46|Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;
Luke|20|47|
Luke|21|1|And he looked up, and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke|21|2|And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
Luke|21|3|And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than they all:
Luke|21|4|for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had.
Luke|21|5|And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings, he said,
Luke|21|6|As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Luke|21|7|the sign when these things are about to come to pass?
Luke|21|8|; and, The time is at hand: go ye not after them.
Luke|21|9|And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these things must needs come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.
Luke|21|10|Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
Luke|21|11|and there shall be great earthquakes, and in divers places famines and pestilences; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven.
Luke|21|12|But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you, and shall persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|13|It shall turn out unto you for a testimony.
Luke|21|14|Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer:
Luke|21|15|for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay.
Luke|21|16|of you shall they cause to be put to death.
Luke|21|17|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
Luke|21|18|And not a hair of your head shall perish.
Luke|21|19|In your patience ye shall win your souls.
Luke|21|20|But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.
Luke|21|21|Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out; and let not them that are in the country enter therein.
Luke|21|22|For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
Luke|21|23|Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress upon the land, and wrath unto this people.
Luke|21|24|And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
Luke|21|25|And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows;
Luke|21|26|men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
Luke|21|27|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke|21|28|But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads; because your redemption draweth nigh.
Luke|21|29|And he spake to them a parable: Behold the fig tree, and all the trees:
Luke|21|30|when they now shoot forth, ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh.
Luke|21|31|Even so ye also, when ye see these things coming to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh.
Luke|21|32|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all things be accomplished.
Luke|21|33|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Luke|21|34|But take heed to yourselves, lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come on you suddenly as a snare:
Luke|21|35|shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth.
Luke|21|36|But watch ye at every season, making supplication, that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
Luke|21|37|And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet.
Luke|21|38|
Luke|22|1|Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
Luke|22|2|And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.
Luke|22|3|And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
Luke|22|4|And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them.
Luke|22|5|And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
Luke|22|6|And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Luke|22|7|And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed.
Luke|22|8|And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat.
Luke|22|9|And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready?
Luke|22|10|And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.
Luke|22|11|And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Luke|22|12|And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
Luke|22|13|And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Luke|22|14|And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.
Luke|22|15|And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
Luke|22|16|for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke|22|17|And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:
Luke|22|18|for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
Luke|22|19|And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Luke|22|20|that which is poured out for you.
Luke|22|21|But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
Luke|22|22|For the Son of man indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed!
Luke|22|23|And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
Luke|22|24|And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.
Luke|22|25|And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.
Luke|22|26|so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
Luke|22|27|For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
Luke|22|28|But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations;
Luke|22|29|and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me,
Luke|22|30|that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke|22|31|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:
Luke|22|32|but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.
Luke|22|33|And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.
Luke|22|34|And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
Luke|22|35|And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.
Luke|22|36|And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
Luke|22|37|For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.
Luke|22|38|And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
Luke|22|39|And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.
Luke|22|40|And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|41|And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,
Luke|22|42|saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
Luke|22|43|And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
Luke|22|44|And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
Luke|22|45|And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,
Luke|22|46|and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|47|While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
Luke|22|48|But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
Luke|22|49|And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
Luke|22|50|And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.
Luke|22|51|thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Luke|22|52|And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?
Luke|22|53|When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
Luke|22|54|, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.
Luke|22|55|And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.
Luke|22|56|, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.
Luke|22|57|But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.
Luke|22|58|of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.
Luke|22|59|And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.
Luke|22|60|But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
Luke|22|61|And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.
Luke|22|62|And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke|22|63|mocked him, and beat him.
Luke|22|64|And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?
Luke|22|65|And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.
Luke|22|66|And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,
Luke|22|67|If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
Luke|22|68|, ye will not answer.
Luke|22|69|But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Luke|22|70|And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
Luke|22|71|
Luke|23|1|And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.
Luke|23|2|And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.
Luke|23|3|And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.
Luke|23|4|And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.
Luke|23|5|But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.
Luke|23|6|But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
Luke|23|7|And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.
Luke|23|8|Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
Luke|23|9|And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke|23|10|And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Luke|23|11|And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.
Luke|23|12|And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
Luke|23|13|And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke|23|14|and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
Luke|23|15|no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.
Luke|23|16|I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
Luke|23|17|
Luke|23|18|But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --
Luke|23|19|one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
Luke|23|20|And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;
Luke|23|21|but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
Luke|23|22|And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.
Luke|23|23|But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
Luke|23|24|And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.
Luke|23|25|And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
Luke|23|26|And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.
Luke|23|27|And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
Luke|23|28|But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
Luke|23|29|For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
Luke|23|30|Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke|23|31|For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
Luke|23|32|And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
Luke|23|33|And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
Luke|23|34|And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.
Luke|23|35|And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.
Luke|23|36|And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,
Luke|23|37|and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke|23|38|And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke|23|39|And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.
Luke|23|40|But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke|23|41|And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke|23|42|And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.
Luke|23|43|And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
Luke|23|44|And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
Luke|23|45|the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke|23|46|And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.
Luke|23|47|And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
Luke|23|48|And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.
Luke|23|49|And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
Luke|23|50|And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man
Luke|23|51|of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:
Luke|23|52|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke|23|53|And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.
Luke|23|54|And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke|23|55|And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.
Luke|23|56|
Luke|24|1|But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Luke|24|2|And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
Luke|24|3|And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke|24|4|And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:
Luke|24|5|and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
Luke|24|6|He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Luke|24|7|saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
Luke|24|8|And they remembered his words,
Luke|24|9|and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
Luke|24|10|of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.
Luke|24|11|And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.
Luke|24|12|But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.
Luke|24|13|And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|14|And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.
Luke|24|15|And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
Luke|24|16|But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
Luke|24|17|And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke|24|18|And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?
Luke|24|19|And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
Luke|24|20|and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
Luke|24|21|But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.
Luke|24|22|Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;
Luke|24|23|and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
Luke|24|24|And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
Luke|24|25|And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
Luke|24|26|Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?
Luke|24|27|And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
Luke|24|28|And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.
Luke|24|29|And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.
Luke|24|30|he gave to them.
Luke|24|31|And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
Luke|24|32|And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?
Luke|24|33|And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
Luke|24|34|saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
Luke|24|35|in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke|24|36|unto you.
Luke|24|37|But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.
Luke|24|38|And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?
Luke|24|39|See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.
Luke|24|40|And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
Luke|24|41|And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?
Luke|24|42|And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.
Luke|24|43|And he took it, and ate before them.
Luke|24|44|And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.
Luke|24|45|Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;
Luke|24|46|and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;
Luke|24|47|and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|48|Ye are witnesses of these things.
Luke|24|49|And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.
Luke|24|50|over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
Luke|24|51|And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.
Luke|24|52|And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
Luke|24|53|
Malachi|1|1|The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.
Malachi|1|2|I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;
Malachi|1|3|his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
Malachi|1|4|Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.
Malachi|1|5|And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
Malachi|1|6|A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
Malachi|1|7|Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.
Malachi|1|8|And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|9|And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|10|mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
Malachi|1|11|great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|1|12|But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.
Malachi|1|13|Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.
Malachi|1|14|
Malachi|2|1|And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
Malachi|2|2|If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.
Malachi|2|3|Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and ye shall be taken away with it.
Malachi|2|4|And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant may be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|5|My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and stood in awe of my name.
Malachi|2|6|The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.
Malachi|2|7|For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|8|But ye are turned aside out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|9|Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have had respect of persons in the law.
Malachi|2|10|Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
Malachi|2|11|Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah which he loveth, and hath married the daughter of a foreign god.
Malachi|2|12|Jehovah will cut off, to the man that doeth this, him that waketh and him that answereth, out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|2|13|And this again ye do: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, neither receiveth it with good will at your hand.
Malachi|2|14|Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously, though she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
Malachi|2|15|And did he not make one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? And wherefore one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
Malachi|2|16|For I hate putting away, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, and him that covereth his garment with violence, saith Jehovah of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
Malachi|2|17|
Malachi|3|1|Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|2|But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap:
Malachi|3|3|and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.
Malachi|3|4|Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
Malachi|3|5|, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|6|For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
Malachi|3|7|From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?
Malachi|3|8|Will a man rob God? yet ye rob me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
Malachi|3|9|Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.
Malachi|3|10|.
Malachi|3|11|And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|12|And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|3|13|Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?
Malachi|3|14|Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
Malachi|3|15|And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.
Malachi|3|16|Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.
Malachi|3|17|mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
Malachi|3|18|
Malachi|4|1|For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
Malachi|4|2|But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.
Malachi|4|3|And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Malachi|4|4|Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
Malachi|4|5|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.
Malachi|4|6|
Zechariah|1|1|In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
Zechariah|1|2|Jehovah was sore displeased with your fathers.
Zechariah|1|3|Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|1|4|Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|1|5|Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
Zechariah|1|6|But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
Zechariah|1|7|Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
Zechariah|1|8|I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
Zechariah|1|9|Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.
Zechariah|1|10|And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
Zechariah|1|11|And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
Zechariah|1|12|Then the angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
Zechariah|1|13|comfortable words.
Zechariah|1|14|So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
Zechariah|1|15|And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
Zechariah|1|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|17|Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|18|And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.
Zechariah|1|19|And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
Zechariah|1|20|And Jehovah showed me four smiths.
Zechariah|1|21|
Zechariah|2|1|And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah|2|2|Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
Zechariah|2|3|And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
Zechariah|2|4|and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
Zechariah|2|5|For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
Zechariah|2|6|Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|2|7|Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
Zechariah|2|8|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
Zechariah|2|9|For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.
Zechariah|2|10|Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|2|11|And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee.
Zechariah|2|12|And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah|2|13|
Zechariah|3|1|And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
Zechariah|3|2|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan; yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
Zechariah|3|3|Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.
Zechariah|3|4|And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with rich apparel.
Zechariah|3|5|And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing by.
Zechariah|3|6|And the angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,
Zechariah|3|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee a place of access among these that stand by.
Zechariah|3|8|Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.
Zechariah|3|9|For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
Zechariah|3|10|
Zechariah|4|1|And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
Zechariah|4|2|And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and, behold, a candlestick all of gold, with its bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
Zechariah|4|3|and two olive-trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.
Zechariah|4|4|And I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
Zechariah|4|5|Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Zechariah|4|6|Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|4|7|a plain; and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of Grace, grace, unto it.
Zechariah|4|8|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|4|9|The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.
Zechariah|4|10|the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Zechariah|4|11|Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?
Zechariah|4|12|out of themselves?
Zechariah|4|13|And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Zechariah|4|14|
Zechariah|5|1|Then again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a flying roll.
Zechariah|5|2|And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
Zechariah|5|3|Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off on the one side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off on the other side according to it.
Zechariah|5|4|I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
Zechariah|5|5|Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.
Zechariah|5|6|And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their appearance in all the land
Zechariah|5|7|(and, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead); and this is a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
Zechariah|5|8|And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her down into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
Zechariah|5|9|Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings; now they had wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven.
Zechariah|5|10|Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?
Zechariah|5|11|
Zechariah|6|1|And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
Zechariah|6|2|In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;
Zechariah|6|3|and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.
Zechariah|6|4|Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?
Zechariah|6|5|And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
Zechariah|6|6|wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.
Zechariah|6|7|And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
Zechariah|6|8|Then cried he to me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
Zechariah|6|9|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|6|10|Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon;
Zechariah|6|11|silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;
Zechariah|6|12|and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of Jehovah;
Zechariah|6|13|even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
Zechariah|6|14|And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah.
Zechariah|6|15|
Zechariah|7|1|of the ninth month, even in Chislev.
Zechariah|7|2|Beth-el had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to entreat the favor of Jehovah,
Zechariah|7|3|to speak unto the priests of the house of Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
Zechariah|7|4|Then came the word of Jehovah of hosts unto me, saying,
Zechariah|7|5|, even these seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
Zechariah|7|6|And when ye eat, and when ye drink, do not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
Zechariah|7|7|the words which Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?
Zechariah|7|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,
Zechariah|7|9|Thus hath Jehovah of hosts spoken, saying, Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother;
Zechariah|7|10|and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.
Zechariah|7|11|But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.
Zechariah|7|12|Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which Jehovah of hosts had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets: therefore there came great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|7|13|And it is come to pass that, as he cried, and they would not hear, so they shall cry, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of hosts;
Zechariah|7|14|
Zechariah|8|1|, saying,
Zechariah|8|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
Zechariah|8|3|Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy mountain.
Zechariah|8|4|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
Zechariah|8|5|And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
Zechariah|8|6|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;
Zechariah|8|8|and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
Zechariah|8|9|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.
Zechariah|8|10|For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
Zechariah|8|11|But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Zechariah|8|12|the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
Zechariah|8|13|let your hands be strong.
Zechariah|8|14|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I repented not;
Zechariah|8|15|so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
Zechariah|8|16|These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;
Zechariah|8|17|and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|18|And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,
Zechariah|8|19|, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.
Zechariah|8|20|, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;
Zechariah|8|21|shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.
Zechariah|8|22|Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.
Zechariah|8|23|
Zechariah|9|1|its resting-place (for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Jehovah);
Zechariah|9|2|and Hamath, also, which bordereth thereon; Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.
Zechariah|9|3|And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
Zechariah|9|4|Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
Zechariah|9|5|Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also, and shall be sore pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
Zechariah|9|6|And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah|9|7|And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth; and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chieftain in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
Zechariah|9|8|And I will encamp about my house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
Zechariah|9|9|Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
Zechariah|9|10|And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the nations: and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah|9|11|As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I have set free thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.
Zechariah|9|12|Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.
Zechariah|9|13|For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
Zechariah|9|14|And Jehovah shall be seen over them; and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
Zechariah|9|15|Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, like the corners of the altar.
Zechariah|9|16|the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land.
Zechariah|9|17|
Zechariah|10|1|Jehovah that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
Zechariah|10|2|For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
Zechariah|10|3|Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.
Zechariah|10|4|From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
Zechariah|10|5|in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because Jehovah is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
Zechariah|10|6|And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will hear them.
Zechariah|10|7|Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in Jehovah.
Zechariah|10|8|I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.
Zechariah|10|9|And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
Zechariah|10|10|shall not be found for them.
Zechariah|10|11|And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
Zechariah|10|12|
Zechariah|11|1|Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
Zechariah|11|2|Wail, O fir-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the goodly ones are destroyed: wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.
Zechariah|11|3|A voice of the wailing of the shepherds! for their glory is destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions! for the pride of the Jordan is laid waste.
Zechariah|11|4|Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
Zechariah|11|5|whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.
Zechariah|11|6|For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbor’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
Zechariah|11|7|So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.
Zechariah|11|8|And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.
Zechariah|11|9|Then said I, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.
Zechariah|11|10|And I took my staff Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
Zechariah|11|11|And it was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|12|of silver.
Zechariah|11|13|of silver, and cast them unto the potter, in the house of Jehovah.
Zechariah|11|14|Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah|11|15|And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah|11|16|, and will tear their hoofs in pieces.
Zechariah|11|17|
Zechariah|12|1|saith Jehovah, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him:
Zechariah|12|2|behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of reeling unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|3|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
Zechariah|12|4|In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with terror, and his rider with madness; and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.
Zechariah|12|5|And the chieftains of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Jehovah of hosts their God.
Zechariah|12|6|Jerusalem shall yet again dwell in their own place, even in Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|7|Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.
Zechariah|12|8|In that day shall Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them.
Zechariah|12|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
Zechariah|12|10|And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.
Zechariah|12|11|In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
Zechariah|12|12|And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|13|the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of the Shimeites apart, and their wives apart;
Zechariah|12|14|
Zechariah|13|1|In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
Zechariah|13|2|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
Zechariah|13|3|And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
Zechariah|13|4|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:
Zechariah|13|5|but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
Zechariah|13|6|And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
Zechariah|13|7|Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
Zechariah|13|8|And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith Jehovah, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
Zechariah|13|9|
Zechariah|14|1|Behold, a day of Jehovah cometh, when thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
Zechariah|14|2|For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
Zechariah|14|3|Then shall Jehovah go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
Zechariah|14|4|a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
Zechariah|14|5|And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azel; yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee.
Zechariah|14|6|And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the bright ones shall withdraw themselves:
Zechariah|14|7|but it shall be one day which is known unto Jehovah; not day, and not night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light.
Zechariah|14|8|And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.
Zechariah|14|9|And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall Jehovah be one, and his name one.
Zechariah|14|10|All the land shall be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up, and shall dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel unto the king’s wine-presses.
Zechariah|14|11|And men shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more curse; but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
Zechariah|14|12|And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
Zechariah|14|13|And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
Zechariah|14|14|And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
Zechariah|14|15|And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, as that plague.
Zechariah|14|16|And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|17|the families of the earth goeth not up unto Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there shall be no rain.
Zechariah|14|18|upon them; there shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|19|This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
Zechariah|14|20|In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLY UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar.
Zechariah|14|21|

Judges|1|1|And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the children of Israel asked of Jehovah, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?
Judges|1|2|And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
Judges|1|3|And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
Judges|1|4|And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
Judges|1|5|And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
Judges|1|6|But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
Judges|1|7|
Judges|1|8|And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
Judges|1|9|And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
Judges|1|10|
Judges|1|11|And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.)
Judges|1|12|And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Judges|1|13|And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Judges|1|14|, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
Judges|1|15|
Judges|1|16|And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people.
Judges|1|17|And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
Judges|1|18|Also Judah took Gaza with the border thereof, and Ashkelon with the border thereof, and Ekron with the border thereof.
Judges|1|19|the hill-country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
Judges|1|20|And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and he drove out thence the three sons of Anak.
Judges|1|21|
Judges|1|22|And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el; and Jehovah was with them.
Judges|1|23|And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Beth-el. (Now the name of the city beforetime was Luz.)
Judges|1|24|And the watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.
Judges|1|25|And he showed them the entrance into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go and all his family.
Judges|1|26|
Judges|1|27|Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Judges|1|28|
Judges|1|29|
Judges|1|30|
Judges|1|31|Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
Judges|1|32|
Judges|1|33|
Judges|1|34|And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley;
Judges|1|35|but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to taskwork.
Judges|1|36|
Judges|2|1|And the angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:
Judges|2|2|and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this?
Judges|2|3|in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
Judges|2|4|And it came to pass, when the angel of Jehovah spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
Judges|2|5|
Judges|2|6|Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
Judges|2|7|And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Jehovah that he had wrought for Israel.
Judges|2|8|And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
Judges|2|9|And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Judges|2|10|
Judges|2|11|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim;
Judges|2|12|and they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked Jehovah to anger.
Judges|2|13|And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
Judges|2|14|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
Judges|2|15|
Judges|2|16|And Jehovah raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.
Judges|2|17|they did not so.
Judges|2|18|And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented Jehovah because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
Judges|2|19|But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
Judges|2|20|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
Judges|2|21|I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
Judges|2|22|that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
Judges|2|23|
Judges|3|1|as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
Judges|3|2|only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof:
Judges|3|3|, the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.
Judges|3|4|, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.
Judges|3|5|And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
Judges|3|6|
Judges|3|7|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgat Jehovah their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.
Judges|3|8|Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.
Judges|3|9|And when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
Judges|3|10|And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.
Judges|3|11|
Judges|3|12|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
Judges|3|13|And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm-trees.
Judges|3|14|
Judges|3|15|But when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. And the children of Israel sent tribute by him unto Eglon the king of Moab.
Judges|3|16|And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
Judges|3|17|And he offered the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.
Judges|3|18|And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people that bare the tribute.
Judges|3|19|But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
Judges|3|20|And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
Judges|3|21|And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:
Judges|3|22|and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
Judges|3|23|
Judges|3|24|Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.
Judges|3|25|
Judges|3|26|And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirah.
Judges|3|27|And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
Judges|3|28|And he said unto them, Follow after me; for Jehovah hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and suffered not a man to pass over.
Judges|3|29|And they smote of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.
Judges|3|30|
Judges|3|31|
Judges|4|1|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, when Ehud was dead.
Judges|4|2|And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
Judges|4|3|
Judges|4|4|Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
Judges|4|5|And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
Judges|4|6|, Go and draw unto mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
Judges|4|7|And I will draw unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
Judges|4|8|And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
Judges|4|9|And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding, the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honor; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges|4|10|
Judges|4|11|
Judges|4|12|And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
Judges|4|13|And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, unto the river Kishon.
Judges|4|14|And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not Jehovah gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
Judges|4|15|And Jehovah discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
Judges|4|16|
Judges|4|17|Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges|4|18|And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
Judges|4|19|And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
Judges|4|20|And he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
Judges|4|21|Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
Judges|4|22|
Judges|4|23|So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.

Judges|6|1|And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
Judges|6|2|And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
Judges|6|3|And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;
Judges|6|4|and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
Judges|6|5|For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
Judges|6|6|
Judges|6|7|And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah because of Midian,
Judges|6|8|that Jehovah sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
Judges|6|9|and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
Judges|6|10|
Judges|6|11|And the angel of Jehovah came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
Judges|6|12|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him, and said unto him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
Judges|6|13|And Gideon said unto him, Oh, my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? but now Jehovah hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
Judges|6|14|And Jehovah looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee?
Judges|6|15|And he said unto him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
Judges|6|16|And Jehovah said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
Judges|6|17|And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.
Judges|6|18|
Judges|6|19|And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
Judges|6|20|And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
Judges|6|21|Then the angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
Judges|6|22|And Gideon saw that he was the angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face.
Judges|6|23|And Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
Judges|6|24|
Judges|6|25|And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Take thy father’s bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
Judges|6|26|and build an altar unto Jehovah thy God upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.
Judges|6|27|
Judges|6|28|And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
Judges|6|29|And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
Judges|6|30|Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.
Judges|6|31|morning: if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.
Judges|6|32|
Judges|6|33|Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
Judges|6|34|But the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
Judges|6|35|
Judges|6|36|And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken,
Judges|6|37|behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.
Judges|6|38|And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
Judges|6|39|And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
Judges|6|40|
Judges|7|1|
Judges|7|2|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
Judges|7|3|
Judges|7|4|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
Judges|7|5|So he brought down the people unto the water: and Jehovah said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
Judges|7|6|And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
Judges|7|7|And Jehovah said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.
Judges|7|8|
Judges|7|9|And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said unto him, Arise, get thee down into the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
Judges|7|10|But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp:
Judges|7|11|and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant unto the outermost part of the armed men that were in the camp.
Judges|7|12|And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.
Judges|7|13|And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
Judges|7|14|
Judges|7|15|And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
Judges|7|16|And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
Judges|7|17|And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
Judges|7|18|
Judges|7|19|So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
Judges|7|20|And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.
Judges|7|21|to flight.
Judges|7|22|And they blew the three hundred trumpets, and Jehovah set every man’s sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
Judges|7|23|
Judges|7|24|And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.
Judges|7|25|
Judges|8|1|And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him sharply.
Judges|8|2|And he said unto them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
Judges|8|3|
Judges|8|4|passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
Judges|8|5|And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.
Judges|8|6|And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?
Judges|8|7|And Gideon said, Therefore when Jehovah hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
Judges|8|8|And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
Judges|8|9|
Judges|8|10|Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
Judges|8|11|And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
Judges|8|12|
Judges|8|13|And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
Judges|8|14|And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
Judges|8|15|And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
Judges|8|16|And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
Judges|8|17|
Judges|8|18|Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
Judges|8|19|And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as Jehovah liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
Judges|8|20|And he said unto Jether his first-born, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
Judges|8|21|
Judges|8|22|Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.
Judges|8|23|And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.
Judges|8|24|And Gideon said unto them, I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
Judges|8|25|And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.
Judges|8|26|of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
Judges|8|27|And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the harlot after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
Judges|8|28|
Judges|8|29|And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
Judges|8|30|And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.
Judges|8|31|And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
Judges|8|32|
Judges|8|33|And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
Judges|8|34|And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
Judges|8|35|
Judges|9|1|And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spake with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
Judges|9|2|Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
Judges|9|3|And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
Judges|9|4|of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.
Judges|9|5|And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
Judges|9|6|
Judges|9|7|And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
Judges|9|8|The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
Judges|9|9|But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|10|And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|11|But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|12|And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|13|And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?
Judges|9|14|Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
Judges|9|15|And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
Judges|9|16|Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands
Judges|9|17|(for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
Judges|9|18|and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
Judges|9|19|if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
Judges|9|20|but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
Judges|9|21|
Judges|9|22|And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
Judges|9|23|And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
Judges|9|24|that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
Judges|9|25|
Judges|9|26|And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
Judges|9|27|, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
Judges|9|28|And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him?
Judges|9|29|
Judges|9|30|And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
Judges|9|31|against thee.
Judges|9|32|Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
Judges|9|33|
Judges|9|34|And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
Judges|9|35|And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.
Judges|9|36|And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
Judges|9|37|And Gaal spake again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
Judges|9|38|Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
Judges|9|39|And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
Judges|9|40|
Judges|9|41|And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
Judges|9|42|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
Judges|9|43|And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; And he rose up against them, and smote them.
Judges|9|44|And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
Judges|9|45|
Judges|9|46|And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
Judges|9|47|And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
Judges|9|48|And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
Judges|9|49|
Judges|9|50|Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
Judges|9|51|But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower.
Judges|9|52|And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
Judges|9|53|And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and brake his skull.
Judges|9|54|Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
Judges|9|55|And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
Judges|9|56|Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren;
Judges|9|57|
Judges|10|1|And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.
Judges|10|2|
Judges|10|3|And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.
Judges|10|4|And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
Judges|10|5|
Judges|10|6|And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah, and served him not.
Judges|10|7|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
Judges|10|8|all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
Judges|10|9|
Judges|10|10|And the children of Israel cried unto Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.
Judges|10|11|from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
Judges|10|12|The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand.
Judges|10|13|Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will save you no more.
Judges|10|14|Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
Judges|10|15|And the children of Israel said unto Jehovah, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
Judges|10|16|
Judges|10|17|Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
Judges|10|18|
Judges|11|1|Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
Judges|11|2|And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.
Judges|11|3|
Judges|11|4|And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
Judges|11|5|And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
Judges|11|6|and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|7|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
Judges|11|8|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Judges|11|9|And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Jehovah deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
Judges|11|10|And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Jehovah shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
Judges|11|11|
Judges|11|12|And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?
Judges|11|13|again peaceably.
Judges|11|14|And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon;
Judges|11|15|and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
Judges|11|16|but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
Judges|11|17|then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
Judges|11|18|Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
Judges|11|19|And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
Judges|11|20|But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
Judges|11|21|And Jehovah, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
Judges|11|22|And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
Judges|11|23|So now Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?
Judges|11|24|Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever Jehovah our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
Judges|11|25|And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?
Judges|11|26|While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time?
Judges|11|27|I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: Jehovah, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|28|
Judges|11|29|Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|30|And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
Judges|11|31|then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
Judges|11|32|So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Jehovah delivered them into his hand.
Judges|11|33|
Judges|11|34|And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
Judges|11|35|And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back.
Judges|11|36|And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto Jehovah; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as Jehovah hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon.
Judges|11|37|And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
Judges|11|38|And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
Judges|11|39|And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man. And it was a custom in Israel,
Judges|11|40|
Judges|12|1|And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
Judges|12|2|And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
Judges|12|3|And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
Judges|12|4|in the midst of Manasseh.
Judges|12|5|the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
Judges|12|6|
Judges|12|7|
Judges|12|8|And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
Judges|12|9|And he had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Judges|12|10|And Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
Judges|12|11|And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
Judges|12|12|
Judges|12|13|And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
Judges|12|14|And he had forty sons and thirty sons’ sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
Judges|12|15|
Judges|13|1|
Judges|13|2|And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
Judges|13|3|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
Judges|13|4|Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
Judges|13|5|for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
Judges|13|6|Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:
Judges|13|7|
Judges|13|8|Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
Judges|13|9|And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
Judges|13|10|day.
Judges|13|11|And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
Judges|13|12|shall we do unto him?
Judges|13|13|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
Judges|13|14|
Judges|13|15|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
Judges|13|16|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|17|And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?
Judges|13|18|And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
Judges|13|19|did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
Judges|13|20|
Judges|13|21|But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.
Judges|13|22|And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
Judges|13|23|But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
Judges|13|24|And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.
Judges|13|25|
Judges|14|1|And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges|14|2|And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.
Judges|14|3|Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
Judges|14|4|
Judges|14|5|Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.
Judges|14|6|And the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges|14|7|And he went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
Judges|14|8|And after a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
Judges|14|9|
Judges|14|10|And his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
Judges|14|11|And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
Judges|14|12|And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;
Judges|14|13|but if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.
Judges|14|14|And they could not in three days declare the riddle.
Judges|14|15|?
Judges|14|16|And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell thee?
Judges|14|17|And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
Judges|14|18|
Judges|14|19|unto them that declared the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.
Judges|14|20|
Judges|15|1|But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
Judges|15|2|And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
Judges|15|3|And Samson said unto them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
Judges|15|4|And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
Judges|15|5|And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the oliveyards.
Judges|15|6|Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
Judges|15|7|And Samson said unto them, If ye do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
Judges|15|8|
Judges|15|9|Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
Judges|15|10|And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.
Judges|15|11|Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
Judges|15|12|And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
Judges|15|13|
Judges|15|14|When he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.
Judges|15|15|And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and smote a thousand men therewith.
Judges|15|16|
Judges|15|17|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.
Judges|15|18|And he was sore athirst, and called on Jehovah, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.
Judges|15|19|But God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi, unto this day.
Judges|15|20|
Judges|16|1|And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her.
Judges|16|2|till morning light, then we will kill him.
Judges|16|3|
Judges|16|4|And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
Judges|16|5|of silver.
Judges|16|6|And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.
Judges|16|7|And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withes that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|8|Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
Judges|16|9|
Judges|16|10|And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.
Judges|16|11|And he said unto her, If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.
Judges|16|12|
Judges|16|13|And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
Judges|16|14|
Judges|16|15|And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.
Judges|16|16|And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was vexed unto death.
Judges|16|17|And he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
Judges|16|18|And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.
Judges|16|19|And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
Judges|16|20|And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But he knew not that Jehovah was departed from him.
Judges|16|21|And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
Judges|16|22|
Judges|16|23|And the lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
Judges|16|24|And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.
Judges|16|25|And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them. And they set him between the pillars:
Judges|16|26|and Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.
Judges|16|27|
Judges|16|28|And Samson called unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
Judges|16|29|And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.
Judges|16|30|And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life.
Judges|16|31|
Judges|17|1|And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
Judges|17|2|of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah.
Judges|17|3|of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
Judges|17|4|of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|5|And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
Judges|17|6|
Judges|17|7|And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
Judges|17|8|, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
Judges|17|9|.
Judges|17|10|of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
Judges|17|11|And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
Judges|17|12|And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Judges|17|13|
Judges|18|1|inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
Judges|18|2|And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land. And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.
Judges|18|3|When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
Judges|18|4|And he said unto them, Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.
Judges|18|5|And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
Judges|18|6|
Judges|18|7|to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.
Judges|18|8|ye?
Judges|18|9|And they said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
Judges|18|10|
Judges|18|11|And there set forth from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|12|And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan, unto this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath-jearim.
Judges|18|13|
Judges|18|14|Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
Judges|18|15|And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.
Judges|18|16|And the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
Judges|18|17|And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
Judges|18|18|And when these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the graven image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them, What do ye?
Judges|18|19|And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be priest unto the house of one man, or to be priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
Judges|18|20|
Judges|18|21|So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.
Judges|18|22|When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
Judges|18|23|And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
Judges|18|24|And he said, ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say ye unto me, What aileth thee?
Judges|18|25|And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
Judges|18|26|
Judges|18|27|And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
Judges|18|28|And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.
Judges|18|29|And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.
Judges|18|30|And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges|18|31|
Judges|19|1|And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
Judges|19|2|And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there the space of four months.
Judges|19|3|And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
Judges|19|4|And his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
Judges|19|5|And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.
Judges|19|6|So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel’s father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
Judges|19|7|And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
Judges|19|8|And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel’s father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them.
Judges|19|9|
Judges|19|10|But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.
Judges|19|11|When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
Judges|19|12|And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.
Judges|19|13|And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
Judges|19|14|So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
Judges|19|15|
Judges|19|16|And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even: now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
Judges|19|17|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
Judges|19|18|going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.
Judges|19|19|Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything.
Judges|19|20|And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
Judges|19|21|
Judges|19|22|As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
Judges|19|23|And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
Judges|19|24|Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly.
Judges|19|25|But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
Judges|19|26|
Judges|19|27|And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
Judges|19|28|And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.
Judges|19|29|And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
Judges|19|30|
Judges|20|1|Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.
Judges|20|2|And the chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
Judges|20|3|(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
Judges|20|4|And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
Judges|20|5|And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.
Judges|20|6|And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
Judges|20|7|
Judges|20|8|And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house.
Judges|20|9|against it by lot;
Judges|20|10|and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
Judges|20|11|
Judges|20|12|And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?
Judges|20|13|Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.
Judges|20|14|And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
Judges|20|15|And the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
Judges|20|16|
Judges|20|17|And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
Judges|20|18|
Judges|20|19|And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
Judges|20|20|And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
Judges|20|21|And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.
Judges|20|22|And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
Judges|20|23|
Judges|20|24|And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
Judges|20|25|And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
Judges|20|26|Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
Judges|20|27|And the children of Israel asked of Jehovah (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
Judges|20|28|
Judges|20|29|And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.
Judges|20|30|And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
Judges|20|31|And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
Judges|20|32|And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.
Judges|20|33|And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers-in-wait of Israel brake forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.
Judges|20|34|And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they knew not that evil was close upon them.
Judges|20|35|
Judges|20|36|So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted unto the liers-in-wait whom they had set against Gibeah.
Judges|20|37|And the liers-in-wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
Judges|20|38|Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
Judges|20|39|And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
Judges|20|40|to heaven.
Judges|20|41|And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil was come upon them.
Judges|20|42|Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst thereof.
Judges|20|43|resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
Judges|20|44|men of valor.
Judges|20|45|And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.
Judges|20|46|men of valor.
Judges|20|47|But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
Judges|20|48|
Judges|21|1|Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
Judges|21|2|And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
Judges|21|3|And they said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?
Judges|21|4|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
Judges|21|5|And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
Judges|21|6|And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
Judges|21|7|
Judges|21|8|And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto Jehovah to Mizpah? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
Judges|21|9|For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
Judges|21|10|And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.
Judges|21|11|And this is the thing that ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
Judges|21|12|
Judges|21|13|And the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.
Judges|21|14|And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
Judges|21|15|
Judges|21|16|Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
Judges|21|17|And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.
Judges|21|18|Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
Judges|21|19|And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
Judges|21|20|And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
Judges|21|21|and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges|21|22|his wife in battle, neither did ye give them unto them, else would ye now be guilty.
Judges|21|23|And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.

Revelation|1|11|to the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamum, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
Revelation|1|12|And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And having turned I saw seven golden candlesticks;
Revelation|1|13|and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto a son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation|1|14|as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
Revelation|1|15|and his feet like unto burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.
Revelation|1|16|And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

Revelation|2|5|Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.

Revelation|2|14|But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.

Revelation|2|25|Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
Revelation|2|26|And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:
Revelation|2|27|and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:
Revelation|2|28|and I will give him the morning star.
Revelation|2|29|
Revelation|3|1|And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and thou art dead.
Revelation|3|2|Be thou watchful, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die: for I have found no works of thine perfected before my God.
Revelation|3|3|, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
Revelation|3|4|But thou hast a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments: and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.
Revelation|3|5|He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
Revelation|3|6|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|7|And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none openeth:
Revelation|3|8|I know thy works (behold, I have set before thee a door opened, which none can shut), that thou hast a little power, and didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name.
Revelation|3|9|Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
Revelation|3|10|which is to come upon the whole world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Revelation|3|11|I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.
Revelation|3|12|He that overcometh, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out thence no more: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and mine own new name.
Revelation|3|13|He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.
Revelation|3|14|And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
Revelation|3|15|I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
Revelation|3|16|So because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
Revelation|3|17|Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art the wretched one and miserable and poor and blind and naked:
Revelation|3|18|the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest; and eyesalve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see.
Revelation|3|19|As many as I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
Revelation|3|20|Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
Revelation|3|21|He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.
Revelation|3|22|
Revelation|4|1|as of a trumpet speaking with me, one saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter.
Revelation|4|2|Straightway I was in the Spirit: and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne;
Revelation|4|3|a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.
Revelation|4|4|four and twenty elders sitting, arrayed in white garments; and on their heads crowns of gold.
Revelation|4|5|seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
Revelation|4|6|and before the throne, as it were a sea of glass like a crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
Revelation|4|7|like a flying eagle.
Revelation|4|8|
Revelation|4|9|And when the living creatures shall give glory and honor and thanks to him that sitteth on the throne, to him that liveth for ever and ever,
Revelation|4|10|
Revelation|4|11|
Revelation|5|1|And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.
Revelation|5|2|And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
Revelation|5|3|And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
Revelation|5|4|And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:
Revelation|5|5|and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
Revelation|5|6|And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.
Revelation|5|7|out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
Revelation|5|8|And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation|5|9|of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
Revelation|5|10|
Revelation|5|11|And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
Revelation|5|12|
Revelation|5|13|
Revelation|5|14|
Revelation|6|1|And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, Come.
Revelation|6|2|And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown: and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.
Revelation|6|3|And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.
Revelation|6|4|came forth, a red horse: and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.
Revelation|6|5|And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he that sat thereon had a balance in his hand.
Revelation|6|6|And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not.
Revelation|6|7|And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.
Revelation|6|8|And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation|6|9|And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
Revelation|6|10|and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
Revelation|6|11|.
Revelation|6|12|And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;
Revelation|6|13|and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.
Revelation|6|14|And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
Revelation|6|15|And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;
Revelation|6|16|and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
Revelation|6|17|
Revelation|7|1|After his I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.
Revelation|7|2|And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
Revelation|7|3|saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.
Revelation|7|4|
Revelation|7|5|
Revelation|7|6|
Revelation|7|7|
Revelation|7|8|
Revelation|7|9|tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;
Revelation|7|10|
Revelation|7|11|the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
Revelation|7|12|
Revelation|7|13|And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they?
Revelation|7|14|And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation|7|15|Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.
Revelation|7|16|They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:
Revelation|7|17|
Revelation|8|1|And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
Revelation|8|2|And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.
Revelation|8|3|And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
Revelation|8|4|And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.
Revelation|8|5|And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
Revelation|8|6|And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
Revelation|8|7|And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
Revelation|8|8|And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
Revelation|8|9|they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.
Revelation|8|10|And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters;
Revelation|8|11|and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
Revelation|8|12|And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.
Revelation|8|13|
Revelation|9|1|And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.
Revelation|9|2|And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
Revelation|9|3|And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
Revelation|9|4|And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation|9|5|And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.
Revelation|9|6|And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.
Revelation|9|7|And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men’s faces.
Revelation|9|8|of lions.
Revelation|9|9|And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.
Revelation|9|10|And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.
Revelation|9|11|he hath the name Apollyon.
Revelation|9|12|The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.
Revelation|9|13|And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Revelation|9|14|one saying to the sixth angel that had one trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.
Revelation|9|15|And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.
Revelation|9|16|And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.
Revelation|9|17|of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation|9|18|By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.
Revelation|9|19|For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.
Revelation|9|20|And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:
Revelation|9|21|
Revelation|10|1|And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;
Revelation|10|2|and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth;
Revelation|10|3|and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
Revelation|10|4|, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
Revelation|10|5|And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,
Revelation|10|6|and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be delay no longer:
Revelation|10|7|but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished the mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.
Revelation|10|8|again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
Revelation|10|9|And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.
Revelation|10|10|And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.
Revelation|10|11|
Revelation|11|1|And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
Revelation|11|2|And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.
Revelation|11|3|And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
Revelation|11|4|These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation|11|5|And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.
Revelation|11|6|These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.
Revelation|11|7|And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.
Revelation|11|8|in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation|11|9|look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
Revelation|11|10|And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.
Revelation|11|11|And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.
Revelation|11|12|And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
Revelation|11|13|And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation|11|14|The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.
Revelation|11|15|
Revelation|11|16|And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,
Revelation|11|17|We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.
Revelation|11|18|
Revelation|11|19|
Revelation|12|1|And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
Revelation|12|2|and she was the child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered.
Revelation|12|3|And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
Revelation|12|4|And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child.
Revelation|12|5|And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.
Revelation|12|6|And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
Revelation|12|7|to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;
Revelation|12|8|And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.
Revelation|12|9|And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
Revelation|12|10|Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.
Revelation|12|11|And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.
Revelation|12|12|
Revelation|12|13|.
Revelation|12|14|And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
Revelation|12|15|And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.
Revelation|12|16|And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
Revelation|12|17|
Revelation|13|1|and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.
Revelation|13|2|of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
Revelation|13|3|one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;
Revelation|13|4|and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him?
Revelation|13|5|and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.
Revelation|13|6|them that dwell in the heaven.
Revelation|13|7|And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
Revelation|13|8|whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.
Revelation|13|9|If any man hath an ear, let him hear.
Revelation|13|10|for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
Revelation|13|11|And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
Revelation|13|12|And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.
Revelation|13|13|And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.
Revelation|13|14|And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.
Revelation|13|15|to the image to the breast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
Revelation|13|16|And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;
Revelation|13|17|the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation|13|18|
Revelation|14|1|And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
Revelation|14|2|of harpers harping with their harps:
Revelation|14|3|they that had been purchased out of the earth.
Revelation|14|4|the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.
Revelation|14|5|And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.
Revelation|14|6|And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;
Revelation|14|7|and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
Revelation|14|8|And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
Revelation|14|9|And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,
Revelation|14|10|he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
Revelation|14|11|and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.
Revelation|14|12|Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
Revelation|14|13|And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
Revelation|14|14|one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|15|And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
Revelation|14|16|And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
Revelation|14|17|Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|18|And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
Revelation|14|19|, of the wrath of God.
Revelation|14|20|
Revelation|15|1|the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.
Revelation|15|2|And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.
Revelation|15|3|Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.
Revelation|15|4|
Revelation|15|5|And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
Revelation|15|6|bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.
Revelation|15|7|And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
Revelation|15|8|
Revelation|16|1|And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.
Revelation|16|2|And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.
Revelation|16|3|the things that were in the sea.
Revelation|16|4|And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.
Revelation|16|5|And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:
Revelation|16|6|for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.
Revelation|16|7|And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
Revelation|16|8|And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.
Revelation|16|9|And men were scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.
Revelation|16|10|And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
Revelation|16|11|and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.
Revelation|16|12|from the sunrising.
Revelation|16|13|out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:
Revelation|16|14|for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|16|15|(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see his shame.)
Revelation|16|16|And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon.
Revelation|16|17|And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and there came forth a great voice out of the temple, from the throne, saying, It is done:
Revelation|16|18|and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men upon the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
Revelation|16|19|And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
Revelation|16|20|And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
Revelation|16|21|
Revelation|17|1|And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;
Revelation|17|2|with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.
Revelation|17|3|And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation|17|4|And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,
Revelation|17|5|and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation|17|6|And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.
Revelation|17|7|And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.
Revelation|17|8|whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.
Revelation|17|9|Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:
Revelation|17|10|and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.
Revelation|17|11|And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.
Revelation|17|12|And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.
Revelation|17|13|These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.
Revelation|17|14|that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.
Revelation|17|15|And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
Revelation|17|16|And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.
Revelation|17|17|For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.
Revelation|17|18|
Revelation|18|1|After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
Revelation|18|2|And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.
Revelation|18|3|For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness.
Revelation|18|4|And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:
Revelation|18|5|for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
Revelation|18|6|the double according to her works: in the cup which she mingled, mingle unto her double.
Revelation|18|7|How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.
Revelation|18|8|Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.
Revelation|18|9|And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,
Revelation|18|10|standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
Revelation|18|11|And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more;
Revelation|18|12|merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;
Revelation|18|13|of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men.
Revelation|18|14|shall find them no more at all.
Revelation|18|15|The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;
Revelation|18|16|saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl!
Revelation|18|17|for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off,
Revelation|18|18|is like the great city?
Revelation|18|19|And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
Revelation|18|20|Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.
Revelation|18|21|And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all.
Revelation|18|22|And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;
Revelation|18|23|and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.
Revelation|18|24|
Revelation|19|1|Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God:
Revelation|19|2|
Revelation|19|3|And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.
Revelation|19|4|And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.
Revelation|19|5|
Revelation|19|6|Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.
Revelation|19|7|Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
Revelation|19|8|
Revelation|19|9|And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God.
Revelation|19|10|And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
Revelation|19|11|And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
Revelation|19|12|many diadems; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself.
Revelation|19|13|arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
Revelation|19|14|pure.
Revelation|19|15|And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
Revelation|19|16|And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
Revelation|19|17|be gathered together unto the great supper of God;
Revelation|19|18|that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great.
Revelation|19|19|And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army.
Revelation|19|20|And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone:
Revelation|19|21|
Revelation|20|1|And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
Revelation|20|2|And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
Revelation|20|3|over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.
Revelation|20|4|the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Revelation|20|5|The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.
Revelation|20|6|Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
Revelation|20|7|And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
Revelation|20|8|and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
Revelation|20|9|And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.
Revelation|20|10|And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Revelation|20|11|And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
Revelation|20|12|of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.
Revelation|20|13|And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
Revelation|20|14|the lake of fire.
Revelation|20|15|
Revelation|21|1|And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.
Revelation|21|2|And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.
Revelation|21|3|their God:
Revelation|21|4|and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away.
Revelation|21|5|And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.
Revelation|21|6|And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
Revelation|21|7|He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
Revelation|21|8|in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.
Revelation|21|9|And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|10|And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Revelation|21|11|having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:
Revelation|21|12|of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
Revelation|21|13|on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
Revelation|21|14|And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation|21|15|And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
Revelation|21|16|And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.
Revelation|21|17|the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.
Revelation|21|18|And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.
Revelation|21|19|The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
Revelation|21|20|the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
Revelation|21|21|And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
Revelation|21|22|And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.
Revelation|21|23|the Lamb.
Revelation|21|24|And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.
Revelation|21|25|And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):
Revelation|21|26|and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:
Revelation|21|27|
Revelation|22|1|And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,
Revelation|22|2|fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
Revelation|22|3|And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him;
Revelation|22|4|on their foreheads.
Revelation|22|5|And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
Revelation|22|6|And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
Revelation|22|7|And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
Revelation|22|8|And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
Revelation|22|9|And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.
Revelation|22|10|And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
Revelation|22|11|He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still.
Revelation|22|12|Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is.
Revelation|22|13|I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
Revelation|22|14|to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.
Revelation|22|15|Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.
Revelation|22|16|I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.
Revelation|22|17|And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.
Revelation|22|18|I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:
Revelation|22|19|and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
Revelation|22|20|He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation|22|21|
Jude|1|1|Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
Jude|1|2|Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied.
Jude|1|3|Beloved, while I was giving all diligence to write unto you of our common salvation, I was constrained to write unto you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered unto the saints.
Jude|1|4|they who were of old written of beforehand unto this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude|1|5|Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
Jude|1|6|And angels that kept not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Jude|1|7|Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.
Jude|1|8|Yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at nought dominion, and rail at dignities.
Jude|1|9|But Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing judgment, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
Jude|1|10|But these rail at whatsoever things they know not: and what they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in these things are they destroyed.
Jude|1|11|Woe unto them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in the gainsaying of Korah.
Jude|1|12|These are they who are hidden rocks in your love-feasts when they feast with you, shepherds that without fear feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
Jude|1|13|Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved forever.
Jude|1|14|And to these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
Jude|1|15|to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Jude|1|16|), showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage.
Jude|1|17|But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Jude|1|18|That they said to you, In the last time there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.
Jude|1|19|These are they who make separations, sensual, having not the Spirit.
Jude|1|20|But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude|1|21|keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude|1|22|And on some have mercy, who are in doubt;
Jude|1|23|and some save, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.
Jude|1|24|Now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy,
Jude|1|25|
Haggai|1|1|In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
Haggai|1|2|to come, the time for Jehovah’s house to be built.
Haggai|1|3|Then came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|1|4|Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, while this house lieth waste?
Haggai|1|5|Now therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|6|into a bag with holes.
Haggai|1|7|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider your ways.
Haggai|1|8|Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|9|Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith Jehovah of hosts. Because of my house that lieth waste, while ye run every man to his own house.
Haggai|1|10|Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholdeth its fruit.
Haggai|1|11|And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
Haggai|1|12|Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people did fear before Jehovah.
Haggai|1|13|Then spake Haggai Jehovah’s messenger in Jehovah’s message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|1|14|And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work on the house of Jehovah of hosts, their God,
Haggai|1|15|
Haggai|2|1|of the month, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|2|Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
Haggai|2|3|Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes as nothing?
Haggai|2|4|Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith Jehovah; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith Jehovah, and work: for I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts,
Haggai|2|5|the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you: fear ye not.
Haggai|2|6|For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
Haggai|2|7|and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|8|The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|9|The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, saith Jehovah of hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith Jehovah of hosts.
Haggai|2|10|, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Haggai|2|11|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,
Haggai|2|12|If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
Haggai|2|13|Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
Haggai|2|14|Then answered Haggai and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith Jehovah; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
Haggai|2|15|And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah.
Haggai|2|16|, there were but twenty.
Haggai|2|17|not to me, saith Jehovah.
Haggai|2|18|, since the day that the foundation of Jehovah’s temple was laid, consider it.
Haggai|2|19|.
Haggai|2|20|of the month, saying,
Haggai|2|21|Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;
Haggai|2|22|and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
Haggai|2|23|
Obadiah|1|1|, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
Obadiah|1|2|Behold, I have made thee small among the nations: thou art greatly despised.
Obadiah|1|3|The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
Obadiah|1|4|Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thy nest be set among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.
Obadiah|1|5|till they had enough? if grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
Obadiah|1|6|Esau searched! how are his hidden treasures sought out!
Obadiah|1|7|thy bread lay a snare under thee: there is no understanding in him.
Obadiah|1|8|Shall I not in that day, saith Jehovah, destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
Obadiah|1|9|And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
Obadiah|1|10|For the violence done to thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
Obadiah|1|11|In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his substance, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
Obadiah|1|12|But look not thou on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster, and rejoice not over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither speak proudly in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|13|on their substance in the day of their calamity.
Obadiah|1|14|And stand thou not in the crossway, to cut off those of his that escape; and deliver not up those of his that remain in the day of distress.
Obadiah|1|15|For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee; thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
Obadiah|1|16|For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be as though they had not been.
Obadiah|1|17|But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
Obadiah|1|18|And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall burn among them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau; for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Obadiah|1|19|Gilead.
Obadiah|1|20|even unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, that are in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the South.
Obadiah|1|21|
Amos|1|1|The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
Amos|1|2|And he said, Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.
Amos|1|3|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:
Amos|1|4|but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Amos|1|5|And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith Jehovah.
Amos|1|6|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:
Amos|1|7|but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
Amos|1|8|And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|1|9|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:
Amos|1|10|but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
Amos|1|11|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:
Amos|1|12|but I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
Amos|1|13|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.
Amos|1|14|But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
Amos|1|15|
Amos|2|1|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
Amos|2|2|but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;
Amos|2|3|and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith Jehovah.
Amos|2|4|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk:
Amos|2|5|but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
Amos|2|6|Thus saith Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes-
Amos|2|7|maiden, to profane my holy name:
Amos|2|8|and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.
Amos|2|9|Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
Amos|2|10|Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
Amos|2|11|And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith Jehovah.
Amos|2|12|But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
Amos|2|13|in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.
Amos|2|14|And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
Amos|2|15|; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;
Amos|2|16|
Amos|3|1|Hear this word that Jehovah hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Amos|3|2|You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.
Amos|3|3|Shall two walk together, except they have agreed?
Amos|3|4|Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
Amos|3|5|for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?
Amos|3|6|Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?
Amos|3|7|Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets.
Amos|3|8|The lion hath roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken; who can but prophesy?
Amos|3|9|Publish ye in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst thereof.
Amos|3|10|For they know not to do right, saith Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
Amos|3|11|, even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be plundered.
Amos|3|12|Thus saith Jehovah: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.
Amos|3|13|Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord Jehovah, the God of hosts.
Amos|3|14|For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
Amos|3|15|
Amos|4|1|Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords, Bring, and let us drink.
Amos|4|2|The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.
Amos|4|3|into Harmon, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|4|your tithes every three days;
Amos|4|5|and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleaseth you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|4|6|And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|7|And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
Amos|4|8|So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|9|I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|10|I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|11|among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith Jehovah.
Amos|4|12|because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
Amos|4|13|
Amos|5|1|Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.
Amos|5|2|The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
Amos|5|3|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.
Amos|5|4|For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live;
Amos|5|5|but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.
Amos|5|6|Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.
Amos|5|7|Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,
Amos|5|8|that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name);
Amos|5|9|that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.
Amos|5|10|They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
Amos|5|11|Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.
Amos|5|12|.
Amos|5|13|Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.
Amos|5|14|Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.
Amos|5|15|Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
Amos|5|16|Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing.
Amos|5|17|And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
Amos|5|18|Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light.
Amos|5|19|As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
Amos|5|20|Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
Amos|5|21|I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
Amos|5|22|Yea, though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
Amos|5|23|Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
Amos|5|24|But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
Amos|5|25|Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
Amos|5|26|Yea, ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
Amos|5|27|
Amos|6|1|Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!
Amos|6|2|Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?
Amos|6|3|-ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
Amos|6|4|that lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
Amos|6|5|that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol; that invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;
Amos|6|6|that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
Amos|6|7|Therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.
Amos|6|8|The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself, saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
Amos|6|9|And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
Amos|6|10|And when a man’s uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold thy peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Jehovah.
Amos|6|11|For, behold, Jehovah commandeth, and the great house shall be smitten with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
Amos|6|12|with oxen? that ye have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;
Amos|6|13|ye that rejoice in a thing of nought, that say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
Amos|6|14|
Amos|7|1|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
Amos|7|2|And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
Amos|7|3|Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.
Amos|7|4|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.
Amos|7|5|Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
Amos|7|6|Jehovah repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Amos|7|7|Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
Amos|7|8|And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;
Amos|7|9|and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Amos|7|10|Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
Amos|7|11|For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
Amos|7|12|Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
Amos|7|13|but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.
Amos|7|14|Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:
Amos|7|15|and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
Amos|7|16|against the house of Isaac;
Amos|7|17|
Amos|8|1|Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
Amos|8|2|And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Jehovah unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
Amos|8|3|And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.
Amos|8|4|Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,
Amos|8|5|saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;
Amos|8|6|that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
Amos|8|7|Jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Amos|8|8|Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
Amos|8|9|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
Amos|8|10|And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
Amos|8|11|Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.
Amos|8|12|And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it.
Amos|8|13|In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.
Amos|8|14|
Amos|9|1|I saw the Lord standing beside the altar: and he said, Smite the capitals, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.
Amos|9|2|Though they dig into Sheol, thence shall my hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
Amos|9|3|And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
Amos|9|4|And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
Amos|9|5|he that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and it shall rise up wholly like the River, and shall sink again, like the River of Egypt;
Amos|9|6|he that buildeth his chambers in the heavens, and hath founded his vault upon the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; Jehovah is his name.
Amos|9|7|Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith Jehovah. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
Amos|9|8|Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; save that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah.
Amos|9|9|is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least kernel fall upon the earth.
Amos|9|10|All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, The evil shall not overtake nor meet us.
Amos|9|11|In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
Amos|9|12|that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations that are called by my name, saith Jehovah that doeth this.
Amos|9|13|Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
Amos|9|14|And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
Amos|9|15|
Joshua|1|1|Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,
Joshua|1|2|Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
Joshua|1|3|Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spake unto Moses.
Joshua|1|4|From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
Joshua|1|5|There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Joshua|1|6|Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
Joshua|1|7|Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.
Joshua|1|8|This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
Joshua|1|9|
Joshua|1|10|Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Joshua|1|11|
Joshua|1|12|And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
Joshua|1|13|Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God giveth you rest, and will give you this land.
Joshua|1|14|Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;
Joshua|1|15|you, and they also have possessed the land which Jehovah your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|1|16|And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.
Joshua|1|17|According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Jehovah thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
Joshua|1|18|
Joshua|2|1|And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.
Joshua|2|2|And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel to search out the land.
Joshua|2|3|And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, that are entered into thy house; for they are come to search out all the land.
Joshua|2|4|And the woman took the two men, and hid them; and she said, Yea, the men came unto me, but I knew not whence they were:
Joshua|2|5|and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; whither the men went I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
Joshua|2|6|But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
Joshua|2|7|
Joshua|2|8|And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;
Joshua|2|9|and she said unto the men, I know that Jehovah hath given you the land, and that the fear of you is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
Joshua|2|10|For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, unto Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
Joshua|2|11|And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Jehovah your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.
Joshua|2|12|Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true token;
Joshua|2|13|and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.
Joshua|2|14|
Joshua|2|15|Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
Joshua|2|16|And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers light upon you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
Joshua|2|17|And the men said unto her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|18|Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt gather unto thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household.
Joshua|2|19|And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
Joshua|2|20|But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
Joshua|2|21|
Joshua|2|22|And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
Joshua|2|23|Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.
Joshua|2|24|
Joshua|3|1|And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they lodged there before they passed over.
Joshua|3|2|And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp;
Joshua|3|3|and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
Joshua|3|4|Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
Joshua|3|5|And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.
Joshua|3|6|
Joshua|3|7|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
Joshua|3|8|And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
Joshua|3|9|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
Joshua|3|10|And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua|3|11|Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the Jordan.
Joshua|3|12|Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
Joshua|3|13|
Joshua|3|14|And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, the priests that bare the ark of the covenant being before the people;
Joshua|3|15|and when they that bare the ark were come unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
Joshua|3|16|that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
Joshua|3|17|
Joshua|4|1|And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|4|2|Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
Joshua|4|3|and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.
Joshua|4|4|Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:
Joshua|4|5|and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua|4|6|that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
Joshua|4|7|
Joshua|4|8|And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
Joshua|4|9|And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
Joshua|4|10|For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
Joshua|4|11|And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of Jehovah passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
Joshua|4|12|And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:
Joshua|4|13|about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before Jehovah unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
Joshua|4|14|
Joshua|4|15|And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|4|16|Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua|4|17|Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
Joshua|4|18|
Joshua|4|19|And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
Joshua|4|20|And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
Joshua|4|21|And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
Joshua|4|22|Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
Joshua|4|23|For Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over;
Joshua|4|24|
Joshua|5|1|
Joshua|5|2|At that time Jehovah said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
Joshua|5|3|And Joshua made him knives of lint, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
Joshua|5|4|And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.
Joshua|5|5|For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.
Joshua|5|6|For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah: unto whom Jehovah sware that he would not let them see the land which Jehovah sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Joshua|5|7|And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them did Joshua circumcise: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
Joshua|5|8|And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
Joshua|5|9|
Joshua|5|10|And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.
Joshua|5|11|And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.
Joshua|5|12|
Joshua|5|13|And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
Joshua|5|14|prince of the host of Jehovah am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
Joshua|5|15|
Joshua|6|1|Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
Joshua|6|2|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valor.
Joshua|6|3|And ye shall compass the city, all the men of war, going about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.
Joshua|6|4|And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
Joshua|6|5|And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him.
Joshua|6|6|And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|7|
Joshua|6|8|And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before Jehovah passed on, and blew the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah followed them.
Joshua|6|9|blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua|6|10|And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
Joshua|6|11|
Joshua|6|12|And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|13|blowing the trumpets as they went.
Joshua|6|14|
Joshua|6|15|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on the day they compassed the city seven times.
Joshua|6|16|And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for Jehovah hath given you the city.
Joshua|6|17|And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein, to Jehovah: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
Joshua|6|18|But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when ye have devoted it, ye take of the devoted thing; so would ye make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
Joshua|6|19|But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy unto Jehovah: they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|20|blew the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
Joshua|6|21|
Joshua|6|22|And Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.
Joshua|6|23|And the young men the spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; all her kindred also they brought out; and they set them without the camp of Israel.
Joshua|6|24|And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein; only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
Joshua|6|25|But Rahab the harlot, and her father’s household, and all that she had, did Joshua save alive; and she dwelt in the midst of Israel unto this day, because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua|6|26|And Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: with the loss of his first-born shall he lay the foundation thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
Joshua|6|27|
Joshua|7|1|
Joshua|7|2|And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
Joshua|7|3|And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to toil thither; for they are but few.
Joshua|7|4|So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
Joshua|7|5|
Joshua|7|6|And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
Joshua|7|7|And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been content and dwelt beyond the Jordan!
Joshua|7|8|Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel hath turned their backs before their enemies!
Joshua|7|9|
Joshua|7|10|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?
Joshua|7|11|Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff.
Joshua|7|12|Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua|7|13|Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, There is a devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel; thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.
Joshua|7|14|In the morning therefore ye shall be brought near by your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come near by families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near by households; and the household which Jehovah shall take shall come near man by man.
Joshua|7|15|
Joshua|7|16|So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
Joshua|7|17|and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
Joshua|7|18|and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
Joshua|7|19|And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.
Joshua|7|20|And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
Joshua|7|21|
Joshua|7|22|So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
Joshua|7|23|And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel; and they laid them down before Jehovah.
Joshua|7|24|And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them up unto the valley of Achor.
Joshua|7|25|And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
Joshua|7|26|
Joshua|8|1|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land;
Joshua|8|2|
Joshua|8|3|So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.
Joshua|8|4|And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city; go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
Joshua|8|5|and I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them;
Joshua|8|6|and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: so we will flee before them;
Joshua|8|7|and ye shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of the city: for Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand.
Joshua|8|8|And it shall be, when ye have seized upon the city, that ye shall set the city on fire; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do: see, I have commanded you.
Joshua|8|9|
Joshua|8|10|And Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
Joshua|8|11|war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between him and Ai.
Joshua|8|12|And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
Joshua|8|13|So they set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers-in-wait that were on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
Joshua|8|14|And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed, before the Arabah; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
Joshua|8|15|And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
Joshua|8|16|And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
Joshua|8|17|
Joshua|8|18|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
Joshua|8|19|And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and set the city on fire.
Joshua|8|20|And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
Joshua|8|21|And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|22|And the others came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
Joshua|8|23|
Joshua|8|24|And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
Joshua|8|25|And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
Joshua|8|26|For Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Joshua|8|27|Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey unto themselves, according unto the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
Joshua|8|28|So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.
Joshua|8|29|
Joshua|8|30|Then Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, in mount Ebal,
Joshua|8|31|as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man had lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
Joshua|8|32|And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua|8|33|And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, as well the sojourner as the homeborn; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
Joshua|8|34|And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
Joshua|8|35|
Joshua|9|1|And it came to pass, when all the kings that were beyond the Jordan, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;
Joshua|9|2|
Joshua|9|3|But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
Joshua|9|4|they also did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-skins, old and rent and bound up,
Joshua|9|5|and old and patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy.
Joshua|9|6|And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|7|And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?
Joshua|9|8|And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?
Joshua|9|9|And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
Joshua|9|10|and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Joshua|9|11|And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: and now make ye a covenant with us.
Joshua|9|12|This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and is become mouldy:
Joshua|9|13|and these wine-skins, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
Joshua|9|14|And the men took of their provision, and asked not counsel at the mouth of Jehovah.
Joshua|9|15|
Joshua|9|16|And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
Joshua|9|17|And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua|9|18|And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
Joshua|9|19|But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by Jehovah, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
Joshua|9|20|This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
Joshua|9|21|
Joshua|9|22|And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
Joshua|9|23|Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall never fail to be of you bondmen, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
Joshua|9|24|And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
Joshua|9|25|And now, behold, we are in thy hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
Joshua|9|26|And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
Joshua|9|27|
Joshua|10|1|Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
Joshua|10|2|that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
Joshua|10|3|Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Joshua|10|4|Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
Joshua|10|5|
Joshua|10|6|And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.
Joshua|10|7|So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
Joshua|10|8|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
Joshua|10|9|he went up from Gilgal all the night.
Joshua|10|10|And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and he slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
Joshua|10|11|
Joshua|10|12|
Joshua|10|13|Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
Joshua|10|14|
Joshua|10|15|
Joshua|10|16|And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|17|And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
Joshua|10|18|And Joshua said, Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:
Joshua|10|19|but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for Jehovah your God hath delivered them into your hand.
Joshua|10|20|And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,
Joshua|10|21|
Joshua|10|22|Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave.
Joshua|10|23|And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
Joshua|10|24|And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
Joshua|10|25|And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus shall Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
Joshua|10|26|And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
Joshua|10|27|
Joshua|10|28|
Joshua|10|29|And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
Joshua|10|30|
Joshua|10|31|And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|32|
Joshua|10|33|
Joshua|10|34|And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, unto Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
Joshua|10|35|
Joshua|10|36|And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:
Joshua|10|37|
Joshua|10|38|And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:
Joshua|10|39|
Joshua|10|40|So Joshua smote all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded.
Joshua|10|41|And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
Joshua|10|42|And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
Joshua|10|43|
Joshua|11|1|And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard thereof, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
Joshua|11|2|and to the kings that were on the north, in the hill-country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
Joshua|11|3|to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua|11|4|And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
Joshua|11|5|
Joshua|11|6|And Jehovah said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hock their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
Joshua|11|7|So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
Joshua|11|8|And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.
Joshua|11|9|
Joshua|11|10|And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.
Joshua|11|11|And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was none left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
Joshua|11|12|And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded.
Joshua|11|13|But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
Joshua|11|14|And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.
Joshua|11|15|
Joshua|11|16|So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
Joshua|11|17|from mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and put them to death.
Joshua|11|18|Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
Joshua|11|19|There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: they took all in battle.
Joshua|11|20|
Joshua|11|21|And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
Joshua|11|22|There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.
Joshua|11|23|
Joshua|12|1|Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:
Joshua|12|2|the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|12|3|and the Arabah unto the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and unto the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
Joshua|12|4|and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
Joshua|12|5|and ruled in mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
Joshua|12|6|
Joshua|12|7|And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; and Joshua gave it unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
Joshua|12|8|in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Joshua|12|9|the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|10|the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua|12|11|the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
Joshua|12|12|the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
Joshua|12|13|the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
Joshua|12|14|the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
Joshua|12|15|the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
Joshua|12|16|the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
Joshua|12|17|the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua|12|18|the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
Joshua|12|19|the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua|12|20|the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua|12|21|the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua|12|22|the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua|12|23|the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua|12|24|
Joshua|13|1|Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Jehovah said unto him, Thou art old and well stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
Joshua|13|2|This is the land that yet remaineth: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
Joshua|13|3|is reckoned to the Canaanites; the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,
Joshua|13|4|on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongeth to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;
Joshua|13|5|and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entrance of Hamath;
Joshua|13|6|all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allot thou it unto Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
Joshua|13|7|
Joshua|13|8|With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them:
Joshua|13|9|from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
Joshua|13|10|and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
Joshua|13|11|and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salecah;
Joshua|13|12|all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim); for these did Moses smite, and drove them out.
Joshua|13|13|Nevertheless the children of Israel drove not out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel unto this day.
Joshua|13|14|
Joshua|13|15|And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
Joshua|13|16|And their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Joshua|13|17|Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,
Joshua|13|18|and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Joshua|13|19|and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley,
Joshua|13|20|and Beth-peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,
Joshua|13|21|and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, that dwelt in the land.
Joshua|13|22|Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain.
Joshua|13|23|
Joshua|13|24|And Moses gave unto the tribe of Gad, unto the children of Gad, according to their families.
Joshua|13|25|And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
Joshua|13|26|and from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
Joshua|13|27|, unto the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
Joshua|13|28|
Joshua|13|29|unto the half-tribe of Manasseh: and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families.
Joshua|13|30|And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:
Joshua|13|31|
Joshua|13|32|These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
Joshua|13|33|
Joshua|14|1|of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,
Joshua|14|2|by the lot of their inheritance, as Jehovah commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
Joshua|14|3|For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
Joshua|14|4|For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
Joshua|14|5|
Joshua|14|6|Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that Jehovah spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua|14|7|Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
Joshua|14|8|Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|9|And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God.
Joshua|14|10|And now, behold, Jehovah hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that Jehovah spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
Joshua|14|11|As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
Joshua|14|12|
Joshua|14|13|And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
Joshua|14|14|Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Joshua|14|15|
Joshua|15|1|And the lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was unto the border of Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.
Joshua|15|2|And their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that looketh southward;
Joshua|15|3|and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned about to Karka;
Joshua|15|4|and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea: this shall be your south border.
Joshua|15|5|And the east border was the Salt Sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan;
Joshua|15|6|and the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|15|7|and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river; and the border passed along to the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel;
Joshua|15|8|and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost part of the vale of Rephaim northward;
Joshua|15|9|and the border extended from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is Kiriath-jearim);
Joshua|15|10|and the border turned about from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;
Joshua|15|11|and the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
Joshua|15|12|
Joshua|15|13|the father of Anak (the same is Hebron).
Joshua|15|14|And Caleb drove out thence the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
Joshua|15|15|And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.
Joshua|15|16|And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|17|And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
Joshua|15|18|, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou?
Joshua|15|19|
Joshua|15|20|
Joshua|15|21|And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
Joshua|15|22|and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
Joshua|15|23|and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
Joshua|15|24|Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

Joshua|15|27|and Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-pelet,
Joshua|15|28|and Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,

Joshua|15|36|
Joshua|15|37|Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,
Joshua|15|38|and Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,
Joshua|15|39|Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,
Joshua|15|40|and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chitlish,
Joshua|15|41|
Joshua|15|42|Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
Joshua|15|43|and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
Joshua|15|44|
Joshua|15|45|Ekron, with its towns and its villages;
Joshua|15|46|
Joshua|15|47|
Joshua|15|48|And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
Joshua|15|49|and Dannah, and Kiriath-sannah (the same is Debir),
Joshua|15|50|and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
Joshua|15|51|
Joshua|15|52|Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,
Joshua|15|53|and Janim, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,
Joshua|15|54|
Joshua|15|55|Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Jutah,
Joshua|15|56|and Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,
Joshua|15|57|
Joshua|15|58|Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,
Joshua|15|59|
Joshua|15|60|
Joshua|15|61|In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
Joshua|15|62|
Joshua|15|63|
Joshua|16|1|And the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill-country to Beth-el;
Joshua|16|2|and it went out from Beth-el to Luz, and passed along unto the border of the Archites to Ataroth;
Joshua|16|3|and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, unto the border of Beth-horon the nether, even unto Gezer; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.
Joshua|16|4|
Joshua|16|5|: the border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;
Joshua|16|6|and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north; and the border turned about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah;
Joshua|16|7|and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah, and reached unto Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
Joshua|16|8|From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families;
Joshua|16|9|together with the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
Joshua|16|10|
Joshua|17|1|was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph. As for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua|17|2|was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
Joshua|17|3|But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua|17|4|And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of Jehovah he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
Joshua|17|5|And there fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;
Joshua|17|6|
Joshua|17|7|And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand, unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Joshua|17|8|The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.
Joshua|17|9|And the border went down unto the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook: these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh: and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and the goings out thereof were at the sea:
Joshua|17|10|southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.
Joshua|17|11|And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.
Joshua|17|12|those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Joshua|17|13|
Joshua|17|14|And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as hitherto Jehovah hath blessed me?
Joshua|17|15|And Joshua said unto them, If thou be a great people, get thee up to the forest, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
Joshua|17|16|And the children of Joseph said, The hill-country is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.
Joshua|17|17|And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power; thou shalt not have one lot only:
Joshua|17|18|
Joshua|18|1|And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there: and the land was subdued before them.
Joshua|18|2|And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet divided their inheritance.
Joshua|18|3|And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go in to possess the land, which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, hath given you?
Joshua|18|4|Appoint for you three men of each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come unto me.
Joshua|18|5|And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north.
Joshua|18|6|hither to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.
Joshua|18|7|
Joshua|18|8|And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh.
Joshua|18|9|And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua unto the camp at Shiloh.
Joshua|18|10|
Joshua|18|11|And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua|18|12|And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua|18|13|And the border passed along from thence to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain that lieth on the south of Beth-horon the nether.
Joshua|18|14|, and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
Joshua|18|15|And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out westward, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;
Joshua|18|16|and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the vale of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;
Joshua|18|17|and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;
Joshua|18|18|and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down unto the Arabah;
Joshua|18|19|and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border.
Joshua|18|20|
Joshua|18|21|Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,
Joshua|18|22|and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,
Joshua|18|23|and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
Joshua|18|24|and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:
Joshua|18|25|Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
Joshua|18|26|and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
Joshua|18|27|and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
Joshua|18|28|
Joshua|19|1|And the second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah.
Joshua|19|2|And they had for their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
Joshua|19|3|and Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Ezem,
Joshua|19|4|and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
Joshua|19|5|and Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
Joshua|19|6|and Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:
Joshua|19|7|Ain, Rimmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages:
Joshua|19|8|and all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
Joshua|19|9|
Joshua|19|10|And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid;
Joshua|19|11|and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;
Joshua|19|12|and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor; and it went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia;
Joshua|19|13|and from thence it passed along eastward to Gath-hepher, to Eth-kazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretcheth unto Neah;
Joshua|19|14|and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of Iphtah-el;
Joshua|19|15|and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|16|
Joshua|19|17|The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families.
Joshua|19|18|And their border was unto Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
Joshua|19|19|and Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
Joshua|19|20|and Rabbith, and Kishion, and Ebez,
Joshua|19|21|and Remeth, and Engannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez,
Joshua|19|22|and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh; and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|23|
Joshua|19|24|And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
Joshua|19|25|And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
Joshua|19|26|and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
Joshua|19|27|and it turned toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah-el northward to Beth-emek and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,
Joshua|19|28|and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Sidon;
Joshua|19|29|and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea by the region of Achzib;
Joshua|19|30|Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|31|
Joshua|19|32|The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
Joshua|19|33|And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakkum; and the goings out thereof were at the Jordan;
Joshua|19|34|and the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went out from thence to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrising.
Joshua|19|35|And the fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
Joshua|19|36|and Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
Joshua|19|37|and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,
Joshua|19|38|And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
Joshua|19|39|
Joshua|19|40|The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
Joshua|19|41|And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,
Joshua|19|42|and Shaalabbin, and Aijalon, and Ithlah,
Joshua|19|43|and Elon, and Timnah, and Ekron,
Joshua|19|44|and Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
Joshua|19|45|and Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,
Joshua|19|46|and Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa.
Joshua|19|47|And the border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
Joshua|19|48|
Joshua|19|49|So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
Joshua|19|50|
Joshua|19|51|
Joshua|20|1|And Jehovah spake unto Joshua, saying,
Joshua|20|2|Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by Moses,
Joshua|20|3|unawares may flee thither: and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.
Joshua|20|4|And he shall flee unto one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
Joshua|20|5|And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor unawares, and hated him not beforetime.
Joshua|20|6|
Joshua|20|7|And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill-country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah.
Joshua|20|8|And beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua|20|9|
Joshua|21|1|of the tribes of the children of Israel;
Joshua|21|2|and they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
Joshua|21|3|
Joshua|21|4|
Joshua|21|5|
Joshua|21|6|
Joshua|21|7|
Joshua|21|8|And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as Jehovah commanded by Moses.
Joshua|21|9|mentioned by name:
Joshua|21|10|and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
Joshua|21|11|the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill-country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
Joshua|21|12|
Joshua|21|13|And unto the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Libnah with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|14|and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|15|and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|16|Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
Joshua|21|17|And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|18|Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|19|
Joshua|21|20|And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
Joshua|21|21|And they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|22|and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|23|And out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|24|Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|25|And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
Joshua|21|26|
Joshua|21|27|Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Be-eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.
Joshua|21|28|And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|29|Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|30|And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|31|Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|32|And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
Joshua|21|33|
Joshua|21|34|And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|35|Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|36|And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|37|Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.
Joshua|21|38|And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
Joshua|21|39|Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
Joshua|21|40|
Joshua|21|41|All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
Joshua|21|42|
Joshua|21|43|So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
Joshua|21|44|And Jehovah gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
Joshua|21|45|
Joshua|22|1|Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua|22|2|and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, and have hearkened unto my voice in all that I commanded you:
Joshua|22|3|ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.
Joshua|22|4|And now Jehovah your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he spake unto them: therefore now turn ye, and get you unto your tents, unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan.
Joshua|22|5|Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, to love Jehovah your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Joshua|22|6|
Joshua|22|7|in Bashan; but unto the other half gave Joshua among their brethren beyond the Jordan westward; moreover when Joshua sent them away unto their tents, he blessed them,
Joshua|22|8|and spake unto them, saying, Return with much wealth unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
Joshua|22|9|
Joshua|22|10|And when they came unto the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.
Joshua|22|11|And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertaineth to the children of Israel.
Joshua|22|12|
Joshua|22|13|And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
Joshua|22|14|and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were every one of them head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel.
Joshua|22|15|And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
Joshua|22|16|Thus saith the whole congregation of Jehovah, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that ye have builded you an altar, to rebel this day against Jehovah?
Joshua|22|17|Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves unto this day, although there came a plague upon the congregation of Jehovah,
Joshua|22|18|that ye must turn away this day from following Jehovah? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against Jehovah, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
Joshua|22|19|Howbeit, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of Jehovah, wherein Jehovah’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
Joshua|22|20|
Joshua|22|21|Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
Joshua|22|22|The Mighty One, God, Jehovah, the Mighty One, God, Jehovah, he knoweth; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Jehovah (save thou us not this day,)
Joshua|22|23|that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Jehovah; or if to offer thereon burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Jehovah himself require it;
Joshua|22|24|of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah, the God of Israel?
Joshua|22|25|for Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no portion in Jehovah: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.
Joshua|22|26|Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
Joshua|22|27|but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.
Joshua|22|28|Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.
Joshua|22|29|
Joshua|22|30|And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them well.
Joshua|22|31|And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Jehovah is in the midst of us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
Joshua|22|32|And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
Joshua|22|33|And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spake no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
Joshua|22|34|
Joshua|23|1|And it came to pass after many days, when Jehovah had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;
Joshua|23|2|that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years:
Joshua|23|3|and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for Jehovah your God, he it is that hath fought for you.
Joshua|23|4|Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
Joshua|23|5|And Jehovah your God, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God spake unto you.
Joshua|23|6|Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;
Joshua|23|7|, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them;
Joshua|23|8|but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.
Joshua|23|9|For Jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.
Joshua|23|10|One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Jehovah your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spake unto you.
Joshua|23|11|Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love Jehovah your God.
Joshua|23|12|Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you;
Joshua|23|13|
Joshua|23|14|And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.
Joshua|23|15|And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you.
Joshua|23|16|
Joshua|24|1|And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
Joshua|24|2|And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
Joshua|24|3|And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
Joshua|24|4|And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it: and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
Joshua|24|5|And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.
Joshua|24|6|And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.
Joshua|24|7|And when they cried out unto Jehovah, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
Joshua|24|8|And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
Joshua|24|9|Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
Joshua|24|10|but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
Joshua|24|11|And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
Joshua|24|12|And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
Joshua|24|13|
Joshua|24|14|Now therefore fear Jehovah, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.
Joshua|24|15|
Joshua|24|16|And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;
Joshua|24|17|for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;
Joshua|24|18|
Joshua|24|19|And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.
Joshua|24|20|If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
Joshua|24|21|And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve Jehovah.
Joshua|24|22|And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
Joshua|24|23|, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, the God of Israel.
Joshua|24|24|And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.
Joshua|24|25|So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
Joshua|24|26|And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
Joshua|24|27|And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
Joshua|24|28|
Joshua|24|29|And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
Joshua|24|30|And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
Joshua|24|31|
Joshua|24|32|And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
Joshua|24|33|
Nahum|1|1|The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
Nahum|1|2|for his enemies.
Nahum|1|3|: Jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
Nahum|1|4|He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
Nahum|1|5|The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
Nahum|1|6|Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.
Nahum|1|7|Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.
Nahum|1|8|But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
Nahum|1|9|What do ye devise against Jehovah? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.
Nahum|1|10|For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
Nahum|1|11|There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against Jehovah, that counselleth wickedness.
Nahum|1|12|Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
Nahum|1|13|And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
Nahum|1|14|And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
Nahum|1|15|
Nahum|2|1|He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
Nahum|2|2|For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.
Nahum|2|3|are brandished.
Nahum|2|4|The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.
Nahum|2|5|He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.
Nahum|2|6|The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
Nahum|2|7|And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.
Nahum|2|8|; but none looketh back.
Nahum|2|9|Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
Nahum|2|10|She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
Nahum|2|11|the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?
Nahum|2|12|The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.
Nahum|2|13|
Nahum|3|1|Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.
Nahum|3|2|The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels, and prancing horses, and bounding chariots,
Nahum|3|3|the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies; they stumble upon their bodies;-
Nahum|3|4|because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well-favored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
Nahum|3|5|Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.
Nahum|3|6|And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing-stock.
Nahum|3|7|And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?
Nahum|3|8|her wall was of the sea?
Nahum|3|9|Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.
Nahum|3|10|Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets; and they cast lots for her honorable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
Nahum|3|11|Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a stronghold because of the enemy.
Nahum|3|12|fig-trees with the first-ripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.
Nahum|3|13|Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.
Nahum|3|14|Draw thee water for the siege; strengthen thy fortresses; go into the clay, and tread the mortar; make strong the brickkiln.
Nahum|3|15|There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall devour thee like the canker-worm: make thyself many as the canker-worm; make thyself many as the locust.
Nahum|3|16|Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the canker-worm ravageth, and fleeth away.
Nahum|3|17|Thy princes are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which encamp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.
Nahum|3|18|Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; thy nobles are at rest; thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.
Nahum|3|19|
1 Kings|1|1|Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1 Kings|1|2|Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1 Kings|1|3|So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1 Kings|1|4|
1 Kings|1|5|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1 Kings|1|6|And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.
1 Kings|1|7|And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1 Kings|1|8|But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|9|And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants:
1 Kings|1|10|
1 Kings|1|11|Then Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1 Kings|1|12|Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1 Kings|1|13|Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
1 Kings|1|14|
1 Kings|1|15|And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.
1 Kings|1|16|And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
1 Kings|1|17|, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1 Kings|1|18|And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not:
1 Kings|1|19|and he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|20|And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1 Kings|1|21|
1 Kings|1|22|And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.
1 Kings|1|23|And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1 Kings|1|24|And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1 Kings|1|25|live king Adonijah.
1 Kings|1|26|But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1 Kings|1|27|
1 Kings|1|28|Then king David answered and said, Call to me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
1 Kings|1|29|And the king sware, and said, As Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
1 Kings|1|30|verily as I sware unto thee by Jehovah, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.
1 Kings|1|31|
1 Kings|1|32|And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1 Kings|1|33|And the king said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1 Kings|1|34|live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|35|Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.
1 Kings|1|36|.
1 Kings|1|37|
1 Kings|1|38|So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings|1|39|live king Solomon.
1 Kings|1|40|
1 Kings|1|41|And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1 Kings|1|42|While he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.
1 Kings|1|43|And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king:
1 Kings|1|44|and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;
1 Kings|1|45|and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1 Kings|1|46|And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1 Kings|1|47|And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne: and the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1 Kings|1|48|
1 Kings|1|49|And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
1 Kings|1|50|And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|1|51|And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1 Kings|1|52|And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
1 Kings|1|53|
1 Kings|2|1|Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
1 Kings|2|2|I am going the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
1 Kings|2|3|his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
1 Kings|2|4|That Jehovah may establish his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
1 Kings|2|5|Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1 Kings|2|6|Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
1 Kings|2|7|But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.
1 Kings|2|8|And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
1 Kings|2|9|
1 Kings|2|10|And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings|2|11|And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1 Kings|2|12|
1 Kings|2|13|Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
1 Kings|2|14|He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
1 Kings|2|15|And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|16|And now I ask one petition of thee; deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
1 Kings|2|17|And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not say thee nay), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
1 Kings|2|18|
1 Kings|2|19|Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
1 Kings|2|20|Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.
1 Kings|2|21|And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
1 Kings|2|22|And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
1 Kings|2|23|Then king Solomon sware by Jehovah, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
1 Kings|2|24|Now therefore as Jehovah liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
1 Kings|2|25|
1 Kings|2|26|And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
1 Kings|2|27|
1 Kings|2|28|And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1 Kings|2|29|And it was told king Solomon, Joab is fled unto the Tent of Jehovah, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
1 Kings|2|30|And Benaiah came to the Tent of Jehovah, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
1 Kings|2|31|And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.
1 Kings|2|32|, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
1 Kings|2|33|So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.
1 Kings|2|34|Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings|2|35|
1 Kings|2|36|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
1 Kings|2|37|For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|38|
1 Kings|2|39|And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
1 Kings|2|40|And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
1 Kings|2|41|And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
1 Kings|2|42|And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not adjure thee by Jehovah, and protest unto thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The saying that I have heard is good.
1 Kings|2|43|Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
1 Kings|2|44|The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore Jehovah shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.
1 Kings|2|45|But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.
1 Kings|2|46|
1 Kings|3|1|And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
1 Kings|3|2|Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.
1 Kings|3|3|
1 Kings|3|4|And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1 Kings|3|5|In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
1 Kings|3|6|And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1 Kings|3|7|And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in.
1 Kings|3|8|And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1 Kings|3|9|
1 Kings|3|10|And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1 Kings|3|11|And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice;
1 Kings|3|12|behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
1 Kings|3|13|And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee, all thy days.
1 Kings|3|14|And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1 Kings|3|15|
1 Kings|3|16|Then there came two women that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
1 Kings|3|17|And the one woman said, Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1 Kings|3|18|And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
1 Kings|3|19|And this woman’s child died in the night, because she lay upon it.
1 Kings|3|20|And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1 Kings|3|21|And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.
1 Kings|3|22|
1 Kings|3|23|Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
1 Kings|3|24|And the king said, Fetch me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1 Kings|3|25|And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1 Kings|3|26|Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she said, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.
1 Kings|3|27|Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
1 Kings|3|28|
1 Kings|4|1|And king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1 Kings|4|2|And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
1 Kings|4|3|Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
1 Kings|4|4|and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
1 Kings|4|5|the king’s friend;
1 Kings|4|6|
1 Kings|4|7|And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.
1 Kings|4|8|And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;
1 Kings|4|9|Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
1 Kings|4|10|Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);
1 Kings|4|11|Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|12|Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
1 Kings|4|13|the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);
1 Kings|4|14|Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1 Kings|4|15|Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);
1 Kings|4|16|Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
1 Kings|4|17|Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1 Kings|4|18|Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;
1 Kings|4|19|
1 Kings|4|20|Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
1 Kings|4|21|And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1 Kings|4|22|And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
1 Kings|4|23|ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.
1 Kings|4|24|on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
1 Kings|4|25|And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|4|26|And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
1 Kings|4|27|And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.
1 Kings|4|28|
1 Kings|4|29|And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
1 Kings|4|30|And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1 Kings|4|31|For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about.
1 Kings|4|32|And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.
1 Kings|4|33|And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
1 Kings|4|34|
1 Kings|5|1|And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
1 Kings|5|2|And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1 Kings|5|3|Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Jehovah his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet.
1 Kings|5|4|But now Jehovah my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
1 Kings|5|5|And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for my name.
1 Kings|5|6|
1 Kings|5|7|And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Jehovah this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
1 Kings|5|8|which thou hast sent unto me: I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
1 Kings|5|9|My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1 Kings|5|10|So Hiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire.
1 Kings|5|11|And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
1 Kings|5|12|
1 Kings|5|13|And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1 Kings|5|14|And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to taskwork.
1 Kings|5|15|And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains;
1 Kings|5|16|besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1 Kings|5|17|And the king commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with wrought stone.
1 Kings|5|18|
1 Kings|6|1|And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|6|2|, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
1 Kings|6|3|ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
1 Kings|6|4|And for the house he made windows of fixed lattice-work.
1 Kings|6|5|And against the wall of the house he built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side-chambers round about.
1 Kings|6|6|should not have hold in the walls of the house.
1 Kings|6|7|And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
1 Kings|6|8|, and out of the middle into the third.
1 Kings|6|9|So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
1 Kings|6|10|
1 Kings|6|11|And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying,
1 Kings|6|12|Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute mine ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.
1 Kings|6|13|
1 Kings|6|14|So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1 Kings|6|15|And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house unto the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.
1 Kings|6|16|for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.
1 Kings|6|17|.
1 Kings|6|18|And there was cedar on the house within, carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
1 Kings|6|19|And he prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
1 Kings|6|20|twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with cedar.
1 Kings|6|21|So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
1 Kings|6|22|
1 Kings|6|23|And in the oracle he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high.
1 Kings|6|24|And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
1 Kings|6|25|And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
1 Kings|6|26|The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
1 Kings|6|27|And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
1 Kings|6|28|
1 Kings|6|29|And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without.
1 Kings|6|30|And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1 Kings|6|31|.
1 Kings|6|32|two doors of olive-wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.
1 Kings|6|33|;
1 Kings|6|34|and two doors of fir-wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
1 Kings|6|35|cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work.
1 Kings|6|36|
1 Kings|6|37|In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid, in the month Ziv.
1 Kings|6|38|
1 Kings|7|1|And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1 Kings|7|2|For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1 Kings|7|3|And it was covered with cedar above over the forty and five beams, that were upon the pillars; fifteen in a row.
1 Kings|7|4|And there were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.
1 Kings|7|5|And all the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.
1 Kings|7|6|And he made the porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.
1 Kings|7|7|And he made the porch of the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
1 Kings|7|8|
1 Kings|7|9|All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.
1 Kings|7|10|And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
1 Kings|7|11|And above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar-wood.
1 Kings|7|12|
1 Kings|7|13|And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
1 Kings|7|14|He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
1 Kings|7|15|For he fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.
1 Kings|7|16|And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
1 Kings|7|17|There were nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
1 Kings|7|18|So he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars: and so did he for the other capital.
1 Kings|7|19|And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits.
1 Kings|7|20|And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon the other capital.
1 Kings|7|21|And he set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
1 Kings|7|22|
1 Kings|7|23|And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
1 Kings|7|24|And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
1 Kings|7|25|It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1 Kings|7|26|
1 Kings|7|27|And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
1 Kings|7|28|And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;
1 Kings|7|29|and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
1 Kings|7|30|And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters: beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
1 Kings|7|31|And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.
1 Kings|7|32|And the four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
1 Kings|7|33|And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.
1 Kings|7|34|And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base: the undersetters thereof were of the base itself.
1 Kings|7|35|And in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the panels thereof were of the same.
1 Kings|7|36|And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the panels thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.
1 Kings|7|37|
1 Kings|7|38|And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and every laver was four cubits; and upon very one of the ten bases one laver.
1 Kings|7|39|
1 Kings|7|40|And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah:
1 Kings|7|41|the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
1 Kings|7|42|and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;
1 Kings|7|43|and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;
1 Kings|7|44|and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
1 Kings|7|45|and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Jehovah, were of burnished brass.
1 Kings|7|46|In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
1 Kings|7|47|
1 Kings|7|48|And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Jehovah: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold;
1 Kings|7|49|and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
1 Kings|7|50|
1 Kings|7|51|
1 Kings|8|1|of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
1 Kings|8|2|And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
1 Kings|8|3|And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1 Kings|8|4|And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
1 Kings|8|5|And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
1 Kings|8|6|And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah unto its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings|8|7|For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
1 Kings|8|8|And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
1 Kings|8|9|There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Jehovah made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings|8|10|And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
1 Kings|8|11|
1 Kings|8|12|Then spake Solomon, Jehovah hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
1 Kings|8|13|I have surely built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in for ever.
1 Kings|8|14|And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
1 Kings|8|15|And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spake with his mouth unto David thy father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
1 Kings|8|16|Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
1 Kings|8|17|Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Kings|8|18|But Jehovah said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart:
1 Kings|8|19|nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
1 Kings|8|20|And Jehovah hath established his word that he spake; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Kings|8|21|
1 Kings|8|22|And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;
1 Kings|8|23|and he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and lovingkindness with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their heart;
1 Kings|8|24|who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: yea, thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
1 Kings|8|25|Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
1 Kings|8|26|
1 Kings|8|27|But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded!
1 Kings|8|28|Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day;
1 Kings|8|29|that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof thou hast said, My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.
1 Kings|8|30|
1 Kings|8|31|swear before thine altar in this house;
1 Kings|8|32|
1 Kings|8|33|When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; if they turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house:
1 Kings|8|34|
1 Kings|8|35|When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them:
1 Kings|8|36|
1 Kings|8|37|caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;
1 Kings|8|38|by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
1 Kings|8|39|then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
1 Kings|8|40|
1 Kings|8|41|Moreover concerning the foreigner, that is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for thy name’s sake
1 Kings|8|42|(for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy mighty hand, and of thine outstretched arm); when he shall come and pray toward this house;
1 Kings|8|43|
1 Kings|8|44|If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Jehovah toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name;
1 Kings|8|45|
1 Kings|8|46|If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near;
1 Kings|8|47|yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
1 Kings|8|48|if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
1 Kings|8|49|then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause;
1 Kings|8|50|and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
1 Kings|8|51|(for they are thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
1 Kings|8|52|that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto thee.
1 Kings|8|53|
1 Kings|8|54|And it was so, that, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, he arose from before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven.
1 Kings|8|55|And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1 Kings|8|56|Blessed be Jehovah, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.
1 Kings|8|57|Jehovah our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us;
1 Kings|8|58|that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers.
1 Kings|8|59|And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before Jehovah, be nigh unto Jehovah our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
1 Kings|8|60|that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.
1 Kings|8|61|
1 Kings|8|62|And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|63|And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
1 Kings|8|64|The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
1 Kings|8|65|So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
1 Kings|8|66|
1 Kings|9|1|And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,
1 Kings|9|2|that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
1 Kings|9|3|And Jehovah said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
1 Kings|9|4|And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances;
1 Kings|9|5|then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, according as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
1 Kings|9|6|But if ye shall turn away from following me, ye or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
1 Kings|9|7|then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
1 Kings|9|8|And though this house is so high, yet shall every one that passeth by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath Jehovah done thus unto this land, and to this house?
1 Kings|9|9|
1 Kings|9|10|And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king’s house
1 Kings|9|11|(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1 Kings|9|12|And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
1 Kings|9|13|And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
1 Kings|9|14|
1 Kings|9|15|And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
1 Kings|9|16|Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
1 Kings|9|17|And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
1 Kings|9|18|and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
1 Kings|9|19|and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
1 Kings|9|20|As for all the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;
1 Kings|9|21|their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants unto this day.
1 Kings|9|22|
1 Kings|9|23|
1 Kings|9|24|
1 Kings|9|25|
1 Kings|9|26|And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1 Kings|9|27|And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
1 Kings|9|28|
1 Kings|10|1|And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to prove him with hard questions.
1 Kings|10|2|And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1 Kings|10|3|And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not.
1 Kings|10|4|And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
1 Kings|10|5|and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of Jehovah; there was no more spirit in her.
1 Kings|10|6|And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|7|Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
1 Kings|10|8|that hear thy wisdom.
1 Kings|10|9|Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because Jehovah loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do justice and righteousness.
1 Kings|10|10|
1 Kings|10|11|And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug-trees and precious stones.
1 Kings|10|12|
1 Kings|10|13|
1 Kings|10|14|Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
1 Kings|10|15|, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.
1 Kings|10|16|of gold went to one buckler.
1 Kings|10|17|three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1 Kings|10|18|Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
1 Kings|10|19|There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
1 Kings|10|20|And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1 Kings|10|21|And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1 Kings|10|22|
1 Kings|10|23|So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
1 Kings|10|24|And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1 Kings|10|25|
1 Kings|10|26|And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1 Kings|10|27|And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
1 Kings|10|28|And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
1 Kings|10|29|
1 Kings|11|1|Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
1 Kings|11|2|of the nations concerning which Jehovah said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
1 Kings|11|3|And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
1 Kings|11|4|For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of David his father.
1 Kings|11|5|For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
1 Kings|11|6|And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|7|Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
1 Kings|11|8|
1 Kings|11|9|And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice,
1 Kings|11|10|and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which Jehovah commanded.
1 Kings|11|11|Wherefore Jehovah said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
1 Kings|11|12|Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1 Kings|11|13|
1 Kings|11|14|And Jehovah raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
1 Kings|11|15|For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom
1 Kings|11|16|(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
1 Kings|11|17|that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
1 Kings|11|18|And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
1 Kings|11|19|And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
1 Kings|11|20|And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
1 Kings|11|21|And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
1 Kings|11|22|
1 Kings|11|23|adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
1 Kings|11|24|: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
1 Kings|11|25|
1 Kings|11|26|And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.
1 Kings|11|27|And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.
1 Kings|11|28|And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.
1 Kings|11|29|had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
1 Kings|11|30|And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.
1 Kings|11|31|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee
1 Kings|11|32|(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);
1 Kings|11|33|my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David his father.
1 Kings|11|34|Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
1 Kings|11|35|but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
1 Kings|11|36|And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
1 Kings|11|37|And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
1 Kings|11|38|And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
1 Kings|11|39|And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1 Kings|11|40|
1 Kings|11|41|Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1 Kings|11|42|And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1 Kings|11|43|
1 Kings|12|1|And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
1 Kings|12|2|And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,
1 Kings|12|3|and they sent and called him), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
1 Kings|12|4|Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1 Kings|12|5|
1 Kings|12|6|And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
1 Kings|12|7|And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
1 Kings|12|8|But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that were grown up with him, that stood before him.
1 Kings|12|9|And he said unto them, What counsel give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father did put upon us lighter?
1 Kings|12|10|And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
1 Kings|12|11|
1 Kings|12|12|So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1 Kings|12|13|And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
1 Kings|12|14|and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1 Kings|12|15|
1 Kings|12|16|And when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
1 Kings|12|17|But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1 Kings|12|18|Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to taskwork; and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1 Kings|12|19|So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1 Kings|12|20|
1 Kings|12|21|And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1 Kings|12|22|But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1 Kings|12|23|Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
1 Kings|12|24|
1 Kings|12|25|Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill-country of Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.
1 Kings|12|26|And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of David:
1 Kings|12|27|if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
1 Kings|12|28|Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and he said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings|12|29|And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.
1 Kings|12|30|before the one, even unto Dan.
1 Kings|12|31|And he made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, that were not of the sons of Levi.
1 Kings|12|32|And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he went up unto the altar; so did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places that he had made.
1 Kings|12|33|
1 Kings|13|1|And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of Jehovah unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings|13|2|And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.
1 Kings|13|3|And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Jehovah hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
1 Kings|13|4|And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.
1 Kings|13|5|The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|13|6|And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the favor of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
1 Kings|13|7|And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
1 Kings|13|8|And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
1 Kings|13|9|for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.
1 Kings|13|10|
1 Kings|13|11|Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.
1 Kings|13|12|And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of God went, that came from Judah.
1 Kings|13|13|And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.
1 Kings|13|14|And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
1 Kings|13|15|Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1 Kings|13|16|And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
1 Kings|13|17|for it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
1 Kings|13|18|he lied unto him.
1 Kings|13|19|
1 Kings|13|20|And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came unto the prophet that brought him back;
1 Kings|13|21|and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah, and hast not kept the commandment which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
1 Kings|13|22|but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
1 Kings|13|23|, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
1 Kings|13|24|And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.
1 Kings|13|25|
1 Kings|13|26|And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the mouth of Jehovah: therefore Jehovah hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake unto him.
1 Kings|13|27|And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled it.
1 Kings|13|28|And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.
1 Kings|13|29|And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
1 Kings|13|30|, Alas, my brother!
1 Kings|13|31|And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
1 Kings|13|32|
1 Kings|13|33|After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
1 Kings|13|34|
1 Kings|14|1|At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1 Kings|14|2|And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who spake concerning me that I should be king over this people.
1 Kings|14|3|And take with thee ten loaves, and cakes, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.
1 Kings|14|4|And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
1 Kings|14|5|
1 Kings|14|6|And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1 Kings|14|7|Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
1 Kings|14|8|and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee; and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes,
1 Kings|14|9|but hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
1 Kings|14|10|therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child, him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone.
1 Kings|14|11|Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah hath spoken it.
1 Kings|14|12|when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
1 Kings|14|13|And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
1 Kings|14|14|Moreover Jehovah will raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
1 Kings|14|15|For Jehovah will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Jehovah to anger.
1 Kings|14|16|
1 Kings|14|17|as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
1 Kings|14|18|
1 Kings|14|19|And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1 Kings|14|20|
1 Kings|14|21|And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
1 Kings|14|22|And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.
1 Kings|14|23|For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;
1 Kings|14|24|
1 Kings|14|25|And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
1 Kings|14|26|and he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
1 Kings|14|27|And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.
1 Kings|14|28|
1 Kings|14|29|Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings|14|30|And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1 Kings|14|31|
1 Kings|15|1|Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.
1 Kings|15|2|Three years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings|15|3|And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.
1 Kings|15|4|Nevertheless for David’s sake did Jehovah his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem;
1 Kings|15|5|because David did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
1 Kings|15|6|
1 Kings|15|7|And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1 Kings|15|8|
1 Kings|15|9|And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.
1 Kings|15|10|And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
1 Kings|15|11|And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did David his father.
1 Kings|15|12|And he put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
1 Kings|15|13|And also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
1 Kings|15|14|But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
1 Kings|15|15|
1 Kings|15|16|And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1 Kings|15|17|And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1 Kings|15|18|Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
1 Kings|15|19|a league between me and thee, between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1 Kings|15|20|And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
1 Kings|15|21|And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
1 Kings|15|22|
1 Kings|15|23|Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1 Kings|15|24|
1 Kings|15|25|And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel two years.
1 Kings|15|26|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|15|27|And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
1 Kings|15|28|Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|15|29|And it came to pass that, as soon as he was king, he smote all the house of Jeroboam: he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him; according unto the saying of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
1 Kings|15|30|
1 Kings|15|31|Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|15|32|
1 Kings|15|33|twenty and four years.
1 Kings|15|34|
1 Kings|16|1|And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
1 Kings|16|2|Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1 Kings|16|3|behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house; and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1 Kings|16|4|
1 Kings|16|5|Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|6|And Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|7|
1 Kings|16|8|two years.
1 Kings|16|9|And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
1 Kings|16|10|and Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1 Kings|16|11|And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha: he left him not a single man-child, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
1 Kings|16|12|Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
1 Kings|16|13|for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|14|
1 Kings|16|15|In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1 Kings|16|16|And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also smitten the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1 Kings|16|17|And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|18|And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
1 Kings|16|19|for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
1 Kings|16|20|
1 Kings|16|21|Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1 Kings|16|22|But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1 Kings|16|23|twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
1 Kings|16|24|And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
1 Kings|16|25|And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and dealt wickedly above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|26|For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
1 Kings|16|27|Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|16|28|
1 Kings|16|29|And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
1 Kings|16|30|And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah above all that were before him.
1 Kings|16|31|And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
1 Kings|16|32|And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1 Kings|16|33|And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
1 Kings|16|34|
1 Kings|17|1|And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
1 Kings|17|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|3|Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|4|And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1 Kings|17|5|So he went and did according unto the word of Jehovah; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
1 Kings|17|6|And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
1 Kings|17|7|
1 Kings|17|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying,
1 Kings|17|9|Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.
1 Kings|17|10|So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1 Kings|17|11|And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
1 Kings|17|12|And she said, As Jehovah thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
1 Kings|17|13|And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
1 Kings|17|14|For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|17|15|days.
1 Kings|17|16|
1 Kings|17|17|And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
1 Kings|17|18|And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!
1 Kings|17|19|And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
1 Kings|17|20|And he cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
1 Kings|17|21|And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto Jehovah, and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.
1 Kings|17|22|And Jehovah hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
1 Kings|17|23|And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
1 Kings|17|24|
1 Kings|18|1|And it came to pass after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
1 Kings|18|2|And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And the famine was sore in Samaria.
1 Kings|18|3|And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly:
1 Kings|18|4|for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
1 Kings|18|5|And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land, unto all the fountains of water, and unto all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
1 Kings|18|6|
1 Kings|18|7|And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Is it thou, my lord Elijah?
1 Kings|18|8|.
1 Kings|18|9|And he said, Wherein have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
1 Kings|18|10|As Jehovah thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
1 Kings|18|11|.
1 Kings|18|12|And it will come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth.
1 Kings|18|13|Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
1 Kings|18|14|; and he will slay me.
1 Kings|18|15|
1 Kings|18|16|So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings|18|17|And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Is it thou, thou troubler of Israel?
1 Kings|18|18|And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah, and thou hast followed the Baalim.
1 Kings|18|19|
1 Kings|18|20|So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
1 Kings|18|21|And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long go ye limping between the two sides? if Jehovah be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
1 Kings|18|22|Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
1 Kings|18|23|Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|24|
1 Kings|18|25|And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under.
1 Kings|18|26|And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped about the altar which was made.
1 Kings|18|27|And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for he is a god: either he is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked.
1 Kings|18|28|And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them.
1 Kings|18|29|
1 Kings|18|30|And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me; and all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was thrown down.
1 Kings|18|31|And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of Jehovah came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
1 Kings|18|32|And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
1 Kings|18|33|And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt-offering, and on the wood.
1 Kings|18|34|And he said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
1 Kings|18|35|And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1 Kings|18|36|oblation, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
1 Kings|18|37|thou hast turned their heart back again.
1 Kings|18|38|Then the fire of Jehovah fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
1 Kings|18|39|And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah, he is God.
1 Kings|18|40|
1 Kings|18|41|And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
1 Kings|18|42|So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
1 Kings|18|43|And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
1 Kings|18|44|, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
1 Kings|18|45|And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:
1 Kings|18|46|
1 Kings|19|1|And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
1 Kings|19|2|Then Jezebel send a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.
1 Kings|19|3|And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
1 Kings|19|4|But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Jehovah, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
1 Kings|19|5|And he lay down and slept under a juniper-tree; and, behold, an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
1 Kings|19|6|And he looked, and, behold, there was at his head a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
1 Kings|19|7|And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.
1 Kings|19|8|
1 Kings|19|9|And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of Jehovah came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1 Kings|19|10|And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
1 Kings|19|11|And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And, behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; but Jehovah was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Jehovah was not in the earthquake:
1 Kings|19|12|and after the earthquake a fire; but Jehovah was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
1 Kings|19|13|And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1 Kings|19|14|
1 Kings|19|15|And Jehovah said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;
1 Kings|19|16|and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
1 Kings|19|17|And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
1 Kings|19|18|seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
1 Kings|19|19|before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over unto him, and cast his mantle upon him.
1 Kings|19|20|And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?
1 Kings|19|21|
1 Kings|20|1|And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
1 Kings|20|2|And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
1 Kings|20|3|Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
1 Kings|20|4|And the king of Israel answered and said, It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have.
1 Kings|20|5|And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, I sent indeed unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
1 Kings|20|6|
1 Kings|20|7|Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
1 Kings|20|8|And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken thou not, neither consent.
1 Kings|20|9|Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
1 Kings|20|10|And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
1 Kings|20|11|boast himself as he that putteth it off.
1 Kings|20|12|
1 Kings|20|13|And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
1 Kings|20|14|And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, By the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, Thou.
1 Kings|20|15|
1 Kings|20|16|And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
1 Kings|20|17|And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out from Samaria.
1 Kings|20|18|And he said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.
1 Kings|20|19|So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
1 Kings|20|20|And they slew every one his man; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
1 Kings|20|21|
1 Kings|20|22|And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1 Kings|20|23|And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1 Kings|20|24|And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their room;
1 Kings|20|25|
1 Kings|20|26|And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
1 Kings|20|27|And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
1 Kings|20|28|And a man of God came near and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
1 Kings|20|29|And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
1 Kings|20|30|
1 Kings|20|31|And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
1 Kings|20|32|ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
1 Kings|20|33|Now the men observed diligently, and hasted to catch whether it were his mind; and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
1 Kings|20|34|
1 Kings|20|35|And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of Jehovah, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
1 Kings|20|36|Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
1 Kings|20|37|Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.
1 Kings|20|38|So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
1 Kings|20|39|And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
1 Kings|20|40|And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
1 Kings|20|41|And he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
1 Kings|20|42|And he said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
1 Kings|20|43|
1 Kings|21|1|And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1 Kings|21|2|And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
1 Kings|21|3|And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
1 Kings|21|4|
1 Kings|21|5|But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
1 Kings|21|6|vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
1 Kings|21|7|And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1 Kings|21|8|that dwelt with Naboth.
1 Kings|21|9|And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
1 Kings|21|10|
1 Kings|21|11|And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
1 Kings|21|12|They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1 Kings|21|13|And the two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bare witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.
1 Kings|21|14|Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
1 Kings|21|15|And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
1 Kings|21|16|
1 Kings|21|17|And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings|21|18|Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
1 Kings|21|19|And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, Hast thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
1 Kings|21|20|And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee, because thou hast sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah.
1 Kings|21|21|Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel:
1 Kings|21|22|and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|21|23|And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
1 Kings|21|24|Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
1 Kings|21|25|(But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
1 Kings|21|26|
1 Kings|21|27|And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1 Kings|21|28|And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1 Kings|21|29|
1 Kings|22|1|And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings|22|2|And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|3|And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1 Kings|22|4|
1 Kings|22|5|And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.
1 Kings|22|6|Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|7|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?
1 Kings|22|8|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, Micaiah the son of Imlah: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
1 Kings|22|9|Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.
1 Kings|22|10|Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
1 Kings|22|11|And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
1 Kings|22|12|
1 Kings|22|13|good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.
1 Kings|22|14|And Micaiah said, As Jehovah liveth, what Jehovah saith unto me, that will I speak.
1 Kings|22|15|And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper; and Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1 Kings|22|16|And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
1 Kings|22|17|And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Jehovah said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
1 Kings|22|18|And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
1 Kings|22|19|said, Therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
1 Kings|22|20|And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner; and another said on that manner.
1 Kings|22|21|And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
1 Kings|22|22|And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
1 Kings|22|23|
1 Kings|22|24|Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak unto thee?
1 Kings|22|25|And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1 Kings|22|26|And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;
1 Kings|22|27|and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
1 Kings|22|28|
1 Kings|22|29|So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1 Kings|22|30|And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1 Kings|22|31|Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty and two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|32|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
1 Kings|22|33|And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1 Kings|22|34|And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
1 Kings|22|35|And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
1 Kings|22|36|
1 Kings|22|37|So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings|22|38|); according unto the word of Jehovah which he spake.
1 Kings|22|39|Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings|22|40|
1 Kings|22|41|And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1 Kings|22|42|Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1 Kings|22|43|And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah: howbeit the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1 Kings|22|44|
1 Kings|22|45|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings|22|46|And the remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.
1 Kings|22|47|And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1 Kings|22|48|Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
1 Kings|22|49|Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1 Kings|22|50|
1 Kings|22|51|Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.
1 Kings|22|52|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherein he made Israel to sin.
1 Kings|22|53|
Hebrews|1|1|God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,
Hebrews|1|2|Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;
Hebrews|1|3|who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
Hebrews|1|4|having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
Hebrews|1|5|
Hebrews|1|6|And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

Hebrews|2|3|how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;
Hebrews|2|4|God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.
Hebrews|2|5|For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.
Hebrews|2|6|
Hebrews|2|7|
Hebrews|2|8|For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.
Hebrews|2|9|.
Hebrews|2|10|For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Hebrews|2|11|For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews|2|12|
Hebrews|2|13|And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.
Hebrews|2|14|Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
Hebrews|2|15|and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews|2|16|For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews|2|17|Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews|2|18|
Hebrews|3|1|Jesus;
Hebrews|3|2|who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.
Hebrews|3|3|For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
Hebrews|3|4|For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.
Hebrews|3|5|And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;
Hebrews|3|6|but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
Hebrews|3|7|
Hebrews|3|8|
Hebrews|3|9|
Hebrews|3|10|
Hebrews|3|11|
Hebrews|3|12|Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:
Hebrews|3|13|but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:
Hebrews|3|14|for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:
Hebrews|3|15|
Hebrews|3|16|For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?
Hebrews|3|17|And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews|3|18|And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?
Hebrews|3|19|
Hebrews|4|1|Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.
Hebrews|4|2|For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.
Hebrews|4|3|although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews|4|4|on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;
Hebrews|4|5|
Hebrews|4|6|Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,
Hebrews|4|7|
Hebrews|4|8|For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.
Hebrews|4|9|There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews|4|10|For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
Hebrews|4|11|Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.
Hebrews|4|12|For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews|4|13|And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews|4|14|Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
Hebrews|4|15|without sin.
Hebrews|4|16|
Hebrews|5|1|For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Hebrews|5|2|who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;
Hebrews|5|3|and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
Hebrews|5|4|And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.
Hebrews|5|5|
Hebrews|5|6|
Hebrews|5|7|Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,
Hebrews|5|8|though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;
Hebrews|5|9|and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;
Hebrews|5|10|named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|5|11|Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.
Hebrews|5|12|For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.
Hebrews|5|13|For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.
Hebrews|5|14|
Hebrews|6|1|Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Hebrews|6|2|of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
Hebrews|6|3|And this will we do, if God permit.
Hebrews|6|4|For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
Hebrews|6|5|and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews|6|6|fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.
Hebrews|6|7|For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:
Hebrews|6|8|but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.
Hebrews|6|9|But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:
Hebrews|6|10|for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.
Hebrews|6|11|And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:
Hebrews|6|12|that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
Hebrews|6|13|For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,
Hebrews|6|14|saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
Hebrews|6|15|And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews|6|16|For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.
Hebrews|6|17|Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;
Hebrews|6|18|that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:
Hebrews|6|19|both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
Hebrews|6|20|
Hebrews|7|1|For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
Hebrews|7|2|to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;
Hebrews|7|3|without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.
Hebrews|7|4|Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.
Hebrews|7|5|And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:
Hebrews|7|6|but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.
Hebrews|7|7|But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.
Hebrews|7|8|And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
Hebrews|7|9|And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;
Hebrews|7|10|for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews|7|11|that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews|7|12|For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
Hebrews|7|13|For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.
Hebrews|7|14|For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.
Hebrews|7|15|is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,
Hebrews|7|16|who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
Hebrews|7|17|
Hebrews|7|18|For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
Hebrews|7|19|(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.
Hebrews|7|20|not without the taking of an oath
Hebrews|7|21|
Hebrews|7|22|by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
Hebrews|7|23|And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:
Hebrews|7|24|but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.
Hebrews|7|25|Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
Hebrews|7|26|For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
Hebrews|7|27|of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
Hebrews|7|28|
Hebrews|8|1|: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
Hebrews|8|2|a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
Hebrews|8|3|also have somewhat to offer.
Hebrews|8|4|Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;
Hebrews|8|5|when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.
Hebrews|8|6|But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.
Hebrews|8|7|had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.
Hebrews|8|8|
Hebrews|8|9|
Hebrews|8|10|
Hebrews|8|11|
Hebrews|8|12|
Hebrews|8|13|
Hebrews|9|1|of this world.
Hebrews|9|2|the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.
Hebrews|9|3|And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;
Hebrews|9|4|a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews|9|5|and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.
Hebrews|9|6|Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;
Hebrews|9|7|but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:
Hebrews|9|8|the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;
Hebrews|9|9|a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,
Hebrews|9|10|only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
Hebrews|9|11|But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
Hebrews|9|12|nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.
Hebrews|9|13|For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:
Hebrews|9|14|how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews|9|15|And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews|9|16|For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.
Hebrews|9|17|For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.
Hebrews|9|18|hath not been dedicated without blood.
Hebrews|9|19|For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
Hebrews|9|20|saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.
Hebrews|9|21|Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.
Hebrews|9|22|And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
Hebrews|9|23|It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews|9|24|For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:
Hebrews|9|25|nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;
Hebrews|9|26|else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews|9|27|judgment;
Hebrews|9|28|
Hebrews|10|1|to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.
Hebrews|10|2|Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.
Hebrews|10|3|there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.
Hebrews|10|4|For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.
Hebrews|10|5|
Hebrews|10|6|
Hebrews|10|7|
Hebrews|10|8|for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),
Hebrews|10|9|then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
Hebrews|10|10|By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews|10|11|And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:
Hebrews|10|12|but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
Hebrews|10|13|henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.
Hebrews|10|14|For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews|10|15|
Hebrews|10|16|
Hebrews|10|17|
Hebrews|10|18|Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
Hebrews|10|19|Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews|10|20|by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
Hebrews|10|21|a great priest over the house of God;
Hebrews|10|22|let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,
Hebrews|10|23|let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:
Hebrews|10|24|and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;
Hebrews|10|25|; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.
Hebrews|10|26|For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews|10|27|but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.
Hebrews|10|28|two or three witnesses:
Hebrews|10|29|of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews|10|30|For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
Hebrews|10|31|It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews|10|32|But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews|10|33|partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.
Hebrews|10|34|For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of you possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
Hebrews|10|35|Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.
Hebrews|10|36|
Hebrews|10|37|
Hebrews|10|38|
Hebrews|10|39|
Hebrews|11|1|hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.
Hebrews|11|2|For therein the elders had witness borne to them.
Hebrews|11|3|By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.
Hebrews|11|4|By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.
Hebrews|11|5|By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:
Hebrews|11|6|he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.
Hebrews|11|7|concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
Hebrews|11|8|By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
Hebrews|11|9|not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
Hebrews|11|10|for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
Hebrews|11|11|By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:
Hebrews|11|12|as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.
Hebrews|11|13|These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
Hebrews|11|14|For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.
Hebrews|11|15|from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
Hebrews|11|16|, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.
Hebrews|11|17|;
Hebrews|11|18|even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews|11|19|able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.
Hebrews|11|20|By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
Hebrews|11|21|upon the top of his staff.
Hebrews|11|22|By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
Hebrews|11|23|By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
Hebrews|11|24|By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
Hebrews|11|25|choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
Hebrews|11|26|accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.
Hebrews|11|27|By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
Hebrews|11|28|By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
Hebrews|11|29|By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.
Hebrews|11|30|By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.
Hebrews|11|31|By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
Hebrews|11|32|And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:
Hebrews|11|33|who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews|11|34|quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.
Hebrews|11|35|Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
Hebrews|11|36|and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
Hebrews|11|37|they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
Hebrews|11|38|(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.
Hebrews|11|39|And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,
Hebrews|11|40|
Hebrews|12|1|Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
Hebrews|12|2|faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews|12|3|For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.
Hebrews|12|4|Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:
Hebrews|12|5|
Hebrews|12|6|
Hebrews|12|7|father chasteneth not?
Hebrews|12|8|But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Hebrews|12|9|Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
Hebrews|12|10|may be partakers of his holiness.
Hebrews|12|11|of righteousness.
Hebrews|12|12|Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;
Hebrews|12|13|and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
Hebrews|12|14|Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:
Hebrews|12|15|, and thereby the many be defiled;
Hebrews|12|16|any fornication, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.
Hebrews|12|17|though he sought it diligently with tears.
Hebrews|12|18|that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
Hebrews|12|19|they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;
Hebrews|12|20|for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
Hebrews|12|21|Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:
Hebrews|12|22|but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
Hebrews|12|23|to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
Hebrews|12|24|Abel.
Hebrews|12|25|from heaven:
Hebrews|12|26|whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.
Hebrews|12|27|, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
Hebrews|12|28|Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:
Hebrews|12|29|
Hebrews|13|1|Let love of the brethren continue.
Hebrews|13|2|Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
Hebrews|13|3|Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are illtreated, as being yourselves also in the body.
Hebrews|13|4|undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews|13|5|Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.
Hebrews|13|6|
Hebrews|13|7|Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.
Hebrews|13|8|and for ever.
Hebrews|13|9|Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.
Hebrews|13|10|We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.
Hebrews|13|11|for sin, are burned without the camp.
Hebrews|13|12|Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.
Hebrews|13|13|Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
Hebrews|13|14|which is to come.
Hebrews|13|15|Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.
Hebrews|13|16|But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews|13|17|unprofitable for you.
Hebrews|13|18|Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
Hebrews|13|19|the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Hebrews|13|20|our Lord Jesus,
Hebrews|13|21|the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews|13|22|But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written unto you in few words.
Hebrews|13|23|Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
Hebrews|13|24|Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
Hebrews|13|25|
1 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
1 Thessalonians|1|2|in our prayers;
1 Thessalonians|1|3|remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
1 Thessalonians|1|4|knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,
1 Thessalonians|1|5|much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.
1 Thessalonians|1|6|And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|1|7|so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
1 Thessalonians|1|8|For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.
1 Thessalonians|1|9|For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,
1 Thessalonians|1|10|
1 Thessalonians|2|1|For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:
1 Thessalonians|2|2|but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God in much conflict.
1 Thessalonians|2|3|not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
1 Thessalonians|2|4|but even as we have been approved of God to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God who proveth our hearts.
1 Thessalonians|2|5|For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness;
1 Thessalonians|2|6|nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians|2|7|But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children:
1 Thessalonians|2|8|even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.
1 Thessalonians|2|9|For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
1 Thessalonians|2|10|, how holily and righteously and unblameably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe:
1 Thessalonians|2|11|, and testifying,
1 Thessalonians|2|12|to the end that ye should walk worthily of God, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians|2|13|the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe.
1 Thessalonians|2|14|For ye, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;
1 Thessalonians|2|15|who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all men;
1 Thessalonians|2|16|forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1 Thessalonians|2|17|But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire:
1 Thessalonians|2|18|because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.
1 Thessalonians|2|19|For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
1 Thessalonians|2|20|
1 Thessalonians|3|1|Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;
1 Thessalonians|3|2|concerning your faith;
1 Thessalonians|3|3|that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.
1 Thessalonians|3|4|For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
1 Thessalonians|3|5|For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
1 Thessalonians|3|6|you;
1 Thessalonians|3|7|for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith:
1 Thessalonians|3|8|for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians|3|9|For what thanksgiving can we render again unto God for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
1 Thessalonians|3|10|night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians|3|11|Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way unto you:
1 Thessalonians|3|12|toward you;
1 Thessalonians|3|13|
1 Thessalonians|4|1|Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, even as ye do walk, --that ye abound more and more.
1 Thessalonians|4|2|For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians|4|3|your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;
1 Thessalonians|4|4|that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
1 Thessalonians|4|5|not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;
1 Thessalonians|4|6|that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
1 Thessalonians|4|7|For God called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
1 Thessalonians|4|8|Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you.
1 Thessalonians|4|9|But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
1 Thessalonians|4|10|for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more;
1 Thessalonians|4|11|and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;
1 Thessalonians|4|12|that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
1 Thessalonians|4|13|But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.
1 Thessalonians|4|14|For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
1 Thessalonians|4|15|For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians|4|16|For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
1 Thessalonians|4|17|then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians|4|18|
1 Thessalonians|5|1|But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.
1 Thessalonians|5|2|For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|3|When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.
1 Thessalonians|5|4|But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:
1 Thessalonians|5|5|for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;
1 Thessalonians|5|6|so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.
1 Thessalonians|5|7|For they that sleep sleep in the night: and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians|5|8|But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians|5|9|For God appointed us not into wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians|5|10|who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1 Thessalonians|5|11|Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.
1 Thessalonians|5|12|But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
1 Thessalonians|5|13|and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians|5|14|And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|15|See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.
1 Thessalonians|5|16|Rejoice always;
1 Thessalonians|5|17|pray without ceasing;
1 Thessalonians|5|18|in everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus to you-ward.
1 Thessalonians|5|19|Quench not the Spirit;
1 Thessalonians|5|20|despise not prophesyings;
1 Thessalonians|5|21|prove all things; hold fast that which is good;
1 Thessalonians|5|22|abstain from every form of evil.
1 Thessalonians|5|23|And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians|5|24|Faithful is he that calleth you, who will also do it.
1 Thessalonians|5|25|Brethren, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians|5|26|Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians|5|27|I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.
1 Thessalonians|5|28|
Romans|1|1|an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Romans|1|2|which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
Romans|1|3|concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans|1|4|Jesus Christ our Lord,
Romans|1|5|through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake;
Romans|1|6|Jesus Christ’s:
Romans|1|7|saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|1|8|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
Romans|1|9|For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers
Romans|1|10|making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of God to come unto you.
Romans|1|11|For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
Romans|1|12|that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
Romans|1|13|And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans|1|14|I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
Romans|1|15|So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are in Rome.
Romans|1|16|For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
Romans|1|17|For therein is revealed a righteousness of God from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.
Romans|1|18|For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness;
Romans|1|19|because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them.
Romans|1|20|his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse:
Romans|1|21|because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
Romans|1|22|Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
Romans|1|23|and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
Romans|1|24|Wherefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves:
Romans|1|25|for that they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|1|26|For this cause God gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature:
Romans|1|27|and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.
Romans|1|28|knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
Romans|1|29|being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
Romans|1|30|backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Romans|1|31|without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:
Romans|1|32|
Romans|2|1|Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judges another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.
Romans|2|2|And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.
Romans|2|3|And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
Romans|2|4|Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
Romans|2|5|but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
Romans|2|6|who will render to every man according to his works:
Romans|2|7|to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:
Romans|2|8|wrath and indignation,
Romans|2|9|tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;
Romans|2|10|but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:
Romans|2|11|for there is no respect of persons with God.
Romans|2|12|For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;
Romans|2|13|for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:
Romans|2|14|(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;
Romans|2|15|);
Romans|2|16|in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.
Romans|2|17|But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,
Romans|2|18|and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
Romans|2|19|and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,
Romans|2|20|a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;
Romans|2|21|thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
Romans|2|22|thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?
Romans|2|23|thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?
Romans|2|24|For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.
Romans|2|25|For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
Romans|2|26|If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?
Romans|2|27|and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?
Romans|2|28|For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
Romans|2|29|
Romans|3|1|What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?
Romans|3|2|Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.
Romans|3|3|For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?
Romans|3|4|
Romans|3|5|But if our righteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)
Romans|3|6|God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
Romans|3|7|But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
Romans|3|8|and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.
Romans|3|9|What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;
Romans|3|10|
Romans|3|11|
Romans|3|12|
Romans|3|13|
Romans|3|14|
Romans|3|15|
Romans|3|16|
Romans|3|17|
Romans|3|18|
Romans|3|19|Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:
Romans|3|20|the knowledge of sin.
Romans|3|21|But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
Romans|3|22|even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;
Romans|3|23|for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;
Romans|3|24|being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Romans|3|25|a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;
Romans|3|26|, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.
Romans|3|27|Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.
Romans|3|28|We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans|3|29|of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:
Romans|3|30|if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.
Romans|3|31|
Romans|4|1|What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?
Romans|4|2|For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.
Romans|4|3|For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Romans|4|4|Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.
Romans|4|5|But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
Romans|4|6|Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,
Romans|4|7|
Romans|4|8|
Romans|4|9|Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.
Romans|4|10|How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:
Romans|4|11|and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;
Romans|4|12|and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.
Romans|4|13|For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans|4|14|For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:
Romans|4|15|for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
Romans|4|16|according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
Romans|4|17|God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.
Romans|4|18|Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.
Romans|4|19|And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
Romans|4|20|yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,
Romans|4|21|and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
Romans|4|22|Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Romans|4|23|Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;
Romans|4|24|but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Romans|4|25|
Romans|5|1|Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
Romans|5|2|through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
Romans|5|3|And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;
Romans|5|4|and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:
Romans|5|5|and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.
Romans|5|6|For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans|5|7|For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.
Romans|5|8|But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans|5|9|through him.
Romans|5|10|For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;
Romans|5|11|and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Romans|5|12|Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:--
Romans|5|13|for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
Romans|5|14|Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.
Romans|5|15|the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.
Romans|5|16|of many trespasses unto justification.
Romans|5|17|Jesus Christ.
Romans|5|18|unto all men to justification of life.
Romans|5|19|For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.
Romans|5|20|And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:
Romans|5|21|
Romans|6|1|What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
Romans|6|2|God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?
Romans|6|3|Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans|6|4|We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.
Romans|6|5|of his resurrection;
Romans|6|6|, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;
Romans|6|7|for he that hath died is justified from sin.
Romans|6|8|But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;
Romans|6|9|knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.
Romans|6|10|For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
Romans|6|11|Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.
Romans|6|12|Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:
Romans|6|13|instruments of righteousness unto God.
Romans|6|14|For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
Romans|6|15|What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.
Romans|6|16|servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
Romans|6|17|But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;
Romans|6|18|and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.
Romans|6|19|servants to righteousness unto sanctification.
Romans|6|20|For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.
Romans|6|21|What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
Romans|6|22|But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
Romans|6|23|
Romans|7|1|Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?
Romans|7|2|For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
Romans|7|3|So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.
Romans|7|4|to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.
Romans|7|5|For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
Romans|7|6|But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
Romans|7|7|What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:
Romans|7|8|dead.
Romans|7|9|And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;
Romans|7|10|unto death:
Romans|7|11|for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.
Romans|7|12|So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
Romans|7|13|Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; --that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
Romans|7|14|For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
Romans|7|15|For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.
Romans|7|16|But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.
Romans|7|17|So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|18|not.
Romans|7|19|For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.
Romans|7|20|But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
Romans|7|21|I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.
Romans|7|22|For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
Romans|7|23|but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
Romans|7|24|Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?
Romans|7|25|
Romans|8|1|There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
Romans|8|2|For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.
Romans|8|3|For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
Romans|8|4|that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
Romans|8|5|For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
Romans|8|6|For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:
Romans|8|7|because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:
Romans|8|8|and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans|8|9|But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
Romans|8|10|And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans|8|11|But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
Romans|8|12|So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:
Romans|8|13|for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
Romans|8|14|For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
Romans|8|15|For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
Romans|8|16|The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:
Romans|8|17|.
Romans|8|18|For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.
Romans|8|19|For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.
Romans|8|20|For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope
Romans|8|21|that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
Romans|8|22|For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
Romans|8|23|, the redemption of our body.
Romans|8|24|For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?
Romans|8|25|do we with patience wait for it.
Romans|8|26|with groanings which cannot be uttered;
Romans|8|27|God.
Romans|8|28|purpose.
Romans|8|29|conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:
Romans|8|30|and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
Romans|8|31|against us?
Romans|8|32|He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
Romans|8|33|Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;
Romans|8|34|who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
Romans|8|35|Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
Romans|8|36|Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Romans|8|37|Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Romans|8|38|For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
Romans|8|39|
Romans|9|1|I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
Romans|9|2|that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans|9|3|For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Romans|9|4|, and the promises;
Romans|9|5|whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
Romans|9|6|not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:
Romans|9|7|neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Romans|9|8|That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.
Romans|9|9|For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
Romans|9|10|by our father Isaac--
Romans|9|11|being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,
Romans|9|12|it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
Romans|9|13|Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.
Romans|9|14|What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
Romans|9|15|For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
Romans|9|16|So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.
Romans|9|17|For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.
Romans|9|18|So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth.
Romans|9|19|Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?
Romans|9|20|Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?
Romans|9|21|Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?
Romans|9|22|What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:
Romans|9|23|and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,
Romans|9|24|us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?
Romans|9|25|
Romans|9|26|
Romans|9|27|And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:
Romans|9|28|word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.
Romans|9|29|
Romans|9|30|What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:
Romans|9|31|law.
Romans|9|32|not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;
Romans|9|33|
Romans|10|1|Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.
Romans|10|2|For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
Romans|10|3|For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Romans|10|4|For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.
Romans|10|5|For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.
Romans|10|6|But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)
Romans|10|7|or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)
Romans|10|8|But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:
Romans|10|9|Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:
Romans|10|10|for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Romans|10|11|For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
Romans|10|12|is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:
Romans|10|13|for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Romans|10|14|How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
Romans|10|15|and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!
Romans|10|16|But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
Romans|10|17|of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
Romans|10|18|
Romans|10|19|
Romans|10|20|
Romans|10|21|
Romans|11|1|I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans|11|2|God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:
Romans|11|3|Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
Romans|11|4|But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
Romans|11|5|Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
Romans|11|6|But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
Romans|11|7|What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:
Romans|11|8|according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.
Romans|11|9|
Romans|11|10|
Romans|11|11|unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
Romans|11|12|Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
Romans|11|13|But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
Romans|11|14|my flesh, and may save some of them.
Romans|11|15|, but life from the dead?
Romans|11|16|And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans|11|17|But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;
Romans|11|18|glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.
Romans|11|19|Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Romans|11|20|Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
Romans|11|21|for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
Romans|11|22|Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
Romans|11|23|And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans|11|24|, be grafted into their own olive tree?
Romans|11|25|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;
Romans|11|26|
Romans|11|27|
Romans|11|28|As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
Romans|11|29|For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.
Romans|11|30|For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,
Romans|11|31|even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
Romans|11|32|For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
Romans|11|33|O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!
Romans|11|34|For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
Romans|11|35|or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
Romans|11|36|
Romans|12|1|your spiritual service.
Romans|12|2|And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, and ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
Romans|12|3|For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.
Romans|12|4|For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:
Romans|12|5|so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.
Romans|12|6|according to the proportion of our faith;
Romans|12|7|to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;
Romans|12|8|with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
Romans|12|9|Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Romans|12|10|In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;
Romans|12|11|in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Romans|12|12|rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;
Romans|12|13|communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.
Romans|12|14|Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.
Romans|12|15|Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
Romans|12|16|Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Romans|12|17|Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.
Romans|12|18|If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.
Romans|12|19|: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.
Romans|12|20|But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.
Romans|12|21|
Romans|13|1|that be are ordained of God.
Romans|13|2|Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.
Romans|13|3|For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:
Romans|13|4|for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.
Romans|13|5|must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
Romans|13|6|For this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.
Romans|13|7|; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
Romans|13|8|Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.
Romans|13|9|For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Romans|13|10|Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.
Romans|13|11|believed.
Romans|13|12|The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Romans|13|13|Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.
Romans|13|14|
Romans|14|1|not for decision of scruples.
Romans|14|2|One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.
Romans|14|3|Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Romans|14|4|Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.
Romans|14|5|. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
Romans|14|6|He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
Romans|14|7|For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.
Romans|14|8|For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
Romans|14|9|, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
Romans|14|10|But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
Romans|14|11|
Romans|14|12|So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Romans|14|13|Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.
Romans|14|14|I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Romans|14|15|For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.
Romans|14|16|Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Romans|14|17|for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans|14|18|For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.
Romans|14|19|So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.
Romans|14|20|Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
Romans|14|21|whereby thy brother stumbleth.
Romans|14|22|The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.
Romans|14|23|
Romans|15|1|Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Romans|15|2|Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.
Romans|15|3|For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
Romans|15|4|For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
Romans|15|5|Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:
Romans|15|6|that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|15|7|Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
Romans|15|8|unto the fathers,
Romans|15|9|
Romans|15|10|
Romans|15|11|
Romans|15|12|
Romans|15|13|Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|14|And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Romans|15|15|But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,
Romans|15|16|that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|17|I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
Romans|15|18|For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
Romans|15|19|in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;
Romans|15|20|named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;
Romans|15|21|
Romans|15|22|Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:
Romans|15|23|but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,
Romans|15|24|whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--
Romans|15|25|, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.
Romans|15|26|For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.
Romans|15|27|also to minister unto them in carnal things.
Romans|15|28|When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.
Romans|15|29|And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
Romans|15|30|Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
Romans|15|31|for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
Romans|15|32|that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.
Romans|15|33|
Romans|16|1|I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:
Romans|16|2|that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and of mine own self.
Romans|16|3|Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans|16|4|who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:
Romans|16|5|the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ.
Romans|16|6|Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on you.
Romans|16|7|Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.
Romans|16|8|Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Romans|16|9|Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Romans|16|10|of Aristobulus.
Romans|16|11|of Narcissus, that are in the Lord.
Romans|16|12|Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
Romans|16|13|Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Romans|16|14|Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.
Romans|16|15|Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
Romans|16|16|Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
Romans|16|17|Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.
Romans|16|18|For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.
Romans|16|19|For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil.
Romans|16|20|And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Romans|16|21|Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
Romans|16|22|I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Romans|16|23|Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
Romans|16|24|
Romans|16|25|Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal,
Romans|16|26|but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith:
Romans|16|27|
John|1|1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John|1|2|The same was in the beginning with God.
John|1|3|All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.
John|1|4|In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John|1|5|And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
John|1|6|There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
John|1|7|The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
John|1|8|that he might bear witness of the light.
John|1|9|which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
John|1|10|He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
John|1|11|He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.
John|1|12|to them that believe on his name:
John|1|13|who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John|1|14|And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.
John|1|15|John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.
John|1|16|For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.
John|1|17|For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
John|1|18|.
John|1|19|And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?
John|1|20|And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.
John|1|21|And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
John|1|22|They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
John|1|23|He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.
John|1|24|And they had been sent from the Pharisees.
John|1|25|And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?
John|1|26|John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,
John|1|27|he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
John|1|28|These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John|1|29|On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!
John|1|30|This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.
John|1|31|And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.
John|1|32|And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.
John|1|33|And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.
John|1|34|And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
John|1|35|Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;
John|1|36|and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!
John|1|37|And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
John|1|38|And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?
John|1|39|He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.
John|1|40|, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
John|1|41|He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
John|1|42|He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
John|1|43|On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.
John|1|44|Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
John|1|45|Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
John|1|46|And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
John|1|47|Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
John|1|48|Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
John|1|49|Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.
John|1|50|Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
John|1|51|
John|2|1|And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
John|2|2|and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.
John|2|3|And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
John|2|4|And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
John|2|5|His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
John|2|6|Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.
John|2|7|Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
John|2|8|And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.
John|2|9|And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,
John|2|10|that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.
John|2|11|This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
John|2|12|brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.
John|2|13|And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|2|14|And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
John|2|15|and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;
John|2|16|and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
John|2|17|His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.
John|2|18|The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
John|2|19|Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
John|2|20|The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
John|2|21|But he spake of the temple of his body.
John|2|22|When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
John|2|23|Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.
John|2|24|But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,
John|2|25|
John|3|1|Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
John|3|2|the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.
John|3|3|Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John|3|4|Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
John|3|5|Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!
John|3|6|That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John|3|7|Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.
John|3|8|The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
John|3|9|Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
John|3|10|Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?
John|3|11|Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
John|3|12|If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?
John|3|13|the Son of man, who is in heaven.
John|3|14|And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;
John|3|15|that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.
John|3|16|For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
John|3|17|For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.
John|3|18|He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John|3|19|And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
John|3|20|For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.
John|3|21|But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.
John|3|22|After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
John|3|23|And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
John|3|24|For John was not yet cast into prison.
John|3|25|There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.
John|3|26|And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
John|3|27|John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.
John|3|28|Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.
John|3|29|He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.
John|3|30|He must increase, but I must decrease.
John|3|31|He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
John|3|32|What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
John|3|33|, that God is true.
John|3|34|For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.
John|3|35|The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
John|3|36|
John|4|1|When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John|4|2|(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),
John|4|3|he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
John|4|4|And he must needs pass through Samaria.
John|4|5|So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:
John|4|6|and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
John|4|7|There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
John|4|8|For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.
John|4|9|The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John|4|10|Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
John|4|11|The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?
John|4|12|Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
John|4|13|Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
John|4|14|but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.
John|4|15|The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
John|4|16|Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
John|4|17|The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:
John|4|18|for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.
John|4|19|The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
John|4|20|Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
John|4|21|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
John|4|22|Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
John|4|23|But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.
John|4|24|God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
John|4|25|The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.
John|4|26|.
John|4|27|And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?
John|4|28|So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,
John|4|29|I did: can this be the Christ?
John|4|30|They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
John|4|31|In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
John|4|32|But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.
John|4|33|to eat?
John|4|34|Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
John|4|35|cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.
John|4|36|He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
John|4|37|For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
John|4|38|I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.
John|4|39|I did.
John|4|40|So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
John|4|41|And many more believed because of his word;
John|4|42|and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
John|4|43|And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
John|4|44|For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
John|4|45|So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
John|4|46|He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
John|4|47|that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
John|4|48|Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.
John|4|49|The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
John|4|50|Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.
John|4|51|And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.
John|4|52|So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John|4|53|at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
John|4|54|
John|5|1|After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|5|2|a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.
John|5|3|
John|5|4|
John|5|5|And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.
John|5|6|, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?
John|5|7|The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
John|5|8|Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|9|And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.
John|5|10|So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.
John|5|11|But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
John|5|12|, and walk?
John|5|13|But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.
John|5|14|Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.
John|5|15|The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
John|5|16|And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.
John|5|17|But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.
John|5|18|For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
John|5|19|Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.
John|5|20|For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.
John|5|21|For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.
John|5|22|For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;
John|5|23|that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.
John|5|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.
John|5|25|Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.
John|5|26|For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:
John|5|27|and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.
John|5|28|Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,
John|5|29|and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
John|5|30|I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John|5|31|If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
John|5|32|It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
John|5|33|Ye have sent unto John, and he hath borne witness unto the truth.
John|5|34|But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.
John|5|35|He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.
John|5|36|John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
John|5|37|And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.
John|5|38|And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
John|5|39|Ye search the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of me;
John|5|40|and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.
John|5|41|I receive not glory from men.
John|5|42|But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.
John|5|43|I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
John|5|44|from the only God ye seek not?
John|5|45|Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.
John|5|46|For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.
John|5|47|
John|6|1|of Tiberias.
John|6|2|And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.
John|6|3|And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
John|6|4|Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
John|6|5|Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?
John|6|6|And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
John|6|7|Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
John|6|8|One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,
John|6|9|There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?
John|6|10|Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
John|6|11|Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.
John|6|12|And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.
John|6|13|So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten.
John|6|14|When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.
John|6|15|Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain himself alone.
John|6|16|And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the sea;
John|6|17|and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John|6|18|And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.
John|6|19|When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.
John|6|20|But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
John|6|21|They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.
John|6|22|his disciples went away alone
John|6|23|(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):
John|6|24|when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
John|6|25|And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
John|6|26|Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.
John|6|27|Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.
John|6|28|They said therefore unto him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?
John|6|29|Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
John|6|30|They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou?
John|6|31|Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.
John|6|32|Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.
John|6|33|For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
John|6|34|They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
John|6|35|Jesus said unto them. I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
John|6|36|But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.
John|6|37|All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
John|6|38|For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
John|6|39|And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.
John|6|40|For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
John|6|41|The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.
John|6|42|And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven?
John|6|43|Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
John|6|44|No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.
John|6|45|It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.
John|6|46|Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from God, he hath seen the Father.
John|6|47|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.
John|6|48|I am the bread of life.
John|6|49|Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
John|6|50|This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
John|6|51|I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
John|6|52|The Jews therefore strove one with another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
John|6|53|Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.
John|6|54|He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
John|6|55|For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
John|6|56|He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.
John|6|57|As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.
John|6|58|This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.
John|6|59|These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
John|6|60|, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
John|6|61|But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble?
John|6|62|then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?
John|6|63|It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.
John|6|64|But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.
John|6|65|And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father.
John|6|66|Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
John|6|67|Jesus said therefore unto the twelve, Would ye also go away?
John|6|68|Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
John|6|69|And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God.
John|6|70|Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?
John|6|71|
John|7|1|And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
John|7|2|Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
John|7|3|His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.
John|7|4|For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
John|7|5|For even his brethren did not believe on him.
John|7|6|Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
John|7|7|The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
John|7|8|Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.
John|7|9|in Galilee.
John|7|10|But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
John|7|11|The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
John|7|12|And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.
John|7|13|Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
John|7|14|But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
John|7|15|The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
John|7|16|Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
John|7|17|I speak from myself.
John|7|18|He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
John|7|19|none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?
John|7|20|The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?
John|7|21|Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.
John|7|22|Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
John|7|23|If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?
John|7|24|Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
John|7|25|Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
John|7|26|And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?
John|7|27|Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.
John|7|28|Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
John|7|29|I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
John|7|30|They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
John|7|31|But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?
John|7|32|The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.
John|7|33|Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.
John|7|34|Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
John|7|35|The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
John|7|36|What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
John|7|37|of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
John|7|38|He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
John|7|39|; because Jesus was not yet glorified.
John|7|40|of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
John|7|41|Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
John|7|42|Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
John|7|43|So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
John|7|44|And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
John|7|45|The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?
John|7|46|The officers answered, Never a man so spake.
John|7|47|The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?
John|7|48|Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?
John|7|49|But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.
John|7|50|Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),
John|7|51|Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?
John|7|52|
John|7|53|
John|8|1|but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
John|8|2|And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
John|8|3|And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
John|8|4|they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.
John|8|5|Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?
John|8|6|to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|7|But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
John|8|8|And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
John|8|9|unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
John|8|10|And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?
John|8|11|And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.
John|8|12|Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John|8|13|The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
John|8|14|Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
John|8|15|Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
John|8|16|Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
John|8|17|Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
John|8|18|I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
John|8|19|They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
John|8|20|These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
John|8|21|He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.
John|8|22|The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?
John|8|23|And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
John|8|24|, ye shall die in your sins.
John|8|25|They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
John|8|26|I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
John|8|27|They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.
John|8|28|I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
John|8|29|And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
John|8|30|As he spake these things, many believed on him.
John|8|31|are ye truly my disciples;
John|8|32|and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
John|8|33|They answered unto him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
John|8|34|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
John|8|35|And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
John|8|36|If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
John|8|37|I know that ye are Abraham’s seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
John|8|38|father.
John|8|39|They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
John|8|40|But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
John|8|41|God.
John|8|42|Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
John|8|43|because ye cannot hear my word.
John|8|44|father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
John|8|45|But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
John|8|46|Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?
John|8|47|not, because ye are not of God.
John|8|48|The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
John|8|49|Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
John|8|50|But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
John|8|51|Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
John|8|52|The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
John|8|53|Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
John|8|54|Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;
John|8|55|and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.
John|8|56|Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
John|8|57|The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
John|8|58|Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
John|8|59|
John|9|1|And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.
John|9|2|And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
John|9|3|Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
John|9|4|We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
John|9|5|When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John|9|6|When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,
John|9|7|and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
John|9|8|The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
John|9|9|.
John|9|10|They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?
John|9|11|He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.
John|9|12|And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.
John|9|13|They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
John|9|14|Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
John|9|15|Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
John|9|16|Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was division among them.
John|9|17|They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
John|9|18|The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
John|9|19|and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
John|9|20|His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
John|9|21|but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.
John|9|22|Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John|9|23|Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
John|9|24|So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.
John|9|25|He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
John|9|26|They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?
John|9|27|He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?
John|9|28|And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
John|9|29|We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
John|9|30|he opened mine eyes.
John|9|31|We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.
John|9|32|Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.
John|9|33|If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
John|9|34|They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
John|9|35|Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
John|9|36|He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?
John|9|37|Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.
John|9|38|And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
John|9|39|And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.
John|9|40|Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?
John|9|41|
John|10|1|Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
John|10|2|But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John|10|3|To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
John|10|4|When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
John|10|5|And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
John|10|6|This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
John|10|7|Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
John|10|8|All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
John|10|9|I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.
John|10|10|abundantly.
John|10|11|I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
John|10|12|:
John|10|13|because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
John|10|14|I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,
John|10|15|even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.
John|10|16|And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.
John|10|17|Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
John|10|18|No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.
John|10|19|There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.
John|10|20|And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?
John|10|21|Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
John|10|22|And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:
John|10|23|it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
John|10|24|The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
John|10|25|Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.
John|10|26|But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.
John|10|27|My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
John|10|28|and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
John|10|29|out of the Father’s hand.
John|10|30|I and the Father are one.
John|10|31|The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
John|10|32|Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
John|10|33|The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
John|10|34|Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?
John|10|35|If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
John|10|36|Son of God?
John|10|37|If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
John|10|38|But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
John|10|39|They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.
John|10|40|And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there be abode.
John|10|41|And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.
John|10|42|
John|11|1|Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
John|11|2|And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John|11|3|The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
John|11|4|But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.
John|11|5|Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
John|11|6|When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.
John|11|7|Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
John|11|8|The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
John|11|9|Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
John|11|10|But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
John|11|11|These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
John|11|12|The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.
John|11|13|Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.
John|11|14|Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
John|11|15|And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
John|11|16|Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
John|11|17|So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
John|11|18|Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
John|11|19|and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
John|11|20|Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.
John|11|21|Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|22|And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
John|11|23|Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
John|11|24|Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
John|11|25|Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;
John|11|26|and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?
John|11|27|he that cometh into the world.
John|11|28|And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.
John|11|29|And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.
John|11|30|(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)
John|11|31|The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.
John|11|32|Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
John|11|33|weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
John|11|34|and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.
John|11|35|Jesus wept.
John|11|36|The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!
John|11|37|But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?
John|11|38|Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
John|11|39|four days.
John|11|40|Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
John|11|41|So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.
John|11|42|And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.
John|11|43|And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
John|11|44|He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
John|11|45|Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.
John|11|46|But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
John|11|47|The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.
John|11|48|If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
John|11|49|But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
John|11|50|nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
John|11|51|Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
John|11|52|and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.
John|11|53|So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
John|11|54|Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.
John|11|55|Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.
John|11|56|They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?
John|11|57|
John|12|1|Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.
John|12|2|So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
John|12|3|Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
John|12|4|But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,
John|12|5|Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?
John|12|6|Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.
John|12|7|Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.
John|12|8|For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
John|12|9|The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
John|12|10|But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;
John|12|11|because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
John|12|12|On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
John|12|13|he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.
John|12|14|And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
John|12|15|Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.
John|12|16|These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
John|12|17|The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
John|12|18|For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.
John|12|19|The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.
John|12|20|Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:
John|12|21|these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
John|12|22|Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.
John|12|23|And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
John|12|24|Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
John|12|25|He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
John|12|26|If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.
John|12|27|Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.
John|12|28|, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
John|12|29|The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
John|12|30|Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
John|12|31|Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
John|12|32|And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.
John|12|33|But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|12|34|The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
John|12|35|Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
John|12|36|While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.
John|12|37|But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:
John|12|38|
John|12|39|
John|12|40|
John|12|41|These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.
John|12|42|, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
John|12|43|of God.
John|12|44|And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
John|12|45|And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.
John|12|46|I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.
John|12|47|And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
John|12|48|He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.
John|12|49|For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
John|12|50|
John|13|1|Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
John|13|2|, to betray him,
John|13|3|, knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,
John|13|4|riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.
John|13|5|Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
John|13|6|So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
John|13|7|Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.
John|13|8|Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
John|13|9|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
John|13|10|Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.
John|13|11|For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
John|13|12|So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
John|13|13|Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
John|13|14|If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John|13|15|For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.
John|13|16|Verily, verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.
John|13|17|If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.
John|13|18|I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.
John|13|19|.
John|13|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
John|13|21|When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
John|13|22|The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.
John|13|23|There was at the table reclining in Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
John|13|24|who it is of whom he speaketh.
John|13|25|He leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
John|13|26|of Simon Iscariot.
John|13|27|And after the sop, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly.
John|13|28|Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.
John|13|29|For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
John|13|30|He then having received the sop went out straightway: and it was night.
John|13|31|When therefore he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him;
John|13|32|and God shall glorify him in himself, and straightway shall he glorify him.
John|13|33|Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say unto you.
John|13|34|A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; even as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
John|13|35|By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
John|13|36|Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered, Whither I go, thou canst not follow now; but thou shalt follow afterwards.
John|13|37|Peter saith unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee even now? I will lay down my life for thee.
John|13|38|
John|14|1|Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.
John|14|2|In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
John|14|3|ye may be also.
John|14|4|And whither I go, ye know the way.
John|14|5|Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?
John|14|6|Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John|14|7|If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
John|14|8|Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
John|14|9|Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
John|14|10|Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.
John|14|11|Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
John|14|12|than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
John|14|13|And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John|14|14|If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
John|14|15|If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.
John|14|16|And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,
John|14|17|the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
John|14|18|I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.
John|14|19|Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.
John|14|20|In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
John|14|21|He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.
John|14|22|Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
John|14|23|Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
John|14|24|He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
John|14|25|abiding with you.
John|14|26|the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.
John|14|27|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
John|14|28|Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
John|14|29|And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
John|14|30|I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;
John|14|31|
John|15|1|I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
John|15|2|that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit.
John|15|3|Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you.
John|15|4|Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me.
John|15|5|I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing.
John|15|6|If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
John|15|7|If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
John|15|8|shall ye be my disciples.
John|15|9|Even as the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you: abide ye in my love.
John|15|10|If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.
John|15|11|your joy may be made full.
John|15|12|This is my commandment, that ye love one another, even as I have loved you.
John|15|13|Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
John|15|14|Ye are my friends, if ye do the things which I command you.
John|15|15|No longer do I call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.
John|15|16|your fruit should abide: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
John|15|17|These things I command you, that ye may love one another.
John|15|18|you.
John|15|19|If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
John|15|20|Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
John|15|21|But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.
John|15|22|If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John|15|23|He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
John|15|24|If I had not done among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
John|15|25|, that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
John|15|26|the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me:
John|15|27|
John|16|1|These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.
John|16|2|They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God.
John|16|3|And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
John|16|4|But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you. And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.
John|16|5|But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
John|16|6|But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
John|16|7|Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
John|16|8|And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
John|16|9|of sin, because they believe not on me;
John|16|10|of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more;
John|16|11|of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
John|16|12|I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
John|16|13|shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.
John|16|14|unto you.
John|16|15|unto you.
John|16|16|A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.
John|16|17|of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
John|16|18|They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.
John|16|19|Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?
John|16|20|Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
John|16|21|A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.
John|16|22|And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.
John|16|23|And in that day ye shall ask me no question. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.
John|16|24|Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
John|16|25|These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.
John|16|26|In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you;
John|16|27|for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
John|16|28|I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.
John|16|29|His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.
John|16|30|Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
John|16|31|Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
John|16|32|I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
John|16|33|
John|17|1|These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the son may glorify thee:
John|17|2|even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.
John|17|3|Jesus Christ.
John|17|4|I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.
John|17|5|And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
John|17|6|I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
John|17|7|Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:
John|17|8|, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
John|17|9|I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:
John|17|10|and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
John|17|11|.
John|17|12|While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
John|17|13|But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
John|17|14|I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John|17|15|.
John|17|16|They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
John|17|17|Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.
John|17|18|As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.
John|17|19|And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
John|17|20|Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;
John|17|21|in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
John|17|22|one;
John|17|23|I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.
John|17|24|Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
John|17|25|O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;
John|17|26|
John|18|1|When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples.
John|18|2|Now Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples.
John|18|3|, and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
John|18|4|Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye?
John|18|5|. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them.
John|18|6|, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
John|18|7|Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
John|18|8|; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:
John|18|9|that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one.
John|18|10|Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.
John|18|11|Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
John|18|12|So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,
John|18|13|and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John|18|14|Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
John|18|15|another disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
John|18|16|but Peter was standing at the door without. So the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
John|18|17|of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.
John|18|18|, having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
John|18|19|The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
John|18|20|Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing.
John|18|21|, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.
John|18|22|And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
John|18|23|Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
John|18|24|Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
John|18|25|of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.
John|18|26|One of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
John|18|27|Peter therefore denied again: and straightway the cock crew.
John|18|28|They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
John|18|29|Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?
John|18|30|They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.
John|18|31|Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
John|18|32|that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
John|18|33|Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
John|18|34|Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?
John|18|35|Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
John|18|36|Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
John|18|37|Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
John|18|38|Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.
John|18|39|But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
John|18|40|
John|19|1|Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
John|19|2|And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;
John|19|3|and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.
John|19|4|And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.
John|19|5|saith unto them, Behold, the man!
John|19|6|! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.
John|19|7|The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
John|19|8|When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;
John|19|9|and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John|19|10|Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?
John|19|11|Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.
John|19|12|Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
John|19|13|When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John|19|14|Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!
John|19|15|, crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
John|19|16|Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.
John|19|17|They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:
John|19|18|where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.
John|19|19|And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John|19|20|in Greek.
John|19|21|The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
John|19|22|Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
John|19|23|The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
John|19|24|
John|19|25|of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
John|19|26|When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
John|19|27|.
John|19|28|After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
John|19|29|There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.
John|19|30|When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
John|19|31|they might be taken away.
John|19|32|The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:
John|19|33|but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:
John|19|34|howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.
John|19|35|And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.
John|19|36|For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
John|19|37|And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
John|19|38|leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.
John|19|39|And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
John|19|40|So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
John|19|41|Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.
John|19|42|
John|20|1|of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.
John|20|2|She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
John|20|3|Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.
John|20|4|And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
John|20|5|and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.
John|20|6|Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,
John|20|7|and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
John|20|8|Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.
John|20|9|For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
John|20|10|So the disciples went away again unto their own home.
John|20|11|But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;
John|20|12|and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John|20|13|And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
John|20|14|When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
John|20|15|Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
John|20|16|Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.
John|20|17|Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.
John|20|18|he had said these things unto her.
John|20|19|unto you.
John|20|20|And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
John|20|21|unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
John|20|22|And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:
John|20|23|ye retain, they are retained.
John|20|24|But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John|20|25|The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
John|20|26|unto you.
John|20|27|thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
John|20|28|Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
John|20|29|have believed.
John|20|30|Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:
John|20|31|
John|21|1|on this wise.
John|21|2|of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
John|21|3|Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.
John|21|4|But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
John|21|5|Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.
John|21|6|And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
John|21|7|That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
John|21|8|of fishes.
John|21|9|So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
John|21|10|Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.
John|21|11|Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.
John|21|12|break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
John|21|13|Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.
John|21|14|This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
John|21|15|of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
John|21|16|of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.
John|21|17|of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
John|21|18|Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
John|21|19|Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
John|21|20|Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?
John|21|21|Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
John|21|22|to thee? Follow thou me.
John|21|23|to thee?
John|21|24|This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.
John|21|25|
Zephaniah|1|1|The word of Jehovah which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
Zephaniah|1|2|I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|3|I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith Jehovah.
Zephaniah|1|4|the name of the Chemarim with the priests;
Zephaniah|1|5|and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam;
Zephaniah|1|6|and them that are turned back from following Jehovah; and those that have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired after him.
Zephaniah|1|7|Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord Jehovah; for the day of Jehovah is at hand: for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath consecrated his guests.
Zephaniah|1|8|And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
Zephaniah|1|9|And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah|1|10|And in that day, saith Jehovah, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
Zephaniah|1|11|Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.
Zephaniah|1|12|And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil.
Zephaniah|1|13|And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.
Zephaniah|1|14|the voice of the day of Jehovah; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.
Zephaniah|1|15|That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
Zephaniah|1|16|a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.
Zephaniah|1|17|And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
Zephaniah|1|18|
Zephaniah|2|1|Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;
Zephaniah|2|2|the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.
Zephaniah|2|3|Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.
Zephaniah|2|4|For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
Zephaniah|2|5|Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|2|6|And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
Zephaniah|2|7|thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.
Zephaniah|2|8|I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
Zephaniah|2|9|Therefore as I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.
Zephaniah|2|10|This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.
Zephaniah|2|11|Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.
Zephaniah|2|12|Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
Zephaniah|2|13|And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
Zephaniah|2|14|voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.
Zephaniah|2|15|
Zephaniah|3|1|Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!
Zephaniah|3|2|She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.
Zephaniah|3|3|Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.
Zephaniah|3|4|Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.
Zephaniah|3|5|Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
Zephaniah|3|6|I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
Zephaniah|3|7|all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.
Zephaniah|3|8|Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
Zephaniah|3|9|For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.
Zephaniah|3|10|From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.
Zephaniah|3|11|In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.
Zephaniah|3|12|But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.
Zephaniah|3|13|The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
Zephaniah|3|14|Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
Zephaniah|3|15|Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.
Zephaniah|3|16|In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
Zephaniah|3|17|Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.
Zephaniah|3|18|the burden upon her was a reproach.
Zephaniah|3|19|Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.
Zephaniah|3|20|
Ecclesiastes|1|1|The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|2|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|1|3|What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|1|4|One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth for ever.
Ecclesiastes|1|5|The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.
Ecclesiastes|1|6|The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.
Ecclesiastes|1|7|All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.
Ecclesiastes|1|8|: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes|1|9|That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|1|10|Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
Ecclesiastes|1|11|that are to come, among those that shall come after.
Ecclesiastes|1|12|I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes|1|13|And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|1|14|I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|15|That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
Ecclesiastes|1|16|I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten me great wisdom above all that were before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
Ecclesiastes|1|17|And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|1|18|
Ecclesiastes|2|1|I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|2|I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?
Ecclesiastes|2|3|with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
Ecclesiastes|2|4|I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
Ecclesiastes|2|5|I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;
Ecclesiastes|2|6|I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared;
Ecclesiastes|2|7|I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;
Ecclesiastes|2|8|I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
Ecclesiastes|2|9|So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
Ecclesiastes|2|10|And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.
Ecclesiastes|2|11|Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|12|that which hath been done long ago.
Ecclesiastes|2|13|Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
Ecclesiastes|2|14|The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes|2|15|Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|16|For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool!
Ecclesiastes|2|17|So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|2|18|And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
Ecclesiastes|2|19|And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|20|Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|2|21|For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
Ecclesiastes|2|22|For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun?
Ecclesiastes|2|23|sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|2|24|that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes|2|25|For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
Ecclesiastes|2|26|
Ecclesiastes|3|1|For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
Ecclesiastes|3|2|a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
Ecclesiastes|3|3|a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
Ecclesiastes|3|4|a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
Ecclesiastes|3|5|a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
Ecclesiastes|3|6|a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
Ecclesiastes|3|7|a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
Ecclesiastes|3|8|a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes|3|9|What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
Ecclesiastes|3|10|I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
Ecclesiastes|3|11|He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.
Ecclesiastes|3|12|I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.
Ecclesiastes|3|13|And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes|3|14|I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.
Ecclesiastes|3|15|That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.
Ecclesiastes|3|16|And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
Ecclesiastes|3|17|I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes|3|18|beasts.
Ecclesiastes|3|19|For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|3|20|All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes|3|21|Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes|3|22|
Ecclesiastes|4|1|Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.
Ecclesiastes|4|2|Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive;
Ecclesiastes|4|3|him that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|4|Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|5|The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes|4|6|Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|4|7|Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|4|8|, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
Ecclesiastes|4|9|Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
Ecclesiastes|4|10|For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.
Ecclesiastes|4|11|?
Ecclesiastes|4|12|And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes|4|13|Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
Ecclesiastes|4|14|For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.
Ecclesiastes|4|15|I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead.
Ecclesiastes|4|16|
Ecclesiastes|5|1|Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.
Ecclesiastes|5|2|Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
Ecclesiastes|5|3|For a dream cometh with a multitude of business, and a fool’s voice with a multitude of words.
Ecclesiastes|5|4|When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest.
Ecclesiastes|5|5|Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes|5|6|Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that is was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
Ecclesiastes|5|7|For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words: but fear thou God.
Ecclesiastes|5|8|If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for one higher than the high regardeth; and there are higher than they.
Ecclesiastes|5|9|is served by the field.
Ecclesiastes|5|10|He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|5|11|with his eyes?
Ecclesiastes|5|12|The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
Ecclesiastes|5|13|, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt:
Ecclesiastes|5|14|and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.
Ecclesiastes|5|15|As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.
Ecclesiastes|5|16|And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth for the wind?
Ecclesiastes|5|17|All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore vexed, and hath sickness and wrath.
Ecclesiastes|5|18|Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for this is his portion.
Ecclesiastes|5|19|Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes|5|20|
Ecclesiastes|6|1|There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:
Ecclesiastes|6|2|a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
Ecclesiastes|6|3|If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he:
Ecclesiastes|6|4|for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;
Ecclesiastes|6|5|moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath rest rather than the other:
Ecclesiastes|6|6|yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoy no good, do not all go to one place?
Ecclesiastes|6|7|All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
Ecclesiastes|6|8|what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the living?
Ecclesiastes|6|9|Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
Ecclesiastes|6|10|Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago; and it is know what man is; neither can he contend with him that is mightier than he.
Ecclesiastes|6|11|Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?
Ecclesiastes|6|12|
Ecclesiastes|7|1|name is better than precious oil; and the day of death, than the day of one’s birth.
Ecclesiastes|7|2|It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
Ecclesiastes|7|3|Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.
Ecclesiastes|7|4|The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
Ecclesiastes|7|5|It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes|7|6|For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|7|7|Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding.
Ecclesiastes|7|8|the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes|7|9|Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes|7|10|Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
Ecclesiastes|7|11|Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.
Ecclesiastes|7|12|For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.
Ecclesiastes|7|13|Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
Ecclesiastes|7|14|after him.
Ecclesiastes|7|15|in his evil-doing.
Ecclesiastes|7|16|Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
Ecclesiastes|7|17|Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
Ecclesiastes|7|18|It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth from them all.
Ecclesiastes|7|19|Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.
Ecclesiastes|7|20|Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
Ecclesiastes|7|21|Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;
Ecclesiastes|7|22|for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
Ecclesiastes|7|23|All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
Ecclesiastes|7|24|That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find it out?
Ecclesiastes|7|25|, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.
Ecclesiastes|7|26|whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
Ecclesiastes|7|27|one thing to another, to find out the account;
Ecclesiastes|7|28|which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
Ecclesiastes|7|29|
Ecclesiastes|8|1|Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.
Ecclesiastes|8|2|, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.
Ecclesiastes|8|3|Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
Ecclesiastes|8|4|power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
Ecclesiastes|8|5|Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:
Ecclesiastes|8|6|for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:
Ecclesiastes|8|7|for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?
Ecclesiastes|8|8|There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.
Ecclesiastes|8|9|a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.
Ecclesiastes|8|10|; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|8|11|Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Ecclesiastes|8|12|, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him:
Ecclesiastes|8|13|as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
Ecclesiastes|8|14|There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|8|15|the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|8|16|When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),
Ecclesiastes|8|17|
Ecclesiastes|9|1|For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.
Ecclesiastes|9|2|he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.
Ecclesiastes|9|3|to the dead.
Ecclesiastes|9|4|For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes|9|5|For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes|9|6|As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|9|7|Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.
Ecclesiastes|9|8|Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack oil.
Ecclesiastes|9|9|Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun.
Ecclesiastes|9|10|with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, whither thou goest.
Ecclesiastes|9|11|I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes|9|12|For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
Ecclesiastes|9|13|I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise, and it seemed great unto me:
Ecclesiastes|9|14|There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
Ecclesiastes|9|15|Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
Ecclesiastes|9|16|Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes|9|17|The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
Ecclesiastes|9|18|
Ecclesiastes|10|1|doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
Ecclesiastes|10|2|A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
Ecclesiastes|10|3|he is a fool.
Ecclesiastes|10|4|If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.
Ecclesiastes|10|5|There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
Ecclesiastes|10|6|folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
Ecclesiastes|10|7|I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like servants upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|10|8|He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
Ecclesiastes|10|9|he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
Ecclesiastes|10|10|If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
Ecclesiastes|10|11|If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.
Ecclesiastes|10|12|The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
Ecclesiastes|10|13|The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
Ecclesiastes|10|14|man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
Ecclesiastes|10|15|The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth not how to go to the city.
Ecclesiastes|10|16|Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
Ecclesiastes|10|17|Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Ecclesiastes|10|18|By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
Ecclesiastes|10|19|A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.
Ecclesiastes|10|20|
Ecclesiastes|11|1|Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes|11|2|Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes|11|3|If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
Ecclesiastes|11|4|He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
Ecclesiastes|11|5|in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all.
Ecclesiastes|11|6|In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
Ecclesiastes|11|7|Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
Ecclesiastes|11|8|Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|11|9|Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
Ecclesiastes|11|10|
Ecclesiastes|12|1|Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes|12|2|before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain;
Ecclesiastes|12|3|in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened,
Ecclesiastes|12|4|and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
Ecclesiastes|12|5|in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes|12|6|before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern,
Ecclesiastes|12|7|and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes|12|8|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes|12|9|set in order many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes|12|10|words of truth.
Ecclesiastes|12|11|are given from one shepherd.
Ecclesiastes|12|12|And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes|12|13|of man.
Ecclesiastes|12|14|
2 Kings|1|1|And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 Kings|1|2|And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.
2 Kings|1|3|But the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
2 Kings|1|4|
2 Kings|1|5|And the messengers returned unto him, and he said unto them, Why is it that ye are returned?
2 Kings|1|6|And they said unto him, There came up a man to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed whither thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
2 Kings|1|7|And he said unto them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?
2 Kings|1|8|
2 Kings|1|9|sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he spake unto him, O man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
2 Kings|1|10|And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|11|And again he sent unto him another captain of fifty and his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
2 Kings|1|12|And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
2 Kings|1|13|And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|14|Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in thy sight.
2 Kings|1|15|And the angel of Jehovah said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
2 Kings|1|16|
2 Kings|1|17|So he died according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings|1|18|
2 Kings|2|1|And it came to pass, when Jehovah would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
2 Kings|2|2|And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me as far as Beth-el. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
2 Kings|2|3|And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|4|And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
2 Kings|2|5|And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that Jehovah will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
2 Kings|2|6|And Elijah said unto him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
2 Kings|2|7|And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|8|And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
2 Kings|2|9|And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2 Kings|2|10|, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
2 Kings|2|11|a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
2 Kings|2|12|And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
2 Kings|2|13|He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2 Kings|2|14|
2 Kings|2|15|And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2 Kings|2|16|And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
2 Kings|2|17|And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
2 Kings|2|18|
2 Kings|2|19|And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.
2 Kings|2|20|And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
2 Kings|2|21|And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus saith Jehovah, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.
2 Kings|2|22|
2 Kings|2|23|And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth young lads out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.
2 Kings|2|24|And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two lads of them.
2 Kings|2|25|
2 Kings|3|1|Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
2 Kings|3|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
2 Kings|3|3|
2 Kings|3|4|Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of a hundred thousand lambs, and of a hundred thousand rams.
2 Kings|3|5|But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings|3|6|And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
2 Kings|3|7|And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
2 Kings|3|8|And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
2 Kings|3|9|So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.
2 Kings|3|10|And the king of Israel said, Alas! for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|11|But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
2 Kings|3|12|
2 Kings|3|13|And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay; for Jehovah hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
2 Kings|3|14|And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
2 Kings|3|15|But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.
2 Kings|3|16|And he said, Thus saith Jehovah, Make this valley full of trenches.
2 Kings|3|17|For thus saith Jehovah, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.
2 Kings|3|18|And this is but a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
2 Kings|3|19|And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2 Kings|3|20|
2 Kings|3|21|Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.
2 Kings|3|22|And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:
2 Kings|3|23|and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
2 Kings|3|24|And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.
2 Kings|3|25|they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
2 Kings|3|26|And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.
2 Kings|3|27|
2 Kings|4|1|Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear Jehovah: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two children to be bondmen.
2 Kings|4|2|And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me; what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not anything in the house, save a pot of oil.
2 Kings|4|3|Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
2 Kings|4|4|And thou shalt go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
2 Kings|4|5|to her, and she poured out.
2 Kings|4|6|And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
2 Kings|4|7|
2 Kings|4|8|And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
2 Kings|4|9|And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passeth by us continually.
2 Kings|4|10|Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
2 Kings|4|11|And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.
2 Kings|4|12|And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
2 Kings|4|13|And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
2 Kings|4|14|And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no son, and her husband is old.
2 Kings|4|15|And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
2 Kings|4|16|
2 Kings|4|17|And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said unto her.
2 Kings|4|18|And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
2 Kings|4|19|And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to his servant, Carry him to his mother.
2 Kings|4|20|And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
2 Kings|4|21|upon him, and went out.
2 Kings|4|22|And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the servants, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
2 Kings|4|23|And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
2 Kings|4|24|Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slacken me not the riding, except I bid thee.
2 Kings|4|25|And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:
2 Kings|4|26|run, I pray thee, now to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.
2 Kings|4|27|And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed within her; and Jehovah hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
2 Kings|4|28|Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
2 Kings|4|29|Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
2 Kings|4|30|And the mother of the child said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
2 Kings|4|31|
2 Kings|4|32|And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
2 Kings|4|33|He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah.
2 Kings|4|34|And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
2 Kings|4|35|Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
2 Kings|4|36|And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
2 Kings|4|37|
2 Kings|4|38|And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
2 Kings|4|39|And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they knew them not.
2 Kings|4|40|So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.
2 Kings|4|41|
2 Kings|4|42|And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
2 Kings|4|43|And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus saith Jehovah, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.
2 Kings|4|44|
2 Kings|5|1|a leper.
2 Kings|5|2|And the Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings|5|3|And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! then would he recover him of his leprosy.
2 Kings|5|4|And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maiden that is of the land of Israel.
2 Kings|5|5|of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
2 Kings|5|6|And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
2 Kings|5|7|
2 Kings|5|8|And it was so, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2 Kings|5|9|So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
2 Kings|5|10|And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
2 Kings|5|11|But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
2 Kings|5|12|Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
2 Kings|5|13|And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
2 Kings|5|14|
2 Kings|5|15|And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.
2 Kings|5|16|But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
2 Kings|5|17|And Naaman said, If not, yet, I pray thee, let there be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto Jehovah.
2 Kings|5|18|In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant in this thing.
2 Kings|5|19|
2 Kings|5|20|But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
2 Kings|5|21|So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
2 Kings|5|22|And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill-country of Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
2 Kings|5|23|And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
2 Kings|5|24|And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.
2 Kings|5|25|But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
2 Kings|5|26|, when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants?
2 Kings|5|27|
2 Kings|6|1|And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell before thee is too strait for us.
2 Kings|6|2|Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
2 Kings|6|3|And one said, Be pleased, I pray thee, to go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
2 Kings|6|4|So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.
2 Kings|6|5|But as one was felling a beam, the axe-head fell into the water; and he cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.
2 Kings|6|6|And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither, and made the iron to swim.
2 Kings|6|7|
2 Kings|6|8|Now the king of Syria was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
2 Kings|6|9|And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are coming down.
2 Kings|6|10|And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved himself there, not once nor twice.
2 Kings|6|11|And the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
2 Kings|6|12|And one of his servants said, Nay, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
2 Kings|6|13|
2 Kings|6|14|Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
2 Kings|6|15|And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host with horses and chariots was round about the city. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
2 Kings|6|16|And he answered, Fear not; for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.
2 Kings|6|17|And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
2 Kings|6|18|And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
2 Kings|6|19|
2 Kings|6|20|And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
2 Kings|6|21|And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
2 Kings|6|22|And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
2 Kings|6|23|
2 Kings|6|24|And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
2 Kings|6|25|of silver.
2 Kings|6|26|And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
2 Kings|6|27|And he said, If Jehovah do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the threshing-floor, or out of the winepress?
2 Kings|6|28|And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
2 Kings|6|29|So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son.
2 Kings|6|30|And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes (now he was passing by upon the wall); and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
2 Kings|6|31|
2 Kings|6|32|sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him: is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?
2 Kings|6|33|
2 Kings|7|1|for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
2 Kings|7|2|
2 Kings|7|3|Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
2 Kings|7|4|If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
2 Kings|7|5|And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.
2 Kings|7|6|For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
2 Kings|7|7|Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
2 Kings|7|8|
2 Kings|7|9|Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.
2 Kings|7|10|So they came and called unto the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were.
2 Kings|7|11|And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s household within.
2 Kings|7|12|And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
2 Kings|7|13|And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are consumed); and let us send and see.
2 Kings|7|14|They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
2 Kings|7|15|
2 Kings|7|16|for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|7|17|And the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
2 Kings|7|18|And it came to pass, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;
2 Kings|7|19|and that captain answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if Jehovah should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof:
2 Kings|7|20|
2 Kings|8|1|Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for Jehovah hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
2 Kings|8|2|And the woman arose, and did according to the word of the man of God; and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2 Kings|8|3|And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
2 Kings|8|4|Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
2 Kings|8|5|And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life him that was dead, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
2 Kings|8|6|
2 Kings|8|7|And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
2 Kings|8|8|And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
2 Kings|8|9|So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
2 Kings|8|10|And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou shalt surely recover; howbeit Jehovah hath showed me that he shall surely die.
2 Kings|8|11|, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
2 Kings|8|12|And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their women with child.
2 Kings|8|13|And Hazael said, But what is thy servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah hath showed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.
2 Kings|8|14|Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou wouldest surely recover.
2 Kings|8|15|
2 Kings|8|16|And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|8|17|Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings|8|18|And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Kings|8|19|
2 Kings|8|20|In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
2 Kings|8|21|Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
2 Kings|8|22|So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.
2 Kings|8|23|And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|8|24|
2 Kings|8|25|In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
2 Kings|8|26|Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
2 Kings|8|27|And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
2 Kings|8|28|And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings|8|29|
2 Kings|9|1|And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings|9|2|And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber.
2 Kings|9|3|Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
2 Kings|9|4|So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
2 Kings|9|5|And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
2 Kings|9|6|And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah, even over Israel.
2 Kings|9|7|And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.
2 Kings|9|8|For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel.
2 Kings|9|9|And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings|9|10|
2 Kings|9|11|Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and what his talk was.
2 Kings|9|12|And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
2 Kings|9|13|
2 Kings|9|14|So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
2 Kings|9|15|but king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.
2 Kings|9|16|
2 Kings|9|17|Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
2 Kings|9|18|So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not back.
2 Kings|9|19|Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
2 Kings|9|20|
2 Kings|9|21|And Joram said, Make ready. And they made ready his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings|9|22|And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
2 Kings|9|23|And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
2 Kings|9|24|And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and smote Joram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
2 Kings|9|25|to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, Jehovah laid this burden upon him:
2 Kings|9|26|
2 Kings|9|27|at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
2 Kings|9|28|
2 Kings|9|29|And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
2 Kings|9|30|And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and looked out at the window.
2 Kings|9|31|And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master’s murderer?
2 Kings|9|32|And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
2 Kings|9|33|And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.
2 Kings|9|34|And when he was come in, he did eat and drink; and he said, See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king’s daughter.
2 Kings|9|35|And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings|9|36|Wherefore they came back, and told him. And he said, This is the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;
2 Kings|9|37|
2 Kings|10|1|Ahab, saying,
2 Kings|10|2|And now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
2 Kings|10|3|look ye out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.
2 Kings|10|4|But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
2 Kings|10|5|, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any man king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.
2 Kings|10|6|Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be on my side, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
2 Kings|10|7|And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them unto him to Jezreel.
2 Kings|10|8|And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
2 Kings|10|9|And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who smote all these?
2 Kings|10|10|Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of Jehovah, which Jehovah spake concerning the house of Ahab: for Jehovah hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.
2 Kings|10|11|
2 Kings|10|12|And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,
2 Kings|10|13|Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah: and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
2 Kings|10|14|And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
2 Kings|10|15|And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
2 Kings|10|16|And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
2 Kings|10|17|
2 Kings|10|18|And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.
2 Kings|10|19|to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings|10|20|And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
2 Kings|10|21|And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.
2 Kings|10|22|And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
2 Kings|10|23|And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah, but the worshippers of Baal only.
2 Kings|10|24|
2 Kings|10|25|And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
2 Kings|10|26|And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
2 Kings|10|27|And they brake down the pillar of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house, unto this day.
2 Kings|10|28|
2 Kings|10|29|, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.
2 Kings|10|30|hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
2 Kings|10|31|
2 Kings|10|32|In those days Jehovah began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
2 Kings|10|33|from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings|10|34|Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|10|35|And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|10|36|
2 Kings|11|1|Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
2 Kings|11|2|in the bedchamber; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain;
2 Kings|11|3|
2 Kings|11|4|And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah; and he made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king’s son.
2 Kings|11|5|And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you, that come in on the sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;
2 Kings|11|6|And a third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
2 Kings|11|7|And the two companies of you, even all that go forth on the sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king.
2 Kings|11|8|
2 Kings|11|9|And the captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they took every man his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath, with those that were to go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings|11|10|And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|11|And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
2 Kings|11|12|
2 Kings|11|13|the people, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah:
2 Kings|11|14|and she looked, and, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!
2 Kings|11|15|And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth between the ranks; and him that followeth her slay with the sword. For the priest said, Let her not be slain in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|16|
2 Kings|11|17|And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah’s people; between the king also and the people.
2 Kings|11|18|And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|11|19|And he took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah, and came by the way of the gate of the guard unto the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
2 Kings|11|20|So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the king’s house.
2 Kings|11|21|
2 Kings|12|1|In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
2 Kings|12|2|And Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings|12|3|
2 Kings|12|4|And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is rated, and all the money that it cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of Jehovah,
2 Kings|12|5|let the priests take it to them, every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
2 Kings|12|6|But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
2 Kings|12|7|money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
2 Kings|12|8|
2 Kings|12|9|But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of Jehovah: and the priests that kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|10|And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|11|And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought upon the house of Jehovah,
2 Kings|12|12|and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
2 Kings|12|13|But there were not made for the house of Jehovah cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah;
2 Kings|12|14|for they gave that to them that did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|12|15|Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to them that did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
2 Kings|12|16|
2 Kings|12|17|Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
2 Kings|12|18|
2 Kings|12|19|Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|12|20|that goeth down to Silla.
2 Kings|12|21|
2 Kings|13|1|seventeen years.
2 Kings|13|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
2 Kings|13|3|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.
2 Kings|13|4|And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah, and Jehovah hearkened unto him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that the king of Syria oppressed them.
2 Kings|13|5|(And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime.
2 Kings|13|6|Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)
2 Kings|13|7|For he left not to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.
2 Kings|13|8|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|13|9|
2 Kings|13|10|sixteen years.
2 Kings|13|11|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.
2 Kings|13|12|Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|13|13|
2 Kings|13|14|Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died: and Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over him, and said, My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!
2 Kings|13|15|And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows; and he took unto him bow and arrows.
2 Kings|13|16|. And Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s hands.
2 Kings|13|17|And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Jehovah’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.
2 Kings|13|18|And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground; and he smote thrice, and stayed.
2 Kings|13|19|
2 Kings|13|20|And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2 Kings|13|21|
2 Kings|13|22|And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings|13|23|But Jehovah was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
2 Kings|13|24|And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|13|25|
2 Kings|14|1|In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|14|2|He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|14|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like David his father: he did according to all that Joash his father had done.
2 Kings|14|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|14|5|And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father:
2 Kings|14|6|but the children of the murderers he put not to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.
2 Kings|14|7|
2 Kings|14|8|Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
2 Kings|14|9|And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
2 Kings|14|10|
2 Kings|14|11|But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
2 Kings|14|12|And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.
2 Kings|14|13|And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2 Kings|14|14|
2 Kings|14|15|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|16|
2 Kings|14|17|And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
2 Kings|14|18|Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|14|19|And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
2 Kings|14|20|And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2 Kings|14|21|And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
2 Kings|14|22|
2 Kings|14|23|forty and one years.
2 Kings|14|24|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|14|25|He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Jehovah, the God of Israel, which he spake by his servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
2 Kings|14|26|For Jehovah saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.
2 Kings|14|27|
2 Kings|14|28|to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|14|29|
2 Kings|15|1|In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|2|Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|15|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
2 Kings|15|4|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2 Kings|15|5|And Jehovah smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
2 Kings|15|6|Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|7|
2 Kings|15|8|In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
2 Kings|15|9|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|10|And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

2 Kings|15|12|
2 Kings|15|13|Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned the space of a month in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|14|And Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|15|Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2 Kings|15|16|
2 Kings|15|17|ten years in Samaria.
2 Kings|15|18|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
2 Kings|15|19|There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
2 Kings|15|20|And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
2 Kings|15|21|Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings|15|22|
2 Kings|15|23|two years.

2 Kings|15|25|And Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the castle of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites: and he slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|15|26|
2 Kings|15|27|twenty years.
2 Kings|15|28|
2 Kings|15|29|In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.
2 Kings|15|30|And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

2 Kings|15|32|In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
2 Kings|15|33|Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings|15|34|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
2 Kings|15|35|Howbeit the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|15|36|Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|15|37|In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings|15|38|
2 Kings|16|1|In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|16|2|Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, like David his father.
2 Kings|16|3|But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|16|4|
2 Kings|16|5|Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
2 Kings|16|6|
2 Kings|16|7|So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
2 Kings|16|8|And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|9|
2 Kings|16|10|And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
2 Kings|16|11|And Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priest make it against the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.
2 Kings|16|12|And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near unto the altar, and offered thereon.
2 Kings|16|13|And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meal-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar.
2 Kings|16|14|And the brazen altar, which was before Jehovah, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah, and put it on the north side of his altar.
2 Kings|16|15|And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meal-offering, and the king’s burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
2 Kings|16|16|
2 Kings|16|17|And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.
2 Kings|16|18|And the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he unto the house of Jehovah, because of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|16|19|Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|16|20|
2 Kings|17|1|nine years.
2 Kings|17|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
2 Kings|17|3|Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
2 Kings|17|4|And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
2 Kings|17|5|Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
2 Kings|17|6|
2 Kings|17|7|And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
2 Kings|17|8|and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Jehovah cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
2 Kings|17|9|And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Jehovah their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city;
2 Kings|17|10|and they set them up pillars and Asherim upon every high hill, and under every green tree;
2 Kings|17|11|and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Jehovah carried away before them; and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
2 Kings|17|12|and they served idols, whereof Jehovah had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
2 Kings|17|13|Yet Jehovah testified unto Israel, and unto Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
2 Kings|17|14|Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like to the neck of their fathers, who believed not in Jehovah their God.
2 Kings|17|15|after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
2 Kings|17|16|And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
2 Kings|17|17|And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Kings|17|18|
2 Kings|17|19|Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
2 Kings|17|20|And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
2 Kings|17|21|For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
2 Kings|17|22|And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
2 Kings|17|23|
2 Kings|17|24|And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
2 Kings|17|25|And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah: therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
2 Kings|17|26|
2 Kings|17|27|Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the law of the god of the land.
2 Kings|17|28|So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
2 Kings|17|29|Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
2 Kings|17|30|And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
2 Kings|17|31|and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings|17|32|So they feared Jehovah, and made unto them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
2 Kings|17|33|
2 Kings|17|34|Unto this day they do after the former manner: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Jehovah commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
2 Kings|17|35|with whom Jehovah had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
2 Kings|17|36|but Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, him shall ye fear, and unto him shall ye bow yourselves, and to him shall ye sacrifice:
2 Kings|17|37|and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods:
2 Kings|17|38|and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:
2 Kings|17|39|but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
2 Kings|17|40|Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
2 Kings|17|41|
2 Kings|18|1|Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2 Kings|18|2|Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings|18|3|And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.
2 Kings|18|4|He removed the high places, and brake the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.
2 Kings|18|5|that were before him.
2 Kings|18|6|For he clave to Jehovah; he departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.
2 Kings|18|7|And Jehovah was with him; whithersoever he went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
2 Kings|18|8|
2 Kings|18|9|And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
2 Kings|18|10|And at the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
2 Kings|18|11|And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
2 Kings|18|12|
2 Kings|18|13|Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
2 Kings|18|14|And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings|18|15|all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king’s house.
2 Kings|18|16|the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|17|And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army unto Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.
2 Kings|18|18|
2 Kings|18|19|And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
2 Kings|18|20|counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
2 Kings|18|21|Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
2 Kings|18|22|But if ye say unto me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
2 Kings|18|23|Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
2 Kings|18|24|How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
2 Kings|18|25|
2 Kings|18|26|Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not with us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
2 Kings|18|27|to the men that sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
2 Kings|18|28|Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spake, saying, Hear ye the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|29|Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
2 Kings|18|30|neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|18|31|Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
2 Kings|18|32|Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
2 Kings|18|33|Hath any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings|18|34|Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
2 Kings|18|35|
2 Kings|18|36|But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
2 Kings|18|37|
2 Kings|19|1|And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|2|And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
2 Kings|19|3|And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
2 Kings|19|4|It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
2 Kings|19|5|So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings|19|6|And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
2 Kings|19|7|Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2 Kings|19|8|So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
2 Kings|19|9|And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee, he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
2 Kings|19|10|Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2 Kings|19|11|Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
2 Kings|19|12|Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
2 Kings|19|13|
2 Kings|19|14|And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|15|the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
2 Kings|19|16|Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent him to defy the living God.
2 Kings|19|17|Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
2 Kings|19|18|and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
2 Kings|19|19|
2 Kings|19|20|.
2 Kings|19|21|This is the word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
2 Kings|19|22|against the Holy One of Israel.
2 Kings|19|23|By thy messengers thou hast defied the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir-trees thereof; and I will enter into his farthest lodging-place, the forest of his fruitful field.
2 Kings|19|24|
2 Kings|19|25|Hast thou not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be thine to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
2 Kings|19|26|Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.
2 Kings|19|27|But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.
2 Kings|19|28|
2 Kings|19|29|And this shall be the sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
2 Kings|19|30|And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
2 Kings|19|31|For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape: the zeal of Jehovah shall perform this.
2 Kings|19|32|Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
2 Kings|19|33|By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|19|34|
2 Kings|19|35|And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when men arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
2 Kings|19|36|So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
2 Kings|19|37|
2 Kings|20|1|In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
2 Kings|20|2|Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto Jehovah, saying,
2 Kings|20|3|Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
2 Kings|20|4|And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
2 Kings|20|5|Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the prince of my people, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|6|And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
2 Kings|20|7|
2 Kings|20|8|And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of Jehovah the third day?
2 Kings|20|9|And Isaiah said, This shall be the sign unto thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?
2 Kings|20|10|And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.
2 Kings|20|11|
2 Kings|20|12|At that time Berodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
2 Kings|20|13|And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
2 Kings|20|14|Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
2 Kings|20|15|
2 Kings|20|16|And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|17|Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|20|18|And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
2 Kings|20|19|Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
2 Kings|20|20|Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|20|21|
2 Kings|21|1|Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2 Kings|21|2|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, after the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah cast out before the children of Israel.
2 Kings|21|3|For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
2 Kings|21|4|And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, whereof Jehovah said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
2 Kings|21|5|And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|6|And he made his son to pass through the fire, and practised augury, and used enchantments, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
2 Kings|21|7|And he set the graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever;
2 Kings|21|8|neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
2 Kings|21|9|
2 Kings|21|10|And Jehovah spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
2 Kings|21|11|Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, that were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols;
2 Kings|21|12|therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
2 Kings|21|13|And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
2 Kings|21|14|And I will cast off the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
2 Kings|21|15|
2 Kings|21|16|Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|17|Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|21|18|
2 Kings|21|19|Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2 Kings|21|20|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did Manasseh his father.
2 Kings|21|21|And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
2 Kings|21|22|and he forsook Jehovah, the God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of Jehovah.
2 Kings|21|23|And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
2 Kings|21|24|But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
2 Kings|21|25|Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|21|26|
2 Kings|22|1|Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
2 Kings|22|2|
2 Kings|22|3|And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Jehovah, saying,
2 Kings|22|4|Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:
2 Kings|22|5|and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and let them give it to the workmen that are in the house of Jehovah, to repair the breaches of the house,
2 Kings|22|6|unto the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
2 Kings|22|7|
2 Kings|22|8|And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
2 Kings|22|9|And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|22|10|And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2 Kings|22|11|And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
2 Kings|22|12|And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
2 Kings|22|13|
2 Kings|22|14|So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.
2 Kings|22|15|And she said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent you unto me,
2 Kings|22|16|Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.
2 Kings|22|17|Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
2 Kings|22|18|But unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,
2 Kings|22|19|because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith Jehovah.
2 Kings|22|20|
2 Kings|23|1|And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|23|2|And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|23|3|
2 Kings|23|4|And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|5|And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
2 Kings|23|6|And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the common people.
2 Kings|23|7|And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
2 Kings|23|8|And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; and he brake down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.
2 Kings|23|9|Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they did eat unleavened bread among their brethren.
2 Kings|23|10|And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
2 Kings|23|11|And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
2 Kings|23|12|down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
2 Kings|23|13|And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
2 Kings|23|14|
2 Kings|23|15|Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he brake down; and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
2 Kings|23|16|And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
2 Kings|23|17|Then he said, What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|18|And he said, Let him be; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
2 Kings|23|19|to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
2 Kings|23|20|
2 Kings|23|21|And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto Jehovah your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
2 Kings|23|22|Surely there was not kept such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
2 Kings|23|23|
2 Kings|23|24|Moreover them that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
2 Kings|23|25|
2 Kings|23|26|Notwithstanding, Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked him.
2 Kings|23|27|
2 Kings|23|28|Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|23|29|slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
2 Kings|23|30|
2 Kings|23|31|Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|23|32|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings|23|33|And Pharaoh-necoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
2 Kings|23|34|And Pharaoh-necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died there.
2 Kings|23|35|
2 Kings|23|36|Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2 Kings|23|37|
2 Kings|24|1|In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
2 Kings|24|2|And Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah, which he spake by his servants the prophets.
2 Kings|24|3|Surely at the commandment of Jehovah came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,
2 Kings|24|4|and also for the innocent blood that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Jehovah would not pardon.
2 Kings|24|5|Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings|24|6|So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
2 Kings|24|7|
2 Kings|24|8|Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2 Kings|24|9|
2 Kings|24|10|At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
2 Kings|24|11|And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto the city, while his servants were besieging it;
2 Kings|24|12|and Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
2 Kings|24|13|And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had said.
2 Kings|24|14|And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
2 Kings|24|15|And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|16|And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths a thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
2 Kings|24|17|
2 Kings|24|18|Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 Kings|24|19|And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings|24|20|
2 Kings|25|1|And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
2 Kings|25|2|So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
2 Kings|25|3|month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
2 Kings|25|4|went by the way of the Arabah.
2 Kings|25|5|But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
2 Kings|25|6|Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
2 Kings|25|7|
2 Kings|25|8|Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem.
2 Kings|25|9|And he burnt the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.
2 Kings|25|10|the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
2 Kings|25|11|And the residue of the people that were left in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
2 Kings|25|12|
2 Kings|25|13|And the pillars of brass that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases and the brazen sea that were in the house of Jehovah, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
2 Kings|25|14|And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
2 Kings|25|15|And the firepans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
2 Kings|25|16|The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
2 Kings|25|17|
2 Kings|25|18|And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:
2 Kings|25|19|and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and five men of them that saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the city.
2 Kings|25|20|And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
2 Kings|25|21|
2 Kings|25|22|And as for the people that were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.
2 Kings|25|23|Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
2 Kings|25|24|And Gedaliah sware to them and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
2 Kings|25|25|But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
2 Kings|25|26|
2 Kings|25|27|And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
2 Kings|25|28|and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,
2 Kings|25|29|did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:
2 Kings|25|30|
Genesis|1|1|In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Genesis|1|2|And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Genesis|1|3|And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Genesis|1|4|And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
Genesis|1|5|
Genesis|1|6|And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
Genesis|1|7|And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
Genesis|1|8|
Genesis|1|9|And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
Genesis|1|10|And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|11|fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis|1|12|And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|13|
Genesis|1|14|And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
Genesis|1|15|and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis|1|16|the stars also.
Genesis|1|17|And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
Genesis|1|18|and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|19|
Genesis|1|20|And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
Genesis|1|21|And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|22|And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
Genesis|1|23|
Genesis|1|24|And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.
Genesis|1|25|And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
Genesis|1|26|And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Genesis|1|27|And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Genesis|1|28|And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Genesis|1|29|And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:
Genesis|1|30|every green herb for food: and it was so.
Genesis|1|31|
Genesis|2|1|And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Genesis|2|2|And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis|2|3|
Genesis|2|4|These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
Genesis|2|5|And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;
Genesis|2|6|but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Genesis|2|7|And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Genesis|2|8|And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis|2|9|And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis|2|10|And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
Genesis|2|11|The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
Genesis|2|12|and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
Genesis|2|13|And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
Genesis|2|14|And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis|2|15|And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
Genesis|2|16|And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
Genesis|2|17|
Genesis|2|18|And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.
Genesis|2|19|And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
Genesis|2|20|And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.
Genesis|2|21|And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:
Genesis|2|22|and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
Genesis|2|23|And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Genesis|2|24|Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
Genesis|2|25|
Genesis|3|1|Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?
Genesis|3|2|And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:
Genesis|3|3|but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
Genesis|3|4|And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
Genesis|3|5|for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
Genesis|3|6|And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
Genesis|3|7|And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
Genesis|3|8|
Genesis|3|9|And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?
Genesis|3|10|And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
Genesis|3|11|And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
Genesis|3|12|And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
Genesis|3|13|And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
Genesis|3|14|And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
Genesis|3|15|and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Genesis|3|16|Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
Genesis|3|17|And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
Genesis|3|18|thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
Genesis|3|19|in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
Genesis|3|20|And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Genesis|3|21|
Genesis|3|22|And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever—
Genesis|3|23|therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
Genesis|3|24|
Genesis|4|1|Jehovah.
Genesis|4|2|And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis|4|3|And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.
Genesis|4|4|And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
Genesis|4|5|but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
Genesis|4|6|And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
Genesis|4|7|If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.
Genesis|4|8|
Genesis|4|9|And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?
Genesis|4|10|And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.
Genesis|4|11|And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;
Genesis|4|12|when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
Genesis|4|13|And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Genesis|4|14|Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.
Genesis|4|15|
Genesis|4|16|And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
Genesis|4|17|And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
Genesis|4|18|And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.
Genesis|4|19|And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
Genesis|4|20|cattle.
Genesis|4|21|And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
Genesis|4|22|And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
Genesis|4|23|
Genesis|4|24|
Genesis|4|25|, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.
Genesis|4|26|
Genesis|5|1|This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
Genesis|5|2|male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
Genesis|5|3|in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
Genesis|5|4|and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|5|5|
Genesis|5|6|And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:
Genesis|5|7|and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|8|
Genesis|5|9|And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.
Genesis|5|10|and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|11|
Genesis|5|12|And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:
Genesis|5|13|and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|14|
Genesis|5|15|And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
Genesis|5|16|And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|17|
Genesis|5|18|And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:
Genesis|5|19|and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|20|
Genesis|5|21|And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
Genesis|5|22|and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|23|and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
Genesis|5|24|
Genesis|5|25|And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
Genesis|5|26|and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.
Genesis|5|27|
Genesis|5|28|And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
Genesis|5|29|because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.
Genesis|5|30|And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
Genesis|5|31|
Genesis|5|32|
Genesis|6|1|And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,
Genesis|6|2|that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
Genesis|6|3|And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
Genesis|6|4|
Genesis|6|5|And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Genesis|6|6|And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
Genesis|6|7|And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
Genesis|6|8|
Genesis|6|9|perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.
Genesis|6|10|And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis|6|11|And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
Genesis|6|12|
Genesis|6|13|And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Genesis|6|14|Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
Genesis|6|15|And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
Genesis|6|16|A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
Genesis|6|17|And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.
Genesis|6|18|But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
Genesis|6|19|And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Genesis|6|20|Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
Genesis|6|21|And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Genesis|6|22|
Genesis|7|1|And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
Genesis|7|2|Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:
Genesis|7|3|of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
Genesis|7|4|For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.
Genesis|7|5|
Genesis|7|6|And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
Genesis|7|7|And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Genesis|7|8|Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,
Genesis|7|9|there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
Genesis|7|10|And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
Genesis|7|11|In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
Genesis|7|12|
Genesis|7|13|In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
Genesis|7|14|they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
Genesis|7|15|And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
Genesis|7|16|And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.
Genesis|7|17|And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
Genesis|7|18|And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
Genesis|7|19|And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.
Genesis|7|20|Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Genesis|7|21|And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
Genesis|7|22|all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
Genesis|7|23|And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.
Genesis|7|24|
Genesis|8|1|And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;
Genesis|8|2|the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
Genesis|8|3|and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
Genesis|8|4|And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
Genesis|8|5|
Genesis|8|6|And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
Genesis|8|7|and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
Genesis|8|8|And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
Genesis|8|9|but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.
Genesis|8|10|And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
Genesis|8|11|and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
Genesis|8|12|
Genesis|8|13|And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.
Genesis|8|14|And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
Genesis|8|15|And God spake unto Noah, saying,
Genesis|8|16|Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
Genesis|8|17|Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
Genesis|8|18|And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:
Genesis|8|19|
Genesis|8|20|And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
Genesis|8|21|And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.
Genesis|8|22|
Genesis|9|1|And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
Genesis|9|2|And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
Genesis|9|3|Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.
Genesis|9|4|the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
Genesis|9|5|of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.
Genesis|9|6|Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
Genesis|9|7|
Genesis|9|8|And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
Genesis|9|9|And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
Genesis|9|10|and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
Genesis|9|11|And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
Genesis|9|12|And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
Genesis|9|13|I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
Genesis|9|14|And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
Genesis|9|15|and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Genesis|9|16|And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
Genesis|9|17|
Genesis|9|18|And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
Genesis|9|19|
Genesis|9|20|And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:
Genesis|9|21|and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent.
Genesis|9|22|And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Genesis|9|23|And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
Genesis|9|24|And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
Genesis|9|25|
Genesis|9|26|
Genesis|9|27|
Genesis|9|28|And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Genesis|9|29|
Genesis|10|1|
Genesis|10|2|The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
Genesis|10|3|And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
Genesis|10|4|And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
Genesis|10|5|
Genesis|10|6|And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
Genesis|10|7|And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
Genesis|10|8|And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Genesis|10|9|He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
Genesis|10|10|And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Genesis|10|11|Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,
Genesis|10|12|and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
Genesis|10|13|And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
Genesis|10|14|
Genesis|10|15|And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
Genesis|10|16|and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
Genesis|10|17|and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
Genesis|10|18|and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
Genesis|10|19|And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
Genesis|10|20|
Genesis|10|21|And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
Genesis|10|22|The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
Genesis|10|23|And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
Genesis|10|24|And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
Genesis|10|25|And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother’s name was Joktan.
Genesis|10|26|And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
Genesis|10|27|and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
Genesis|10|28|and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
Genesis|10|29|and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
Genesis|10|30|And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
Genesis|10|31|
Genesis|10|32|
Genesis|11|1|And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
Genesis|11|2|And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Genesis|11|3|And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
Genesis|11|4|unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Genesis|11|5|And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Genesis|11|6|And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
Genesis|11|7|Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
Genesis|11|8|So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
Genesis|11|9|
Genesis|11|10|These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Genesis|11|11|
Genesis|11|12|And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.
Genesis|11|13|
Genesis|11|14|And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
Genesis|11|15|
Genesis|11|16|And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
Genesis|11|17|
Genesis|11|18|And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
Genesis|11|19|
Genesis|11|20|And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
Genesis|11|21|
Genesis|11|22|And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
Genesis|11|23|
Genesis|11|24|And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
Genesis|11|25|
Genesis|11|26|
Genesis|11|27|Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.
Genesis|11|28|And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis|11|29|And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Genesis|11|30|And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
Genesis|11|31|And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
Genesis|11|32|
Genesis|12|1|Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee:
Genesis|12|2|and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing;
Genesis|12|3|and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|12|4|So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Genesis|12|5|And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Genesis|12|6|And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Genesis|12|7|And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.
Genesis|12|8|And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|12|9|
Genesis|12|10|And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|12|11|And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Genesis|12|12|and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Genesis|12|13|Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
Genesis|12|14|And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Genesis|12|15|And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis|12|16|And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
Genesis|12|17|And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
Genesis|12|18|And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Genesis|12|19|why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Genesis|12|20|
Genesis|13|1|And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
Genesis|13|2|And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Genesis|13|3|And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,
Genesis|13|4|unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
Genesis|13|5|And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Genesis|13|6|And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Genesis|13|7|And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
Genesis|13|8|And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.
Genesis|13|9|the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Genesis|13|10|And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.
Genesis|13|11|So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Genesis|13|12|Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
Genesis|13|13|
Genesis|13|14|And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
Genesis|13|15|for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Genesis|13|16|And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
Genesis|13|17|Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
Genesis|13|18|
Genesis|14|1|And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
Genesis|14|2|that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
Genesis|14|3|All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
Genesis|14|4|Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Genesis|14|5|And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
Genesis|14|6|and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
Genesis|14|7|And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
Genesis|14|8|And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
Genesis|14|9|against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
Genesis|14|10|Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Genesis|14|11|And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Genesis|14|12|
Genesis|14|13|And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
Genesis|14|14|And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
Genesis|14|15|And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Genesis|14|16|
Genesis|14|17|And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King’s Vale).
Genesis|14|18|And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
Genesis|14|19|And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
Genesis|14|20|and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
Genesis|14|21|And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Genesis|14|22|And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
Genesis|14|23|that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Genesis|14|24|
Genesis|15|1|thy exceeding great reward.
Genesis|15|2|And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
Genesis|15|3|And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis|15|4|And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Genesis|15|5|And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Genesis|15|6|And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
Genesis|15|7|And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Genesis|15|8|And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Genesis|15|9|And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
Genesis|15|10|And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
Genesis|15|11|
Genesis|15|12|And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Genesis|15|13|And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Genesis|15|14|and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Genesis|15|15|But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Genesis|15|16|And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
Genesis|15|17|And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
Genesis|15|18|In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Genesis|15|19|the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
Genesis|15|20|and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
Genesis|15|21|
Genesis|16|1|Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Genesis|16|2|And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Genesis|16|3|And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
Genesis|16|4|And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Genesis|16|5|And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee.
Genesis|16|6|
Genesis|16|7|And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Genesis|16|8|And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Genesis|16|9|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Genesis|16|10|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Genesis|16|11|And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.
Genesis|16|12|against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.
Genesis|16|13|And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
Genesis|16|14|
Genesis|16|15|And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Genesis|16|16|
Genesis|17|1|And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Genesis|17|2|And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Genesis|17|3|And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Genesis|17|4|As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
Genesis|17|5|Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
Genesis|17|6|And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Genesis|17|7|And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
Genesis|17|8|
Genesis|17|9|And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
Genesis|17|10|This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.
Genesis|17|11|And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
Genesis|17|12|And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
Genesis|17|13|He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Genesis|17|14|
Genesis|17|15|And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Genesis|17|16|nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
Genesis|17|17|Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Genesis|17|18|And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
Genesis|17|19|And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
Genesis|17|20|And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Genesis|17|21|
Genesis|17|22|And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Genesis|17|23|And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Genesis|17|24|And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|25|And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis|17|26|In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Genesis|17|27|
Genesis|18|1|And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Genesis|18|2|and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
Genesis|18|3|and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Genesis|18|4|let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Genesis|18|5|and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Genesis|18|6|And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
Genesis|18|7|And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
Genesis|18|8|
Genesis|18|9|And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Genesis|18|10|And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
Genesis|18|11|well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Genesis|18|12|And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Genesis|18|13|And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?
Genesis|18|14|Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
Genesis|18|15|
Genesis|18|16|And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Genesis|18|17|And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;
Genesis|18|18|seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Genesis|18|19|For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
Genesis|18|20|And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
Genesis|18|21|
Genesis|18|22|And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.
Genesis|18|23|And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
Genesis|18|24|Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Genesis|18|25|That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
Genesis|18|26|And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
Genesis|18|27|And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:
Genesis|18|28|peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
Genesis|18|29|And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.
Genesis|18|30|And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Genesis|18|31|And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.
Genesis|18|32|And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.
Genesis|18|33|
Genesis|19|1|And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;
Genesis|19|2|and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
Genesis|19|3|And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Genesis|19|4|the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
Genesis|19|5|and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Genesis|19|6|And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.
Genesis|19|7|And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
Genesis|19|8|Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.
Genesis|19|9|And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
Genesis|19|10|But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Genesis|19|11|
Genesis|19|12|And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:
Genesis|19|13|for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.
Genesis|19|14|And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
Genesis|19|15|And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
Genesis|19|16|But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Genesis|19|17|And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
Genesis|19|18|And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:
Genesis|19|19|behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:
Genesis|19|20|behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.
Genesis|19|21|And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
Genesis|19|22|
Genesis|19|23|The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
Genesis|19|24|Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;
Genesis|19|25|and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Genesis|19|26|But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Genesis|19|27|And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:
Genesis|19|28|
Genesis|19|29|
Genesis|19|30|And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Genesis|19|31|And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Genesis|19|32|come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis|19|33|And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis|19|34|And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Genesis|19|35|And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Genesis|19|36|Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Genesis|19|37|And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Genesis|19|38|
Genesis|20|1|And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.
Genesis|20|2|And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Genesis|20|3|But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a man’s wife.
Genesis|20|4|Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
Genesis|20|5|Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
Genesis|20|6|And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Genesis|20|7|
Genesis|20|8|And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid.
Genesis|20|9|Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
Genesis|20|10|And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
Genesis|20|11|And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
Genesis|20|12|And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:
Genesis|20|13|and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
Genesis|20|14|And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Genesis|20|15|And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee.
Genesis|20|16|And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted.
Genesis|20|17|And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children.
Genesis|20|18|
Genesis|21|1|And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Genesis|21|2|And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Genesis|21|3|And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Genesis|21|4|And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Genesis|21|5|And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Genesis|21|6|And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.
Genesis|21|7|
Genesis|21|8|And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
Genesis|21|9|And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
Genesis|21|10|Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
Genesis|21|11|And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.
Genesis|21|12|And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Genesis|21|13|And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
Genesis|21|14|the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
Genesis|21|15|And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Genesis|21|16|And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
Genesis|21|17|And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Genesis|21|18|Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation.
Genesis|21|19|And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Genesis|21|20|And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
Genesis|21|21|
Genesis|21|22|And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
Genesis|21|23|Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
Genesis|21|24|And Abraham said, I will swear.
Genesis|21|25|And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
Genesis|21|26|And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.
Genesis|21|27|And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant.
Genesis|21|28|And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Genesis|21|29|And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
Genesis|21|30|And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Genesis|21|31|Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them.
Genesis|21|32|So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Genesis|21|33|planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.
Genesis|21|34|
Genesis|22|1|And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis|22|2|And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
Genesis|22|3|And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Genesis|22|4|On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
Genesis|22|5|And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
Genesis|22|6|And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.
Genesis|22|7|And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?
Genesis|22|8|
Genesis|22|9|And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
Genesis|22|10|And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
Genesis|22|11|And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.
Genesis|22|12|And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
Genesis|22|13|a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
Genesis|22|14|And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.
Genesis|22|15|And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,
Genesis|22|16|and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
Genesis|22|17|that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.
Genesis|22|18|And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Genesis|22|19|
Genesis|22|20|And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor.
Genesis|22|21|Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.
Genesis|22|22|And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
Genesis|22|23|And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
Genesis|22|24|
Genesis|23|1|And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.
Genesis|23|2|And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
Genesis|23|3|And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,
Genesis|23|4|I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Genesis|23|5|And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis|23|6|Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
Genesis|23|7|And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
Genesis|23|8|And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
Genesis|23|9|that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.
Genesis|23|10|Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Genesis|23|11|Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead.
Genesis|23|12|And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
Genesis|23|13|And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
Genesis|23|14|And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Genesis|23|15|My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.
Genesis|23|16|
Genesis|23|17|So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure
Genesis|23|18|unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
Genesis|23|19|And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|23|20|
Genesis|24|1|well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.
Genesis|24|2|And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.
Genesis|24|3|And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
Genesis|24|4|But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
Genesis|24|5|And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
Genesis|24|6|And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
Genesis|24|7|Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
Genesis|24|8|And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
Genesis|24|9|
Genesis|24|10|And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
Genesis|24|11|And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
Genesis|24|12|And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
Genesis|24|13|Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
Genesis|24|14|And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.
Genesis|24|15|And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
Genesis|24|16|And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
Genesis|24|17|And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
Genesis|24|18|And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
Genesis|24|19|And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
Genesis|24|20|And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
Genesis|24|21|And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.
Genesis|24|22|And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
Genesis|24|23|and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?
Genesis|24|24|And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.
Genesis|24|25|She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
Genesis|24|26|And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.
Genesis|24|27|
Genesis|24|28|And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words.
Genesis|24|29|And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.
Genesis|24|30|And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
Genesis|24|31|And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
Genesis|24|32|And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
Genesis|24|33|And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
Genesis|24|34|And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
Genesis|24|35|And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.
Genesis|24|36|And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath.
Genesis|24|37|And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.
Genesis|24|38|But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
Genesis|24|39|And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
Genesis|24|40|And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house.
Genesis|24|41|Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
Genesis|24|42|And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go.
Genesis|24|43|Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink.
Genesis|24|44|And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master’s son.
Genesis|24|45|And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
Genesis|24|46|And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
Genesis|24|47|And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
Genesis|24|48|And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
Genesis|24|49|
Genesis|24|50|Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Genesis|24|51|Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Genesis|24|52|And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.
Genesis|24|53|And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
Genesis|24|54|And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
Genesis|24|55|days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.
Genesis|24|56|And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
Genesis|24|57|And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
Genesis|24|58|And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Genesis|24|59|And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
Genesis|24|60|
Genesis|24|61|And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
Genesis|24|62|And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.
Genesis|24|63|And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
Genesis|24|64|And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
Genesis|24|65|And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.
Genesis|24|66|And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
Genesis|24|67|
Genesis|25|1|And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
Genesis|25|2|And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
Genesis|25|3|And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
Genesis|25|4|And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Genesis|25|5|And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Genesis|25|6|But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
Genesis|25|7|And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Genesis|25|8|, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis|25|9|And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
Genesis|25|10|The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
Genesis|25|11|
Genesis|25|12|Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham.
Genesis|25|13|And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
Genesis|25|14|and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Genesis|25|15|Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
Genesis|25|16|These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.
Genesis|25|17|And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.
Genesis|25|18|
Genesis|25|19|And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begat Isaac.
Genesis|25|20|And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
Genesis|25|21|And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Genesis|25|22|And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
Genesis|25|23|
Genesis|25|24|And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis|25|25|And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.
Genesis|25|26|
Genesis|25|27|And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
Genesis|25|28|Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.
Genesis|25|29|And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
Genesis|25|30|. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
Genesis|25|31|And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.
Genesis|25|32|And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?
Genesis|25|33|And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Genesis|25|34|
Genesis|26|1|And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
Genesis|26|2|And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
Genesis|26|3|Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.
Genesis|26|4|And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|26|5|Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Genesis|26|6|And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
Genesis|26|7|, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon.
Genesis|26|8|And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
Genesis|26|9|And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
Genesis|26|10|And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
Genesis|26|11|
Genesis|26|12|And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.
Genesis|26|13|And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
Genesis|26|14|And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.
Genesis|26|15|Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
Genesis|26|16|And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we.
Genesis|26|17|
Genesis|26|18|And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
Genesis|26|19|And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
Genesis|26|20|And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
Genesis|26|21|And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
Genesis|26|22|
Genesis|26|23|And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
Genesis|26|24|And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
Genesis|26|25|
Genesis|26|26|Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
Genesis|26|27|And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
Genesis|26|28|And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
Genesis|26|29|that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.
Genesis|26|30|And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
Genesis|26|31|And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
Genesis|26|32|And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
Genesis|26|33|
Genesis|26|34|And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
Genesis|26|35|
Genesis|27|1|And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I.
Genesis|27|2|And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
Genesis|27|3|Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
Genesis|27|4|
Genesis|27|5|And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Genesis|27|6|And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Genesis|27|7|Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.
Genesis|27|8|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Genesis|27|9|Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth.
Genesis|27|10|And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
Genesis|27|11|And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Genesis|27|12|My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
Genesis|27|13|And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
Genesis|27|14|And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
Genesis|27|15|And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
Genesis|27|16|And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.
Genesis|27|17|
Genesis|27|18|And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?
Genesis|27|19|And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis|27|20|And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.
Genesis|27|21|And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
Genesis|27|22|And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Genesis|27|23|And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him.
Genesis|27|24|And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
Genesis|27|25|And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank.
Genesis|27|26|And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
Genesis|27|27|
Genesis|27|28|
Genesis|27|29|
Genesis|27|30|And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Genesis|27|31|And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Genesis|27|32|And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.
Genesis|27|33|he shall be blessed.
Genesis|27|34|When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
Genesis|27|35|And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.
Genesis|27|36|And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
Genesis|27|37|And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?
Genesis|27|38|And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis|27|39|
Genesis|27|40|
Genesis|27|41|And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob.
Genesis|27|42|to kill thee.
Genesis|27|43|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.
Genesis|27|44|And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away.
Genesis|27|45|
Genesis|27|46|
Genesis|28|1|And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis|28|2|Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
Genesis|28|3|And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples.
Genesis|28|4|And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.
Genesis|28|5|
Genesis|28|6|Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Genesis|28|7|And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.
Genesis|28|8|And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.
Genesis|28|9|
Genesis|28|10|And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
Genesis|28|11|And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
Genesis|28|12|And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Genesis|28|13|And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
Genesis|28|14|And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Genesis|28|15|And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
Genesis|28|16|And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not.
Genesis|28|17|
Genesis|28|18|And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
Genesis|28|19|And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first.
Genesis|28|20|And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Genesis|28|21|so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,
Genesis|28|22|
Genesis|29|1|Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
Genesis|29|2|And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well’s mouth was great.
Genesis|29|3|And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in its place.
Genesis|29|4|And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
Genesis|29|5|And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
Genesis|29|6|And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
Genesis|29|7|And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
Genesis|29|8|And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.
Genesis|29|9|While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep. For she kept them.
Genesis|29|10|And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
Genesis|29|11|And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Genesis|29|12|
Genesis|29|13|And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
Genesis|29|14|And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
Genesis|29|15|And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?
Genesis|29|16|And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Genesis|29|17|And Leah’s eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
Genesis|29|18|And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
Genesis|29|19|And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.
Genesis|29|20|
Genesis|29|21|And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
Genesis|29|22|And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
Genesis|29|23|And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her.
Genesis|29|24|And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
Genesis|29|25|And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
Genesis|29|26|And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.
Genesis|29|27|Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
Genesis|29|28|And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
Genesis|29|29|And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
Genesis|29|30|
Genesis|29|31|And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.
Genesis|29|32|And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me.
Genesis|29|33|also. And she called his name Simeon.
Genesis|29|34|And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.
Genesis|29|35|
Genesis|30|1|And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
Genesis|30|2|And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
Genesis|30|3|And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.
Genesis|30|4|And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
Genesis|30|5|And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
Genesis|30|6|And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
Genesis|30|7|And Bilhah Rachel’s handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis|30|8|
Genesis|30|9|When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.
Genesis|30|10|And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bare Jacob a son.
Genesis|30|11|And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.
Genesis|30|12|And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bare Jacob a second son.
Genesis|30|13|
Genesis|30|14|And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|15|And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.
Genesis|30|16|And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
Genesis|30|17|And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
Genesis|30|18|And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
Genesis|30|19|And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
Genesis|30|20|And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
Genesis|30|21|And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
Genesis|30|22|And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
Genesis|30|23|And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
Genesis|30|24|
Genesis|30|25|And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Genesis|30|26|Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.
Genesis|30|27|I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.
Genesis|30|28|And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
Genesis|30|29|And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
Genesis|30|30|For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
Genesis|30|31|And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
Genesis|30|32|shall be my hire.
Genesis|30|33|with me, shall be counted stolen.
Genesis|30|34|And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
Genesis|30|35|And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
Genesis|30|36|
Genesis|30|37|And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
Genesis|30|38|And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
Genesis|30|39|And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis|30|40|And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock.
Genesis|30|41|And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
Genesis|30|42|but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
Genesis|30|43|
Genesis|31|1|And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.
Genesis|31|2|And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
Genesis|31|3|And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
Genesis|31|4|And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
Genesis|31|5|and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Genesis|31|6|And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Genesis|31|7|And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Genesis|31|8|If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
Genesis|31|9|Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
Genesis|31|10|And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
Genesis|31|11|And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
Genesis|31|12|And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Genesis|31|13|I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
Genesis|31|14|And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Genesis|31|15|Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
Genesis|31|16|
Genesis|31|17|Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
Genesis|31|18|and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
Genesis|31|19|Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.
Genesis|31|20|And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
Genesis|31|21|
Genesis|31|22|And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Genesis|31|23|And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|24|And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|25|And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
Genesis|31|26|And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
Genesis|31|27|Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
Genesis|31|28|and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
Genesis|31|29|It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Genesis|31|30|wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
Genesis|31|31|And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
Genesis|31|32|
Genesis|31|33|And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
Genesis|31|34|Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
Genesis|31|35|
Genesis|31|36|And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Genesis|31|37|Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
Genesis|31|38|These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
Genesis|31|39|That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Genesis|31|40|Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
Genesis|31|41|These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Genesis|31|42|
Genesis|31|43|And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?
Genesis|31|44|And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
Genesis|31|45|And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Genesis|31|46|And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
Genesis|31|47|And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Genesis|31|48|And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
Genesis|31|49|and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
Genesis|31|50|If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|51|And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
Genesis|31|52|This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Genesis|31|53|The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.
Genesis|31|54|And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
Genesis|31|55|
Genesis|32|1|And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Genesis|32|2|
Genesis|32|3|And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
Genesis|32|4|And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
Genesis|32|5|flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
Genesis|32|6|And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Genesis|32|7|Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
Genesis|32|8|and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
Genesis|32|9|And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
Genesis|32|10|I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
Genesis|32|11|Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
Genesis|32|12|
Genesis|32|13|And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
Genesis|32|14|two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis|32|15|thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
Genesis|32|16|And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Genesis|32|17|And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
Genesis|32|18|thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
Genesis|32|19|And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
Genesis|32|20|and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
Genesis|32|21|
Genesis|32|22|And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
Genesis|32|23|And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
Genesis|32|24|And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Genesis|32|25|And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
Genesis|32|26|And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Genesis|32|27|And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
Genesis|32|28|And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
Genesis|32|29|And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
Genesis|32|30|, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
Genesis|32|31|And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
Genesis|32|32|
Genesis|33|1|And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
Genesis|33|2|And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
Genesis|33|3|And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Genesis|33|4|And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
Genesis|33|5|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
Genesis|33|6|Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|7|And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Genesis|33|8|And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|9|And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
Genesis|33|10|And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Genesis|33|11|Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
Genesis|33|12|And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
Genesis|33|13|And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
Genesis|33|14|Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
Genesis|33|15|And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
Genesis|33|16|So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Genesis|33|17|
Genesis|33|18|And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
Genesis|33|19|And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
Genesis|33|20|
Genesis|34|1|And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Genesis|34|2|And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
Genesis|34|3|And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
Genesis|34|4|And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|5|Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
Genesis|34|6|And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Genesis|34|7|And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
Genesis|34|8|And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.
Genesis|34|9|And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
Genesis|34|10|And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
Genesis|34|11|And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Genesis|34|12|Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
Genesis|34|13|And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
Genesis|34|14|and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.
Genesis|34|15|Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
Genesis|34|16|then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
Genesis|34|17|
Genesis|34|18|And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
Genesis|34|19|And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
Genesis|34|20|And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
Genesis|34|21|These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Genesis|34|22|Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Genesis|34|23|Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
Genesis|34|24|And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
Genesis|34|25|And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
Genesis|34|26|And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.
Genesis|34|27|The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Genesis|34|28|They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
Genesis|34|29|and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
Genesis|34|30|And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
Genesis|34|31|
Genesis|35|1|And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Genesis|35|2|Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
Genesis|35|3|and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
Genesis|35|4|And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Genesis|35|5|And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
Genesis|35|6|So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
Genesis|35|7|And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Genesis|35|8|
Genesis|35|9|And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
Genesis|35|10|And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
Genesis|35|11|And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Genesis|35|12|and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
Genesis|35|13|And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
Genesis|35|14|And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
Genesis|35|15|
Genesis|35|16|And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
Genesis|35|17|And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
Genesis|35|18|And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
Genesis|35|19|And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
Genesis|35|20|And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
Genesis|35|21|And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
Genesis|35|22|Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Genesis|35|23|The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
Genesis|35|24|the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
Genesis|35|25|and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
Genesis|35|26|and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
Genesis|35|27|
Genesis|35|28|And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
Genesis|35|29|
Genesis|36|1|Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
Genesis|36|2|Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
Genesis|36|3|and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis|36|4|And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;
Genesis|36|5|and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|36|6|And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis|36|7|For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.
Genesis|36|8|
Genesis|36|9|And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
Genesis|36|10|these are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.

Genesis|37|1|And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|37|2|These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.
Genesis|37|3|Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
Genesis|37|4|
Genesis|37|5|And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
Genesis|37|6|And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
Genesis|37|7|for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
Genesis|37|8|And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
Genesis|37|9|And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
Genesis|37|10|And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
Genesis|37|11|
Genesis|37|12|And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
Genesis|37|13|And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
Genesis|37|14|And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Genesis|37|15|And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
Genesis|37|16|.
Genesis|37|17|
Genesis|37|18|And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
Genesis|37|19|And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
Genesis|37|20|Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
Genesis|37|21|And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
Genesis|37|22|And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
Genesis|37|23|And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
Genesis|37|24|
Genesis|37|25|And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
Genesis|37|26|And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
Genesis|37|27|Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.
Genesis|37|28|
Genesis|37|29|And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
Genesis|37|30|And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
Genesis|37|31|And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;
Genesis|37|32|and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.
Genesis|37|33|And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
Genesis|37|34|And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
Genesis|37|35|And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
Genesis|37|36|
Genesis|38|1|And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis|38|2|And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her.
Genesis|38|3|And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
Genesis|38|4|And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
Genesis|38|5|And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
Genesis|38|6|And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.
Genesis|38|7|And Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him.
Genesis|38|8|And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
Genesis|38|9|And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
Genesis|38|10|And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.
Genesis|38|11|
Genesis|38|12|And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Genesis|38|13|And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
Genesis|38|14|And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.
Genesis|38|15|When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.
Genesis|38|16|And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
Genesis|38|17|And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
Genesis|38|18|And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
Genesis|38|19|And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Genesis|38|20|And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.
Genesis|38|21|Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.
Genesis|38|22|And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.
Genesis|38|23|
Genesis|38|24|And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
Genesis|38|25|When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.
Genesis|38|26|And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
Genesis|38|27|And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
Genesis|38|28|And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
Genesis|38|29|And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.
Genesis|38|30|
Genesis|39|1|And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.
Genesis|39|2|And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
Genesis|39|3|And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Genesis|39|4|And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
Genesis|39|5|And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
Genesis|39|6|with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.
Genesis|39|7|And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
Genesis|39|8|But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:
Genesis|39|9|he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
Genesis|39|10|to be with her.
Genesis|39|11|And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
Genesis|39|12|And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis|39|13|And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
Genesis|39|14|that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
Genesis|39|15|and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
Genesis|39|16|And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
Genesis|39|17|And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
Genesis|39|18|
Genesis|39|19|And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
Genesis|39|20|And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
Genesis|39|21|But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Genesis|39|22|And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
Genesis|39|23|
Genesis|40|1|And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
Genesis|40|2|And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
Genesis|40|3|And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
Genesis|40|4|And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
Genesis|40|5|And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
Genesis|40|6|And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
Genesis|40|7|And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in ward in his master’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?
Genesis|40|8|
Genesis|40|9|And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
Genesis|40|10|the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
Genesis|40|11|and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
Genesis|40|12|And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
Genesis|40|13|within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
Genesis|40|14|But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
Genesis|40|15|
Genesis|40|16|When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:
Genesis|40|17|and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
Genesis|40|18|And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
Genesis|40|19|within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
Genesis|40|20|And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
Genesis|40|21|And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
Genesis|40|22|but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Genesis|40|23|
Genesis|41|1|And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
Genesis|41|2|And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.
Genesis|41|3|And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
Genesis|41|4|And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
Genesis|41|5|And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
Genesis|41|6|And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
Genesis|41|7|And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
Genesis|41|8|
Genesis|41|9|Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
Genesis|41|10|Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:
Genesis|41|11|and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
Genesis|41|12|And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
Genesis|41|13|
Genesis|41|14|Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|15|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.
Genesis|41|16|And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
Genesis|41|17|And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:
Genesis|41|18|and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:
Genesis|41|19|and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
Genesis|41|20|and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Genesis|41|21|and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Genesis|41|22|And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:
Genesis|41|23|blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
Genesis|41|24|
Genesis|41|25|And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|26|The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
Genesis|41|27|And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.
Genesis|41|28|That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|41|29|Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
Genesis|41|30|and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Genesis|41|31|and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
Genesis|41|32|And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Genesis|41|33|Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|34|, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
Genesis|41|35|And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
Genesis|41|36|
Genesis|41|37|And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
Genesis|41|38|And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
Genesis|41|39|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:
Genesis|41|40|thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
Genesis|41|41|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|42|And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
Genesis|41|43|and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|44|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|45|
Genesis|41|46|And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|47|And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Genesis|41|48|And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
Genesis|41|49|And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
Genesis|41|50|And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.
Genesis|41|51|, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.
Genesis|41|52|And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Genesis|41|53|And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
Genesis|41|54|And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Genesis|41|55|And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
Genesis|41|56|And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
Genesis|41|57|
Genesis|42|1|Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
Genesis|42|2|And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
Genesis|42|3|And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
Genesis|42|4|But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.
Genesis|42|5|And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|6|And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
Genesis|42|7|And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Genesis|42|8|And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
Genesis|42|9|And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|10|And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
Genesis|42|11|We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
Genesis|42|12|And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Genesis|42|13|And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
Genesis|42|14|And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
Genesis|42|15|hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Genesis|42|16|Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
Genesis|42|17|
Genesis|42|18|And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:
Genesis|42|19|if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:
Genesis|42|20|and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
Genesis|42|21|And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
Genesis|42|22|And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
Genesis|42|23|And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
Genesis|42|24|And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
Genesis|42|25|
Genesis|42|26|And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
Genesis|42|27|And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
Genesis|42|28|And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
Genesis|42|29|And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
Genesis|42|30|The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
Genesis|42|31|And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:
Genesis|42|32|we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
Genesis|42|33|the famine of your houses, and go your way;
Genesis|42|34|
Genesis|42|35|And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
Genesis|42|36|And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
Genesis|42|37|And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
Genesis|42|38|
Genesis|43|1|And the famine was sore in the land.
Genesis|43|2|And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis|43|3|And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|4|If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
Genesis|43|5|but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Genesis|43|6|And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
Genesis|43|7|brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Genesis|43|8|And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
Genesis|43|9|I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
Genesis|43|10|for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
Genesis|43|11|And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
Genesis|43|12|and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
Genesis|43|13|take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Genesis|43|14|and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Genesis|43|15|And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Genesis|43|16|And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
Genesis|43|17|And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.
Genesis|43|18|And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
Genesis|43|19|And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,
Genesis|43|20|and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
Genesis|43|21|and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
Genesis|43|22|And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
Genesis|43|23|And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
Genesis|43|24|And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.
Genesis|43|25|
Genesis|43|26|And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
Genesis|43|27|And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
Genesis|43|28|And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
Genesis|43|29|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
Genesis|43|30|And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
Genesis|43|31|And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
Genesis|43|32|And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Genesis|43|33|And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.
Genesis|43|34|
Genesis|44|1|And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
Genesis|44|2|And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Genesis|44|3|As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Genesis|44|4|when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Genesis|44|5|Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Genesis|44|6|And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
Genesis|44|7|And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
Genesis|44|8|Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
Genesis|44|9|With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
Genesis|44|10|And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.
Genesis|44|11|Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Genesis|44|12|began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Genesis|44|13|
Genesis|44|14|And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Genesis|44|15|And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
Genesis|44|16|And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
Genesis|44|17|
Genesis|44|18|Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
Genesis|44|19|My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
Genesis|44|20|And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.
Genesis|44|21|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
Genesis|44|22|And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
Genesis|44|23|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
Genesis|44|24|And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Genesis|44|25|And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
Genesis|44|26|And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, expect our youngest brother be with us.
Genesis|44|27|And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
Genesis|44|28|and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
Genesis|44|29|and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|44|30|Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;
Genesis|44|31|, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
Genesis|44|32|For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.
Genesis|44|33|Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
Genesis|44|34|
Genesis|45|1|Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
Genesis|45|2|And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Genesis|45|3|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
Genesis|45|4|And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Genesis|45|5|And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Genesis|45|6|For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
Genesis|45|7|And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
Genesis|45|8|So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis|45|9|Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;
Genesis|45|10|and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Genesis|45|11|and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.
Genesis|45|12|And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Genesis|45|13|And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
Genesis|45|14|And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Genesis|45|15|And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
Genesis|45|16|And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
Genesis|45|17|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Genesis|45|18|and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Genesis|45|19|Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Genesis|45|20|
Genesis|45|21|And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
Genesis|45|22|To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
Genesis|45|23|And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
Genesis|45|24|So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
Genesis|45|25|And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.
Genesis|45|26|And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.
Genesis|45|27|And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
Genesis|45|28|
Genesis|46|1|And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
Genesis|46|2|And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
Genesis|46|3|And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
Genesis|46|4|I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
Genesis|46|5|And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Genesis|46|6|And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
Genesis|46|7|
Genesis|46|8|And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born.
Genesis|46|9|And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
Genesis|46|10|And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
Genesis|46|11|And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis|46|12|And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis|46|13|And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.
Genesis|46|14|And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis|46|15|These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
Genesis|46|16|And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis|46|17|And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.
Genesis|46|18|These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
Genesis|46|19|The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis|46|20|And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.
Genesis|46|21|And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
Genesis|46|22|These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
Genesis|46|23|And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
Genesis|46|24|And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
Genesis|46|25|These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
Genesis|46|26|All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
Genesis|46|27|
Genesis|46|28|And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Genesis|46|29|And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Genesis|46|30|And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.
Genesis|46|31|And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Genesis|46|32|and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Genesis|46|33|And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
Genesis|46|34|
Genesis|47|1|Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|47|2|And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|3|And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
Genesis|47|4|And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’ flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|47|5|And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Genesis|47|6|the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Genesis|47|7|And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|8|And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
Genesis|47|9|And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Genesis|47|10|And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
Genesis|47|11|And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis|47|12|
Genesis|47|13|And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Genesis|47|14|And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
Genesis|47|15|money faileth.
Genesis|47|16|And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
Genesis|47|17|And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
Genesis|47|18|And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Genesis|47|19|
Genesis|47|20|So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh’s.
Genesis|47|21|And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
Genesis|47|22|Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.
Genesis|47|23|Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Genesis|47|24|And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Genesis|47|25|And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.
Genesis|47|26|
Genesis|47|27|And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
Genesis|47|28|And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.
Genesis|47|29|And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;
Genesis|47|30|but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Genesis|47|31|
Genesis|48|1|And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis|48|2|And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Genesis|48|3|And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis|48|4|and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Genesis|48|5|And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
Genesis|48|6|And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Genesis|48|7|
Genesis|48|8|And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?
Genesis|48|9|And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Genesis|48|10|Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Genesis|48|11|And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.
Genesis|48|12|And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Genesis|48|13|And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Genesis|48|14|And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.
Genesis|48|15|And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,
Genesis|48|16|the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Genesis|48|17|And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
Genesis|48|18|And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
Genesis|48|19|. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Genesis|48|20|And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis|48|21|And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

Genesis|49|29|And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Genesis|49|30|in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
Genesis|49|31|there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:
Genesis|49|32|the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
Genesis|49|33|
Genesis|50|1|And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
Genesis|50|2|And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Genesis|50|3|
Genesis|50|4|And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Genesis|50|5|My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
Genesis|50|6|And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
Genesis|50|7|And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis|50|8|and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
Genesis|50|9|And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
Genesis|50|10|And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
Genesis|50|11|And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
Genesis|50|12|And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
Genesis|50|13|for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
Genesis|50|14|
Genesis|50|15|And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
Genesis|50|16|And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
Genesis|50|17|So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Genesis|50|18|And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
Genesis|50|19|And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Genesis|50|20|And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Genesis|50|21|
Genesis|50|22|And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
Genesis|50|23|And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.
Genesis|50|24|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Genesis|50|25|And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
Genesis|50|26|
1 Peter|1|1|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
1 Peter|1|2|according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
1 Peter|1|3|the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1 Peter|1|4|unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
1 Peter|1|5|who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1 Peter|1|6|Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold trials,
1 Peter|1|7|more precious than gold that perisheth though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
1 Peter|1|8|whom not having seen ye love; on whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
1 Peter|1|9|souls.
1 Peter|1|10|unto you:
1 Peter|1|11|or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.
1 Peter|1|12|To whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced unto you through them that preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angel desire to look into.
1 Peter|1|13|Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
1 Peter|1|14|your ignorance:
1 Peter|1|15|but like as he who called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living;
1 Peter|1|16|because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy.
1 Peter|1|17|And if ye call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to each man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear:
1 Peter|1|18|knowing that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers;
1 Peter|1|19|of Christ:
1 Peter|1|20|who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of times for your sake,
1 Peter|1|21|who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.
1 Peter|1|22|Seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren, love one another from the heart fervently:
1 Peter|1|23|having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth.
1 Peter|1|24|For, All flesh is as grass, And all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth:
1 Peter|1|25|
1 Peter|2|1|Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
1 Peter|2|2|as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;
1 Peter|2|3|if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:
1 Peter|2|4|unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,
1 Peter|2|5|ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1 Peter|2|6|
1 Peter|2|7|
1 Peter|2|8|for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
1 Peter|2|9|own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
1 Peter|2|10|who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
1 Peter|2|11|Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;
1 Peter|2|12|having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
1 Peter|2|13|Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;
1 Peter|2|14|or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.
1 Peter|2|15|For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
1 Peter|2|16|as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.
1 Peter|2|17|Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
1 Peter|2|18|in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
1 Peter|2|19|For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.
1 Peter|2|20|, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.
1 Peter|2|21|For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:
1 Peter|2|22|who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
1 Peter|2|23|to him that judgeth righteously:
1 Peter|2|24|who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
1 Peter|2|25|
1 Peter|3|1|in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;
1 Peter|3|2|with fear.
1 Peter|3|3|let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;
1 Peter|3|4|of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.
1 Peter|3|5|For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:
1 Peter|3|6|as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
1 Peter|3|7|according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.
1 Peter|3|8|ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:
1 Peter|3|9|not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
1 Peter|3|10|
1 Peter|3|11|
1 Peter|3|12|
1 Peter|3|13|And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?
1 Peter|3|14|and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;
1 Peter|3|15|ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:
1 Peter|3|16|having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.
1 Peter|3|17|For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
1 Peter|3|18|Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
1 Peter|3|19|in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,
1 Peter|3|20|that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
1 Peter|3|21|baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;
1 Peter|3|22|
1 Peter|4|1|Forasmuch then as Christ suffered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves also with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
1 Peter|4|2|that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
1 Peter|4|3|For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:
1 Peter|4|4|:
1 Peter|4|5|who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1 Peter|4|6|For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
1 Peter|4|7|But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer:
1 Peter|4|8|above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves; for love covereth a multitude of sins:
1 Peter|4|9|using hospitality one to another without murmuring:
1 Peter|4|10|according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;
1 Peter|4|11|as of the strength which God supplieth: that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter|4|12|Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:
1 Peter|4|13|but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.
1 Peter|4|14|of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.
1 Peter|4|15|For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters:
1 Peter|4|16|as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.
1 Peter|4|17|the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?
1 Peter|4|18|And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?
1 Peter|4|19|
1 Peter|5|1|The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
1 Peter|5|2|God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
1 Peter|5|3|neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.
1 Peter|5|4|And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
1 Peter|5|5|Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
1 Peter|5|6|Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;
1 Peter|5|7|casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.
1 Peter|5|8|Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour,
1 Peter|5|9|whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
1 Peter|5|10|And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
1 Peter|5|11|the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Peter|5|12|, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand ye fast therein.
1 Peter|5|13|Mark my son.
1 Peter|5|14|
James|1|1|James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.
James|1|2|Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;
James|1|3|Knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.
James|1|4|perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.
James|1|5|But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
James|1|6|But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.
James|1|7|For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;
James|1|8|a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.
James|1|9|But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:
James|1|10|and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
James|1|11|For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass: and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.
James|1|12|promised to them that love him.
James|1|13|Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:
James|1|14|but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
James|1|15|Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.
James|1|16|Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.
James|1|17|Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.
James|1|18|Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
James|1|19|, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
James|1|20|for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
James|1|21|Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
James|1|22|But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.
James|1|23|For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:
James|1|24|for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
James|1|25|continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.
James|1|26|If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man’s religion is vain.
James|1|27|
James|2|1|of glory, with respect of persons.
James|2|2|For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;
James|2|3|and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;
James|2|4|Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
James|2|5|rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?
James|2|6|But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?
James|2|7|Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?
James|2|8|Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:
James|2|9|but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
James|2|10|, he is become guilty of all.
James|2|11|For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
James|2|12|So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.
James|2|13|without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.
James|2|14|What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?
James|2|15|If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,
James|2|16|and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?
James|2|17|Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
James|2|18|faith.
James|2|19|Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
James|2|20|But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?
James|2|21|Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
James|2|22|Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;
James|2|23|and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.
James|2|24|Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
James|2|25|And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
James|2|26|
James|3|1|teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.
James|3|2|For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
James|3|3|Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.
James|3|4|Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.
James|3|5|So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!
James|3|6|And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.
James|3|7|For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind.
James|3|8|full of deadly poison.
James|3|9|Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:
James|3|10|out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
James|3|11|and bitter?
James|3|12|salt water yield sweet.
James|3|13|Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.
James|3|14|But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.
James|3|15|that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
James|3|16|For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.
James|3|17|But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.
James|3|18|
James|4|1|of your pleasures that war in your members?
James|4|2|Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.
James|4|3|in your pleasures.
James|4|4|Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.
James|4|5|Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?
James|4|6|saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
James|4|7|Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
James|4|8|Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.
James|4|9|Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
James|4|10|Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.
James|4|11|Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
James|4|12|he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?
James|4|13|Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain:
James|4|14|whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
James|4|15|For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall both live, and do this or that.
James|4|16|But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.
James|4|17|
James|5|1|Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.
James|5|2|Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
James|5|3|Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.
James|5|4|Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.
James|5|5|Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James|5|6|; he doth not resist you.
James|5|7|Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain.
James|5|8|Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
James|5|9|Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.
James|5|10|Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spake in the name of the Lord.
James|5|11|Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.
James|5|12|But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.
James|5|13|Is any among you suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.
James|5|14|Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James|5|15|and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.
James|5|16|Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.
James|5|17|Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.
James|5|18|And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
James|5|19|My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;
James|5|20|
1 Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;
1 Timothy|1|2|unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1 Timothy|1|3|As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,
1 Timothy|1|4|.
1 Timothy|1|5|But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:
1 Timothy|1|6|from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;
1 Timothy|1|7|desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.
1 Timothy|1|8|But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,
1 Timothy|1|9|as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
1 Timothy|1|10|for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;
1 Timothy|1|11|according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1 Timothy|1|12|service;
1 Timothy|1|13|though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;
1 Timothy|1|14|and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy|1|15|Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:
1 Timothy|1|16|howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.
1 Timothy|1|17|honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
1 Timothy|1|18|This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;
1 Timothy|1|19|holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:
1 Timothy|1|20|
1 Timothy|2|1|I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
1 Timothy|2|2|for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
1 Timothy|2|3|This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1 Timothy|2|4|who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy|2|5|man, Christ Jesus,
1 Timothy|2|6|in its own times;
1 Timothy|2|7|whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
1 Timothy|2|8|I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
1 Timothy|2|9|In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;
1 Timothy|2|10|but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.
1 Timothy|2|11|Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
1 Timothy|2|12|But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
1 Timothy|2|13|For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
1 Timothy|2|14|and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:
1 Timothy|2|15|
1 Timothy|3|1|Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
1 Timothy|3|2|The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1 Timothy|3|3|no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;
1 Timothy|3|4|children in subjection with all gravity;
1 Timothy|3|5|(but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
1 Timothy|3|6|not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1 Timothy|3|7|Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1 Timothy|3|8|grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
1 Timothy|3|9|holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy|3|10|And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.
1 Timothy|3|11|grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
1 Timothy|3|12|children and their own houses well.
1 Timothy|3|13|For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy|3|14|These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly;
1 Timothy|3|15|but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
1 Timothy|3|16|
1 Timothy|4|1|But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,
1 Timothy|4|2|through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
1 Timothy|4|3|to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy|4|4|For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:
1 Timothy|4|5|for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy|4|6|:
1 Timothy|4|7|but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:
1 Timothy|4|8|for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.
1 Timothy|4|9|Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.
1 Timothy|4|10|For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.
1 Timothy|4|11|These things command and teach.
1 Timothy|4|12|Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.
1 Timothy|4|13|Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
1 Timothy|4|14|Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
1 Timothy|4|15|Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.
1 Timothy|4|16|
1 Timothy|5|1|Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:
1 Timothy|5|2|the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
1 Timothy|5|3|Honor widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy|5|4|But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
1 Timothy|5|5|Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
1 Timothy|5|6|But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1 Timothy|5|7|These things also command, that they may be without reproach.
1 Timothy|5|8|But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.
1 Timothy|5|9|the wife of one man,
1 Timothy|5|10|well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.
1 Timothy|5|11|But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;
1 Timothy|5|12|having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge.
1 Timothy|5|13|idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
1 Timothy|5|14|marry, bear children, rule the household, give no occasion to the adversary for reviling:
1 Timothy|5|15|for already some are turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy|5|16|If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy|5|17|Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.
1 Timothy|5|18|For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his hire.
1 Timothy|5|19|two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy|5|20|Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.
1 Timothy|5|21|in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.
1 Timothy|5|22|Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.
1 Timothy|5|23|Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.
1 Timothy|5|24|Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.
1 Timothy|5|25|
1 Timothy|6|1|Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine be not blasphemed.
1 Timothy|6|2|And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. These things teach and exhort.
1 Timothy|6|3|the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
1 Timothy|6|4|he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but doting about questionings and disputes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1 Timothy|6|5|wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.
1 Timothy|6|6|But godliness with contentment is great gain:
1 Timothy|6|7|for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out;
1 Timothy|6|8|but having food and covering we shall be therewith content.
1 Timothy|6|9|But they that are minded to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition.
1 Timothy|6|10|For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil: which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1 Timothy|6|11|But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
1 Timothy|6|12|Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, whereunto thou wast called, and didst confess the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.
1 Timothy|6|13|I charge thee in the sight of God, who giveth life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession;
1 Timothy|6|14|that thou keep the commandment, without spot, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Timothy|6|15|which in its own times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1 Timothy|6|16|honor and power eternal. Amen.
1 Timothy|6|17|Charge them that are rich in this present world, that they be not highminded, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
1 Timothy|6|18|that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1 Timothy|6|19|indeed.
1 Timothy|6|20|, turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called;
1 Timothy|6|21|
2 Thessalonians|1|1|Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;
2 Thessalonians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|1|3|We are bound to give thanks to God always to you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith growth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth;
2 Thessalonians|1|4|so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;
2 Thessalonians|1|5|a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
2 Thessalonians|1|6|if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you,
2 Thessalonians|1|7|and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,
2 Thessalonians|1|8|rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus:
2 Thessalonians|1|9|eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
2 Thessalonians|1|10|when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.
2 Thessalonians|1|11|work of faith, with power;
2 Thessalonians|1|12|
2 Thessalonians|2|1|Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;
2 Thessalonians|2|2|to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;
2 Thessalonians|2|3|except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
2 Thessalonians|2|4|he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.
2 Thessalonians|2|5|Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians|2|6|And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
2 Thessalonians|2|7|one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians|2|8|And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;
2 Thessalonians|2|9|, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
2 Thessalonians|2|10|and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2 Thessalonians|2|11|And for this cause God sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie:
2 Thessalonians|2|12|that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians|2|13|But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, for that God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
2 Thessalonians|2|14|whereunto he called you through our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians|2|15|So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
2 Thessalonians|2|16|Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians|2|17|
2 Thessalonians|3|1|with you;
2 Thessalonians|3|2|and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.
2 Thessalonians|3|3|.
2 Thessalonians|3|4|And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.
2 Thessalonians|3|5|And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
2 Thessalonians|3|6|Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.
2 Thessalonians|3|7|For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians|3|8|neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:
2 Thessalonians|3|9|not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.
2 Thessalonians|3|10|For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.
2 Thessalonians|3|11|For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.
2 Thessalonians|3|12|Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians|3|13|But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.
2 Thessalonians|3|14|And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians|3|15|count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2 Thessalonians|3|16|Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians|3|17|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
2 Thessalonians|3|18|
Mark|1|1|The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Mark|1|2|Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.
Mark|1|3|The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;
Mark|1|4|John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.
Mark|1|5|And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Mark|1|6|a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.
Mark|1|7|And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
Mark|1|8|I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
Mark|1|9|And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
Mark|1|10|And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:
Mark|1|11|And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.
Mark|1|12|And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.
Mark|1|13|And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.
Mark|1|14|Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
Mark|1|15|and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.
Mark|1|16|And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.
Mark|1|17|And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
Mark|1|18|And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.
Mark|1|19|of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.
Mark|1|20|And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
Mark|1|21|And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
Mark|1|22|And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
Mark|1|23|And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
Mark|1|24|saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
Mark|1|25|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
Mark|1|26|And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark|1|27|And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
Mark|1|28|And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
Mark|1|29|And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Mark|1|30|Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:
Mark|1|31|and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
Mark|1|32|And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.
Mark|1|33|And all the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark|1|34|And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
Mark|1|35|And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.
Mark|1|36|And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
Mark|1|37|and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.
Mark|1|38|And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.
Mark|1|39|And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
Mark|1|40|And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark|1|41|And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.
Mark|1|42|And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
Mark|1|43|And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,
Mark|1|44|and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|1|45|
Mark|2|1|And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark|2|2|, no, not even about the door: and he spake the word unto them.
Mark|2|3|And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.
Mark|2|4|And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.
Mark|2|5|And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.
Mark|2|6|But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark|2|7|God?
Mark|2|8|And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
Mark|2|9|Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
Mark|2|10|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),
Mark|2|11|I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.
Mark|2|12|And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
Mark|2|13|And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
Mark|2|14|of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
Mark|2|15|And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark|2|16|that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
Mark|2|17|And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Mark|2|18|And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark|2|19|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark|2|20|But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.
Mark|2|21|No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made.
Mark|2|22|new wine into fresh wine-skins.
Mark|2|23|And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.
Mark|2|24|And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
Mark|2|25|And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?
Mark|2|26|How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?
Mark|2|27|And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Mark|2|28|
Mark|3|1|And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
Mark|3|2|And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
Mark|3|3|And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.
Mark|3|4|And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
Mark|3|5|And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
Mark|3|6|And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
Mark|3|7|And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,
Mark|3|8|and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.
Mark|3|9|And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:
Mark|3|10|for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
Mark|3|11|And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
Mark|3|12|And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
Mark|3|13|And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.
Mark|3|14|And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark|3|15|and to have authority to cast out demons:
Mark|3|16|and Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark|3|17|of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
Mark|3|18|of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
Mark|3|19|and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house.
Mark|3|20|And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
Mark|3|21|And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
Mark|3|22|And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons.
Mark|3|23|And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark|3|24|And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark|3|25|And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
Mark|3|26|And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
Mark|3|27|; and then he will spoil his house.
Mark|3|28|Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
Mark|3|29|but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:
Mark|3|30|because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark|3|31|And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.
Mark|3|32|And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
Mark|3|33|And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?
Mark|3|34|And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Mark|3|35|
Mark|4|1|And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.
Mark|4|2|And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,
Mark|4|3|Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:
Mark|4|4|fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.
Mark|4|5|, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:
Mark|4|6|and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark|4|7|And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark|4|8|And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|9|And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|10|And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.
Mark|4|11|And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:
Mark|4|12|that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.
Mark|4|13|And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?
Mark|4|14|The sower soweth the word.
Mark|4|15|And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.
Mark|4|16|, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;
Mark|4|17|and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.
Mark|4|18|And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,
Mark|4|19|and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
Mark|4|20|And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|21|not to be put on the stand?
Mark|4|22|made secret, but that it should come to light.
Mark|4|23|If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|24|And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.
Mark|4|25|For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Mark|4|26|And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
Mark|4|27|and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.
Mark|4|28|The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
Mark|4|29|But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.
Mark|4|30|And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?
Mark|4|31|It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,
Mark|4|32|yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.
Mark|4|33|And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;
Mark|4|34|and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.
Mark|4|35|And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.
Mark|4|36|And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.
Mark|4|37|And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.
Mark|4|38|And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
Mark|4|39|And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
Mark|4|40|And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?
Mark|4|41|
Mark|5|1|And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes.
Mark|5|2|And when he was come out of the boat, straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
Mark|5|3|who had his dwelling in the tombs: and no man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain;
Mark|5|4|because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been rent asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and no man had strength to tame him.
Mark|5|5|And always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.
Mark|5|6|And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him;
Mark|5|7|and crying out with a loud voice, he saith, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.
Mark|5|8|For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man.
Mark|5|9|And he asked him, What is thy name? And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many.
Mark|5|10|And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark|5|11|Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding.
Mark|5|12|And they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
Mark|5|13|about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.
Mark|5|14|And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.
Mark|5|15|him that had the legion: and they were afraid.
Mark|5|16|And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.
Mark|5|17|And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.
Mark|5|18|And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him.
Mark|5|19|he had mercy on thee.
Mark|5|20|And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men marvelled.
Mark|5|21|And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea.
Mark|5|22|And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falleth at his feet,
Mark|5|23|, that thou come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.
Mark|5|24|And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.
Mark|5|25|And a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,
Mark|5|26|and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
Mark|5|27|having heard the things concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.
Mark|5|28|For she said, If I touch but his garments, I shall be made whole.
Mark|5|29|And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.
Mark|5|30|from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?
Mark|5|31|And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
Mark|5|32|And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
Mark|5|33|But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.
Mark|5|34|And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
Mark|5|35|saying, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Teacher any further?
Mark|5|36|But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
Mark|5|37|And he suffered no man to follow with him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
Mark|5|38|weeping and wailing greatly.
Mark|5|39|And when he was entered in, he saith unto them, Why make ye a tumult, and weep? the child is not dead, but sleepeth.
Mark|5|40|And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him, and goeth in where the child was.
Mark|5|41|And taking the child by the hand, he saith unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.
Mark|5|42|And straightway the damsel rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement.
Mark|5|43|
Mark|6|1|And he went out from thence; and he cometh into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
Mark|6|2|such mighty works wrought by his hands?
Mark|6|3|Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.
Mark|6|4|And Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.
Mark|6|5|And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.
Mark|6|6|And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages teaching.
Mark|6|7|And he calleth unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
Mark|6|8|journey, save a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse;
Mark|6|9|, put not on two coats.
Mark|6|10|And he said unto them, Wheresoever ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart thence.
Mark|6|11|And whatsoever place shall not receive you, and they hear you not, as ye go forth thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them.
Mark|6|12|should repent.
Mark|6|13|And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
Mark|6|14|; for his name had become known: and he said, John the Baptizer is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.
Mark|6|15|as one of the prophets.
Mark|6|16|, said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.
Mark|6|17|For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.
Mark|6|18|For John said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
Mark|6|19|And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;
Mark|6|20|for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.
Mark|6|21|And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;
Mark|6|22|and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him; and the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.
Mark|6|23|And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
Mark|6|24|And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptizer.
Mark|6|25|And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Mark|6|26|And the king was exceeding sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat, he would not reject her.
Mark|6|27|And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark|6|28|and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the damsel; and the damsel gave it to her mother.
Mark|6|29|, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
Mark|6|30|And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus; and they told him all things, whatsoever they had done, and whatsoever they had taught.
Mark|6|31|And he saith unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
Mark|6|32|And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.
Mark|6|33|, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.
Mark|6|34|And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
Mark|6|35|And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;
Mark|6|36|send them away, that they may go into the country and villages round about, and buy themselves somewhat to eat.
Mark|6|37|But he answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings’ worth of bread, and give them to eat?
Mark|6|38|see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
Mark|6|39|And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass.
Mark|6|40|And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
Mark|6|41|And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.
Mark|6|42|And they all ate, and were filled.
Mark|6|43|And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes.
Mark|6|44|And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark|6|45|unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sendeth the multitude away.
Mark|6|46|And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
Mark|6|47|And when even was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
Mark|6|48|And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them, about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:
Mark|6|49|but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
Mark|6|50|for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he straightway spake with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.
Mark|6|51|And he went up unto them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves;
Mark|6|52|for they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.
Mark|6|53|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land unto Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.
Mark|6|54|knew him,
Mark|6|55|and ran round about that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
Mark|6|56|
Mark|7|1|And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
Mark|7|2|and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.
Mark|7|3|(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;
Mark|7|4|from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)
Mark|7|5|And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?
Mark|7|6|
Mark|7|7|
Mark|7|8|Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.
Mark|7|9|And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.
Mark|7|10|For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:
Mark|7|11|;
Mark|7|12|ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;
Mark|7|13|making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
Mark|7|14|And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:
Mark|7|15|there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
Mark|7|16|
Mark|7|17|And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
Mark|7|18|cannot defile him;
Mark|7|19|, making all meats clean.
Mark|7|20|And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.
Mark|7|21|For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,
Mark|7|22|covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:
Mark|7|23|all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
Mark|7|24|And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.
Mark|7|25|But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
Mark|7|26|Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
Mark|7|27|And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Mark|7|28|But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
Mark|7|29|And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
Mark|7|30|And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
Mark|7|31|And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
Mark|7|32|And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.
Mark|7|33|And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;
Mark|7|34|and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
Mark|7|35|And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
Mark|7|36|And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.
Mark|7|37|
Mark|8|1|In those days, when there was again a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Mark|8|2|I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:
Mark|8|3|and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them are come from far.
Mark|8|4|And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?
Mark|8|5|And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
Mark|8|6|And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
Mark|8|7|And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.
Mark|8|8|And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.
Mark|8|9|And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
Mark|8|10|And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark|8|11|And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.
Mark|8|12|And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
Mark|8|13|departed to the other side.
Mark|8|14|And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.
Mark|8|15|And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
Mark|8|16|And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.
Mark|8|17|And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?
Mark|8|18|Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
Mark|8|19|When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
Mark|8|20|And when the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up? And they say unto him, Seven.
Mark|8|21|And he said unto them, Do ye not yet understand?
Mark|8|22|And they come unto Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him to touch him.
Mark|8|23|And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught?
Mark|8|24|as trees, walking.
Mark|8|25|Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked stedfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.
Mark|8|26|And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
Mark|8|27|And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?
Mark|8|28|And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.
Mark|8|29|And he asked them, But who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
Mark|8|30|And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
Mark|8|31|And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
Mark|8|32|And he spake the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
Mark|8|33|But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and saith, Get thee behind me, Satan; for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Mark|8|34|And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples, and said unto them, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Mark|8|35|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.
Mark|8|36|For what doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?
Mark|8|37|For what should a man give in exchange for his life?
Mark|8|38|
Mark|9|1|, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.
Mark|9|2|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them;
Mark|9|3|and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
Mark|9|4|And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
Mark|9|5|And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Mark|9|6|For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.
Mark|9|7|And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear ye him.
Mark|9|8|And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
Mark|9|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead.
Mark|9|10|And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.
Mark|9|11|that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
Mark|9|12|And he said unto them, Elijah indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought?
Mark|9|13|But I say unto you, that Elijah is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him.
Mark|9|14|And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
Mark|9|15|And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
Mark|9|16|And he asked them, What question ye with them?
Mark|9|17|And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;
Mark|9|18|and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.
Mark|9|19|And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me.
Mark|9|20|And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
Mark|9|21|And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child.
Mark|9|22|And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.
Mark|9|23|And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.
Mark|9|24|Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
Mark|9|25|And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
Mark|9|26|became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.
Mark|9|27|But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
Mark|9|28|that we could not cast it out?
Mark|9|29|And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.
Mark|9|30|And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
Mark|9|31|For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|9|32|But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
Mark|9|33|And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way?
Mark|9|34|the greatest.
Mark|9|35|And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
Mark|9|36|And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,
Mark|9|37|Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
Mark|9|38|John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.
Mark|9|39|But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
Mark|9|40|For he that is not against us is for us.
Mark|9|41|For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Mark|9|42|And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
Mark|9|43|And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
Mark|9|44|
Mark|9|45|And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell.
Mark|9|46|
Mark|9|47|And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;
Mark|9|48|where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
Mark|9|49|For every one shall be salted with fire.
Mark|9|50|
Mark|10|1|And he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of Judaea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
Mark|10|2|wife? trying him.
Mark|10|3|And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
Mark|10|4|And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.
Mark|10|5|But Jesus said unto them, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.
Mark|10|6|But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female made he them.
Mark|10|7|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
Mark|10|8|and the two shall become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
Mark|10|9|What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Mark|10|10|And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.
Mark|10|11|And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her:
Mark|10|12|and if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery.
Mark|10|13|And they were bringing unto him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.
Mark|10|14|But when Jesus saw it, he was moved with indignation, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|15|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
Mark|10|16|And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them.
Mark|10|17|And as he was going forth into the way, there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark|10|18|God.
Mark|10|19|Thou knowest the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor thy father and mother.
Mark|10|20|And he said unto him, Teacher, all these things have I observed from my youth.
Mark|10|21|And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Mark|10|22|But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one that had great possessions.
Mark|10|23|And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|24|And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|25|It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|26|And they were astonished exceedingly, saying unto him, Then who can be saved?
Mark|10|27|Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
Mark|10|28|Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
Mark|10|29|Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel’s sake,
Mark|10|30|but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
Mark|10|31|first shall be last; and the last first.
Mark|10|32|And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and they that followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him,
Mark|10|33|, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles:
Mark|10|34|and they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him, and shall kill him; and after three days he shall rise again.
Mark|10|35|And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Teacher, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee.
Mark|10|36|And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
Mark|10|37|left hand, in thy glory.
Mark|10|38|But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
Mark|10|39|And they said unto him, We are able. And Jesus said unto them, The cup that I drink ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
Mark|10|40|for whom it hath been prepared.
Mark|10|41|And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.
Mark|10|42|And Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Mark|10|43|But it is not so among you: but whosoever would become great among you, shall be your minister;
Mark|10|44|and whosoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.
Mark|10|45|For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Mark|10|46|And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the way side.
Mark|10|47|And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|48|And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
Mark|10|49|And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.
Mark|10|50|And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
Mark|10|51|And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.
Mark|10|52|
Mark|11|1|And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,
Mark|11|2|and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.
Mark|11|3|And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.
Mark|11|4|And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.
Mark|11|5|And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
Mark|11|6|And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.
Mark|11|7|And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.
Mark|11|8|And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.
Mark|11|9|he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Mark|11|10|of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.
Mark|11|11|And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
Mark|11|12|And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.
Mark|11|13|And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.
Mark|11|14|And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.
Mark|11|15|And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Mark|11|16|and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.
Mark|11|17|And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.
Mark|11|18|And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
Mark|11|19|And every evening he went forth out of the city.
Mark|11|20|And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.
Mark|11|21|And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
Mark|11|22|And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
Mark|11|23|Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.
Mark|11|24|Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
Mark|11|25|And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
Mark|11|26|
Mark|11|27|And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;
Mark|11|28|and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?
Mark|11|29|And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|11|30|The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.
Mark|11|31|And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
Mark|11|32|But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.
Mark|11|33|
Mark|12|1|And he began to speak unto them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a pit for the winepress, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Mark|12|2|And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard.
Mark|12|3|And they took him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
Mark|12|4|And again he sent unto them another servant; and him they wounded in the head, and handled shamefully.
Mark|12|5|And he sent another; and him they killed: and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Mark|12|6|He had yet one, a beloved son: he sent him last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
Mark|12|7|But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
Mark|12|8|And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.
Mark|12|9|What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
Mark|12|10|
Mark|12|11|
Mark|12|12|And they sought to lay hold on him; and they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them: and they left him, and went away.
Mark|12|13|And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in talk.
Mark|12|14|And when they were come, they say unto him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not the person of men, but of a truth teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Mark|12|15|Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why make ye trial of me? bring me a denarius, that I may see it.
Mark|12|16|And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
Mark|12|17|And Jesus said unto them, Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled greatly at him.
Mark|12|18|And there come unto him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Mark|12|19|Teacher, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave a wife behind him, and leave no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Mark|12|20|There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed;
Mark|12|21|and the second took her, and died, leaving no seed behind him; and the third likewise:
Mark|12|22|and the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
Mark|12|23|In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
Mark|12|24|Jesus said unto them, Is it not for this cause that ye err, that ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
Mark|12|25|For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as angels in heaven.
Mark|12|26|the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
Mark|12|27|He is not the God of the dead, but of the living: ye do greatly err.
Mark|12|28|And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?
Mark|12|29|Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:
Mark|12|30|and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.
Mark|12|31|The second is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
Mark|12|32|And the scribe said unto him, Of a truth, Teacher, thou hast well said that he is one; and there is none other but he:
Mark|12|33|and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
Mark|12|34|And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.
Mark|12|35|And Jesus answered and said, as he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark|12|36|
Mark|12|37|David himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark|12|38|salutations in the marketplaces,
Mark|12|39|and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:
Mark|12|40|they that devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation.
Mark|12|41|And he sat down over against the treasury, and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
Mark|12|42|And there came a poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make a farthing.
Mark|12|43|And he called unto him his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury:
Mark|12|44|
Mark|13|1|And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Teacher, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of buildings!
Mark|13|2|And Jesus said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down.
Mark|13|3|And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Mark|13|4|the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?
Mark|13|5|And Jesus began to say unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
Mark|13|6|; and shall lead many astray.
Mark|13|7|must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
Mark|13|8|For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in divers places; there shall be famines: these things are the beginning of travail.
Mark|13|9|But take ye heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|13|10|And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations.
Mark|13|11|, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
Mark|13|12|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Mark|13|13|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Mark|13|14|But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not (let him that readeth understand), then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains:
Mark|13|15|and let him that is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out his house:
Mark|13|16|and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
Mark|13|17|But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
Mark|13|18|And pray ye that it be not in the winter.
Mark|13|19|For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never shall be.
Mark|13|20|And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect’s sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days.
Mark|13|21|not:
Mark|13|22|for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.
Mark|13|23|But take ye heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.
Mark|13|24|But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
Mark|13|25|and the stars shall be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.
Mark|13|26|And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
Mark|13|27|And then shall he send forth the angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Mark|13|28|Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;
Mark|13|29|at the doors.
Mark|13|30|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished.
Mark|13|31|Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark|13|32|But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Mark|13|33|Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
Mark|13|34|a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch.
Mark|13|35|Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning;
Mark|13|36|lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
Mark|13|37|
Mark|14|1|the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him:
Mark|14|2|for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people.
Mark|14|3|she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.
Mark|14|4|, To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made?
Mark|14|5|For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
Mark|14|6|But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
Mark|14|7|For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always.
Mark|14|8|She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
Mark|14|9|And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
Mark|14|10|And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them.
Mark|14|11|.
Mark|14|12|And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover?
Mark|14|13|And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him;
Mark|14|14|and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
Mark|14|15|ready: and there make ready for us.
Mark|14|16|And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
Mark|14|17|And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve.
Mark|14|18|he that eateth with me.
Mark|14|19|They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I?
Mark|14|20|one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish.
Mark|14|21|For the Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
Mark|14|22|And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body.
Mark|14|23|And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.
Mark|14|24|And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
Mark|14|25|Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Mark|14|26|And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.
Mark|14|27|And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.
Mark|14|28|Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark|14|29|But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
Mark|14|30|this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.
Mark|14|31|But he spake exceedingly vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.
Mark|14|32|And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.
Mark|14|33|And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled.
Mark|14|34|And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch.
Mark|14|35|And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
Mark|14|36|And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt.
Mark|14|37|And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour?
Mark|14|38|Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Mark|14|39|And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
Mark|14|40|And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
Mark|14|41|And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Mark|14|42|Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
Mark|14|43|And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark|14|44|Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
Mark|14|45|And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.
Mark|14|46|And they laid hands on him, and took him.
Mark|14|47|But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
Mark|14|48|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?
Mark|14|49|that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
Mark|14|50|And they all left him, and fled.
Mark|14|51|: and they lay hold on him;
Mark|14|52|but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
Mark|14|53|And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
Mark|14|54|.
Mark|14|55|Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.
Mark|14|56|For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.
Mark|14|57|And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
Mark|14|58|We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark|14|59|And not even so did their witness agree together.
Mark|14|60|And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Mark|14|61|But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark|14|62|And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
Mark|14|63|And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses?
Mark|14|64|Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
Mark|14|65|And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.
Mark|14|66|And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest;
Mark|14|67|Jesus.
Mark|14|68|But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
Mark|14|69|of them.
Mark|14|70|of them; for thou art a Galilaean.
Mark|14|71|But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
Mark|14|72|
Mark|15|1|And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
Mark|15|2|And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.
Mark|15|3|And the chief priests accused him of many things.
Mark|15|4|And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.
Mark|15|5|But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.
Mark|15|6|Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
Mark|15|7|bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
Mark|15|8|as he was wont to do unto them.
Mark|15|9|And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|10|For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
Mark|15|11|But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
Mark|15|12|And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|13|And they cried out again, Crucify him.
Mark|15|14|And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.
Mark|15|15|And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
Mark|15|16|And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
Mark|15|17|And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;
Mark|15|18|and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
Mark|15|19|And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
Mark|15|20|And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.
Mark|15|21|, that he might bear his cross.
Mark|15|22|And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
Mark|15|23|And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
Mark|15|24|And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.
Mark|15|25|And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
Mark|15|26|And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark|15|27|And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
Mark|15|28|
Mark|15|29|And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
Mark|15|30|save thyself, and come down from the cross.
Mark|15|31|among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Mark|15|32|Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.
Mark|15|33|And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark|15|34|And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Mark|15|35|And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.
Mark|15|36|And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.
Mark|15|37|And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
Mark|15|38|And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
Mark|15|39|And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark|15|40|both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
Mark|15|41|who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Mark|15|42|And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
Mark|15|43|there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark|15|44|And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
Mark|15|45|And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mark|15|46|And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mark|15|47|
Mark|16|1|of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
Mark|16|2|And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.
Mark|16|3|And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?
Mark|16|4|and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.
Mark|16|5|And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.
Mark|16|6|And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!
Mark|16|7|But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
Mark|16|8|And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.
Mark|16|9|Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
Mark|16|10|She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
Mark|16|11|And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.
Mark|16|12|And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.
Mark|16|13|And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.
Mark|16|14|And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.
Mark|16|15|And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.
Mark|16|16|He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.
Mark|16|17|And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
Mark|16|18|they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Mark|16|19|So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
Mark|16|20|
Daniel|1|1|In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
Daniel|1|2|And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god: and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
Daniel|1|3|of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles;
Daniel|1|4|youths in whom was no blemish, but well-favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and endued with knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
Daniel|1|5|And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s dainties, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they should stand before the king.
Daniel|1|6|Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
Daniel|1|7|Abed-nego.
Daniel|1|8|But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s dainties, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
Daniel|1|9|Now God made Daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
Daniel|1|10|And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.
Daniel|1|11|Then said Daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
Daniel|1|12|Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
Daniel|1|13|Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s dainties; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.
Daniel|1|14|So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
Daniel|1|15|And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s dainties.
Daniel|1|16|So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
Daniel|1|17|Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
Daniel|1|18|And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel|1|19|And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
Daniel|1|20|And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.
Daniel|1|21|
Daniel|2|1|And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him.
Daniel|2|2|Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
Daniel|2|3|And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
Daniel|2|4|Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in the Syrian language, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
Daniel|2|5|The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
Daniel|2|6|But if ye show the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream and the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|2|7|They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
Daniel|2|8|The king answered and said, I know of a certainty that ye would gain time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
Daniel|2|9|But if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|2|10|The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter, forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.
Daniel|2|11|And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
Daniel|2|12|For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|13|So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
Daniel|2|14|Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
Daniel|2|15|he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Wherefore is the decree so urgent from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
Daniel|2|16|And Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|17|Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
Daniel|2|18|that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|19|Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel|2|20|Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.
Daniel|2|21|And he changeth the times and the seasons; he removeth kings, and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding;
Daniel|2|22|he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
Daniel|2|23|I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of thee; for thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.
Daniel|2|24|Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|25|Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
Daniel|2|26|The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
Daniel|2|27|Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, show unto the king;
Daniel|2|28|but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and he hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:
Daniel|2|29|upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.
Daniel|2|30|But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
Daniel|2|31|Thou, O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof was terrible.
Daniel|2|32|As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,
Daniel|2|33|its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.
Daniel|2|34|Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.
Daniel|2|35|Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
Daniel|2|36|This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Daniel|2|37|Thou, O king, art king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;
Daniel|2|38|and wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule over them all: thou art the head of gold.
Daniel|2|39|And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
Daniel|2|40|And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.
Daniel|2|41|And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
Daniel|2|42|And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
Daniel|2|43|And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.
Daniel|2|44|And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
Daniel|2|45|Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
Daniel|2|46|Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him.
Daniel|2|47|The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.
Daniel|2|48|Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
Daniel|2|49|
Daniel|3|1|Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
Daniel|3|2|Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel|3|3|Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Daniel|3|4|Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
Daniel|3|5|that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;
Daniel|3|6|and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|7|Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Daniel|3|8|Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.
Daniel|3|9|They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel|3|10|Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;
Daniel|3|11|and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|12|There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Daniel|3|13|rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
Daniel|3|14|Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
Daniel|3|15|: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?
Daniel|3|16|Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
Daniel|3|17|, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.
Daniel|3|18|But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Daniel|3|19|he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
Daniel|3|20|to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|21|garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|22|Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
Daniel|3|23|And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Daniel|3|24|Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spake and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
Daniel|3|25|He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.
Daniel|3|26|Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.
Daniel|3|27|And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
Daniel|3|28|Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
Daniel|3|29|Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.
Daniel|3|30|
Daniel|4|1|Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
Daniel|4|2|It hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me.
Daniel|4|3|How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
Daniel|4|4|I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
Daniel|4|5|I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
Daniel|4|6|Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
Daniel|4|7|Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|4|8|,
Daniel|4|9|O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
Daniel|4|10|Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and, behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and the height thereof was great.
Daniel|4|11|The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.
Daniel|4|12|The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed from it.
Daniel|4|13|I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.
Daniel|4|14|He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
Daniel|4|15|Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
Daniel|4|16|let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
Daniel|4|17|The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the lowest of men.
Daniel|4|18|This dream I, king Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
Daniel|4|19|Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken dumb for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.
Daniel|4|20|The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
Daniel|4|21|whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation:
Daniel|4|22|it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
Daniel|4|23|And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
Daniel|4|24|this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
Daniel|4|25|that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
Daniel|4|26|And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
Daniel|4|27|Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
Daniel|4|28|All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
Daniel|4|29|At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.
Daniel|4|30|The king spake and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?
Daniel|4|31|, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from thee:
Daniel|4|32|and thou shalt be driven from men; and they dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
Daniel|4|33|.
Daniel|4|34|And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him that liveth for ever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.
Daniel|4|35|And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
Daniel|4|36|At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added unto me.
Daniel|4|37|
Daniel|5|1|Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
Daniel|5|2|Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink therefrom.
Daniel|5|3|Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.
Daniel|5|4|They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
Daniel|5|5|In the same hour came forth the fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Daniel|5|6|Then the king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
Daniel|5|7|The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spake and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|8|Then came in all the king’s wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.
Daniel|5|9|Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
Daniel|5|10|the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: the queen spake and said, O king, live forever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.
Daniel|5|11|, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
Daniel|5|12|forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.
Daniel|5|13|Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?
Daniel|5|14|I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee.
Daniel|5|15|And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.
Daniel|5|16|But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and dissolve doubts; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|17|Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
Daniel|5|18|O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty:
Daniel|5|19|and because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down.
Daniel|5|20|But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
Daniel|5|21|and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts’, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that he setteth up over it whomsoever he will.
Daniel|5|22|And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this,
Daniel|5|23|but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine from them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.
Daniel|5|24|Then was the part of the hand sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.
Daniel|5|25|And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
Daniel|5|26|This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end;
Daniel|5|27|TEKEL; thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
Daniel|5|28|PERES; thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
Daniel|5|29|Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Daniel|5|30|In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.
Daniel|5|31|
Daniel|6|1|It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;
Daniel|6|2|and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage.
Daniel|6|3|Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
Daniel|6|4|Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
Daniel|6|5|Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
Daniel|6|6|Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
Daniel|6|7|All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counsellors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
Daniel|6|8|Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|9|Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
Daniel|6|10|And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
Daniel|6|11|Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Daniel|6|12|Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s interdict: Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save unto thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Daniel|6|13|Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
Daniel|6|14|Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to rescue him.
Daniel|6|15|Then these men assembled together unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
Daniel|6|16|the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
Daniel|6|17|And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
Daniel|6|18|Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep fled from him.
Daniel|6|19|Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
Daniel|6|20|And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a lamentable voice; the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
Daniel|6|21|Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
Daniel|6|22|My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Daniel|6|23|Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God.
Daniel|6|24|And the king commanded, and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.
Daniel|6|25|Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
Daniel|6|26|I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
Daniel|6|27|He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
Daniel|6|28|
Daniel|7|1|In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
Daniel|7|2|Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.
Daniel|7|3|And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
Daniel|7|4|The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.
Daniel|7|5|And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
Daniel|7|6|After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
Daniel|7|7|After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
Daniel|7|8|I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
Daniel|7|9|the wheels thereof burning fire.
Daniel|7|10|A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
Daniel|7|11|I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
Daniel|7|12|And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
Daniel|7|13|I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
Daniel|7|14|And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
Daniel|7|15|As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
Daniel|7|16|I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
Daniel|7|17|These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.
Daniel|7|18|But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
Daniel|7|19|Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
Daniel|7|20|which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.
Daniel|7|21|I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
Daniel|7|22|until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
Daniel|7|23|Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
Daniel|7|24|And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
Daniel|7|25|And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
Daniel|7|26|But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
Daniel|7|27|And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
Daniel|7|28|
Daniel|8|1|In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me, Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
Daniel|8|2|And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
Daniel|8|3|Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
Daniel|8|4|I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
Daniel|8|5|And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
Daniel|8|6|And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.
Daniel|8|7|And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
Daniel|8|8|toward the four winds of heaven.
Daniel|8|9|.
Daniel|8|10|And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
Daniel|8|11|, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
Daniel|8|12|and prospered.
Daniel|8|13|, and the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
Daniel|8|14|mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
Daniel|8|15|And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
Daniel|8|16|the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
Daniel|8|17|So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.
Daniel|8|18|Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
Daniel|8|19|And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.
Daniel|8|20|The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
Daniel|8|21|And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
Daniel|8|22|And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
Daniel|8|23|And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
Daniel|8|24|; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.
Daniel|8|25|security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
Daniel|8|26|.
Daniel|8|27|
Daniel|9|1|In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,
Daniel|9|2|in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.
Daniel|9|3|And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
Daniel|9|4|And I prayed unto Jehovah my God, and made confession, and said, Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments,
Daniel|9|5|we have sinned, and have dealt perversely, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances;
Daniel|9|6|neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, that spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
Daniel|9|7|O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
Daniel|9|8|O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
Daniel|9|9|To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness; for we have rebelled against him;
Daniel|9|10|neither have we obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
Daniel|9|11|Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even turning aside, that they should not obey thy voice: therefore hath the curse been poured out upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.
Daniel|9|12|And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
Daniel|9|13|As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet have we not entreated the favor of Jehovah our God, that we should turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in thy truth.
Daniel|9|14|Therefore hath Jehovah watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth, and we have not obeyed his voice.
Daniel|9|15|And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
Daniel|9|16|O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy wrath, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us.
Daniel|9|17|Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
Daniel|9|18|O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies’ sake.
Daniel|9|19|O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
Daniel|9|20|And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Daniel|9|21|yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
Daniel|9|22|And he instructed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding.
Daniel|9|23|At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.
Daniel|9|24|Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy.
Daniel|9|25|Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: it shall be built again, with street and moat, even in troublous times.
Daniel|9|26|And after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off, and shall have nothing: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and even unto the end shall be war; desolations are determined.
Daniel|9|27|
Daniel|10|1|In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.
Daniel|10|2|In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three whole weeks.
Daniel|10|3|I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
Daniel|10|4|And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel,
Daniel|10|5|I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz:
Daniel|10|6|his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
Daniel|10|7|And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
Daniel|10|8|So I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
Daniel|10|9|Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.
Daniel|10|10|And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
Daniel|10|11|And he said unto me, O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
Daniel|10|12|Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words’ sake.
Daniel|10|13|But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
Daniel|10|14|days:
Daniel|10|15|and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.
Daniel|10|16|And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.
Daniel|10|17|For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.
Daniel|10|18|Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.
Daniel|10|19|And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
Daniel|10|20|Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.
Daniel|10|21|
Daniel|11|1|And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him.
Daniel|11|2|And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.
Daniel|11|3|And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
Daniel|11|4|And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.
Daniel|11|5|of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
Daniel|11|6|And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in those times.
Daniel|11|7|But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come unto the army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail.
Daniel|11|8|with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north.
Daniel|11|9|And he shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.
Daniel|11|10|And his sons shall war, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall come on, and overflow, and pass through; and they shall return and war, even to his fortress.
Daniel|11|11|And the king of the south shall be moved with anger, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand.
Daniel|11|12|And the multitude shall be lifted up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of thousands, but he shall not prevail.
Daniel|11|13|years, with a great army and with much substance.
Daniel|11|14|And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
Daniel|11|15|So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to stand.
Daniel|11|16|But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the glorious land, and in his hand shall be destruction.
Daniel|11|17|And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and with him equitable conditions; and he shall perform them: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to corrupt her; but she shall not stand, neither be for him.
Daniel|11|18|After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, moreover, he shall cause his reproach to turn upon him.
Daniel|11|19|Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
Daniel|11|20|Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
Daniel|11|21|And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
Daniel|11|22|And the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
Daniel|11|23|And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; for he shall come up, and shall become strong, with a small people.
Daniel|11|24|In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance: yea, he shall devise his devices against the strongholds, even for a time.
Daniel|11|25|And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army; but he shall not stand; for they shall devise devices against him.
Daniel|11|26|Yea, they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many shall fall down slain.
Daniel|11|27|And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table: but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.
Daniel|11|28|, and return to his own land.
Daniel|11|29|At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former.
Daniel|11|30|: he shall even return, and have regard unto them that forsake the holy covenant.
Daniel|11|31|, and they shall set up the abomination that maketh desolate.
Daniel|11|32|.
Daniel|11|33|days.
Daniel|11|34|Now when they shall fall, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries.
Daniel|11|35|And some of them that are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time appointed.
Daniel|11|36|And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done.
Daniel|11|37|Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall magnify himself above all.
Daniel|11|38|But in his place shall he honor the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.
Daniel|11|39|he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.
Daniel|11|40|And at the time of the end shall the king of the south contend with him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through.
Daniel|11|41|shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
Daniel|11|42|He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
Daniel|11|43|But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
Daniel|11|44|But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many.
Daniel|11|45|
Daniel|12|1|And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
Daniel|12|2|And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
Daniel|12|3|And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
Daniel|12|4|But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
Daniel|12|5|Then I, Daniel, looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the brink of the river on this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side.
Daniel|12|6|And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?
Daniel|12|7|And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
Daniel|12|8|And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my lord, what shall be the issue of these things?
Daniel|12|9|And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end.
Daniel|12|10|Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand.
Daniel|12|11|shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days.
Daniel|12|12|Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.
Daniel|12|13|
Esther|1|1|Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces),
Esther|1|2|that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
Esther|1|3|in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him;
Esther|1|4|when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.
Esther|1|5|And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
Esther|1|6|blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.
Esther|1|7|And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king.
Esther|1|8|And the drinking was according to the law; none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.
Esther|1|9|Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
Esther|1|10|On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
Esther|1|11|to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on.
Esther|1|12|But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
Esther|1|13|Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment;
Esther|1|14|and the next unto him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat first in the kingdom),
Esther|1|15|What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
Esther|1|16|And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|1|17|For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
Esther|1|18|much contempt and wrath.
Esther|1|19|If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
Esther|1|20|And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
Esther|1|21|And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
Esther|1|22|
Esther|2|1|After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
Esther|2|2|Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
Esther|2|3|and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them;
Esther|2|4|and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
Esther|2|5|There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,
Esther|2|6|who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
Esther|2|7|And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
Esther|2|8|So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
Esther|2|9|And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house: and he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.
Esther|2|10|Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.
Esther|2|11|And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
Esther|2|12|, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),
Esther|2|13|then in this wise came the maiden unto the king: whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
Esther|2|14|In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.
Esther|2|15|Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
Esther|2|16|So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
Esther|2|17|And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Esther|2|18|Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.
Esther|2|19|And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.
Esther|2|20|Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
Esther|2|21|In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the threshold, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|2|22|in Mordecai’s name.
Esther|2|23|
Esther|3|1|After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
Esther|3|2|And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence.
Esther|3|3|Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
Esther|3|4|Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther|3|5|And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
Esther|3|6|But he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
Esther|3|7|, which is the month Adar.
Esther|3|8|every people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.
Esther|3|9|business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
Esther|3|10|And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
Esther|3|11|And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
Esther|3|12|Then were the king’s scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof; and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people, to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king’s ring.
Esther|3|13|of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
Esther|3|14|A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
Esther|3|15|
Esther|4|1|Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
Esther|4|2|and he came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
Esther|4|3|And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
Esther|4|4|And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly grieved: and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him; but he received it not.
Esther|4|5|Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.
Esther|4|6|So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate.
Esther|4|7|And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
Esther|4|8|Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.
Esther|4|9|And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Esther|4|10|:
Esther|4|11|All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
Esther|4|12|And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Esther|4|13|Then Mordecai bade them return answer unto Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
Esther|4|14|For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish: and who knoweth whether thou art not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
Esther|4|15|Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai,
Esther|4|16|Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
Esther|4|17|
Esther|5|1|Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.
Esther|5|2|And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
Esther|5|3|Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.
Esther|5|4|And Esther said, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
Esther|5|5|Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
Esther|5|6|And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther|5|7|Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:
Esther|5|8|if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.
Esther|5|9|Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up nor moved for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
Esther|5|10|Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.
Esther|5|11|And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
Esther|5|12|Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king.
Esther|5|13|Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.
Esther|5|14|
Esther|6|1|On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
Esther|6|2|And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.
Esther|6|3|And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.
Esther|6|4|And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
Esther|6|5|And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
Esther|6|6|So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
Esther|6|7|And Haman said unto the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
Esther|6|8|let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on the head of which a crown royal is set:
Esther|6|9|and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
Esther|6|10|Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
Esther|6|11|Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
Esther|6|12|And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
Esther|6|13|And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
Esther|6|14|
Esther|7|1|So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
Esther|7|2|And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
Esther|7|3|Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
Esther|7|4|for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king’s damage.
Esther|7|5|Then spake the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
Esther|7|6|And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
Esther|7|7|into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
Esther|7|8|Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
Esther|7|9|Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spake good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him thereon.
Esther|7|10|
Esther|8|1|On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.
Esther|8|2|And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
Esther|8|3|And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
Esther|8|4|Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.
Esther|8|5|And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces:
Esther|8|6|for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Esther|8|7|Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
Esther|8|8|Write ye also to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.
Esther|8|9|thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
Esther|8|10|And he wrote the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by post on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud:
Esther|8|11|little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
Esther|8|12|of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
Esther|8|13|A copy of the writing, that the decree should be given out in every province, was published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
Esther|8|14|So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace.
Esther|8|15|And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.
Esther|8|16|The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor.
Esther|8|17|
Esther|9|1|Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them, (whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them,)
Esther|9|2|the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.
Esther|9|3|And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.
Esther|9|4|For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
Esther|9|5|And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them.
Esther|9|6|And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Esther|9|7|And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
Esther|9|8|and Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
Esther|9|9|and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,
Esther|9|10|the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew’s enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|11|On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
Esther|9|12|And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
Esther|9|13|Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
Esther|9|14|And the king commanded it so to be done: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
Esther|9|15|And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|16|And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
Esther|9|17|on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther|9|18|of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Esther|9|19|gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
Esther|9|20|And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
Esther|9|21|to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
Esther|9|22|as the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
Esther|9|23|And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;
Esther|9|24|because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
Esther|9|25|came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Esther|9|26|Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them,
Esther|9|27|the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year;
Esther|9|28|and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.
Esther|9|29|Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.
Esther|9|30|words of peace and truth,
Esther|9|31|to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.
Esther|9|32|
Esther|10|1|And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
Esther|10|2|And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
Esther|10|3|
Nehemiah|1|1|The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
Nehemiah|1|2|that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|1|3|And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
Nehemiah|1|4|And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
Nehemiah|1|5|and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:
Nehemiah|1|6|Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father’s house have sinned:
Nehemiah|1|7|we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
Nehemiah|1|8|Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:
Nehemiah|1|9|but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.
Nehemiah|1|10|Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
Nehemiah|1|11|
Nehemiah|2|1|sad in his presence.
Nehemiah|2|2|And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.
Nehemiah|2|3|And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
Nehemiah|2|4|Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
Nehemiah|2|5|And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.
Nehemiah|2|6|And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
Nehemiah|2|7|Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;
Nehemiah|2|8|and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
Nehemiah|2|9|Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.
Nehemiah|2|10|And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
Nehemiah|2|11|So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
Nehemiah|2|12|And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
Nehemiah|2|13|And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
Nehemiah|2|14|Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
Nehemiah|2|15|Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.
Nehemiah|2|16|And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
Nehemiah|2|17|Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
Nehemiah|2|18|.
Nehemiah|2|19|But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
Nehemiah|2|20|
Nehemiah|3|1|Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.
Nehemiah|3|2|And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

Nehemiah|3|14|And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.
Nehemiah|3|15|And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.
Nehemiah|3|16|After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men.

Nehemiah|3|32|
Nehemiah|4|1|But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
Nehemiah|4|2|And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?
Nehemiah|4|3|Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.
Nehemiah|4|4|Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;
Nehemiah|4|5|to anger before the builders.
Nehemiah|4|6|thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
Nehemiah|4|7|that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;
Nehemiah|4|8|and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.
Nehemiah|4|9|But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
Nehemiah|4|10|And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
Nehemiah|4|11|And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
Nehemiah|4|12|And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.
Nehemiah|4|13|the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
Nehemiah|4|14|And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
Nehemiah|4|15|And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
Nehemiah|4|16|And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
Nehemiah|4|17|They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;
Nehemiah|4|18|and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
Nehemiah|4|19|And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:
Nehemiah|4|20|in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.
Nehemiah|4|21|So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
Nehemiah|4|22|Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.
Nehemiah|4|23|
Nehemiah|5|1|Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
Nehemiah|5|2|For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.
Nehemiah|5|3|Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.
Nehemiah|5|4|our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah|5|5|: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah|5|6|And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
Nehemiah|5|7|Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.
Nehemiah|5|8|And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.
Nehemiah|5|9|Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?
Nehemiah|5|10|And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
Nehemiah|5|11|Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
Nehemiah|5|12|Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
Nehemiah|5|13|Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.
Nehemiah|5|14|, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
Nehemiah|5|15|But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
Nehemiah|5|16|Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.
Nehemiah|5|17|Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.
Nehemiah|5|18|Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
Nehemiah|5|19|
Nehemiah|6|1|Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)
Nehemiah|6|2|the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
Nehemiah|6|3|And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
Nehemiah|6|4|And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
Nehemiah|6|5|Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,
Nehemiah|6|6|wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.
Nehemiah|6|7|And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
Nehemiah|6|8|Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
Nehemiah|6|9|, strengthen thou my hands.
Nehemiah|6|10|And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
Nehemiah|6|11|And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
Nehemiah|6|12|And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah|6|13|For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
Nehemiah|6|14|Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
Nehemiah|6|15|Elul, in fifty and two days.
Nehemiah|6|16|, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
Nehemiah|6|17|of Tobiah came unto them.
Nehemiah|6|18|For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.
Nehemiah|6|19|
Nehemiah|7|1|Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
Nehemiah|7|2|that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
Nehemiah|7|3|over against his house.
Nehemiah|7|4|Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
Nehemiah|7|5|And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:
Nehemiah|7|6|These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;
Nehemiah|7|7|who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Nehemiah|8|1|And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.
Nehemiah|8|2|And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
Nehemiah|8|3|unto the book of the law.
Nehemiah|8|4|Meshullam.
Nehemiah|8|5|And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
Nehemiah|8|6|and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.
Nehemiah|8|7|in their place.
Nehemiah|8|8|And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.
Nehemiah|8|9|And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
Nehemiah|8|10|Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.
Nehemiah|8|11|So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
Nehemiah|8|12|And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
Nehemiah|8|13|of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.
Nehemiah|8|14|And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;
Nehemiah|8|15|and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
Nehemiah|8|16|So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah|8|17|And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
Nehemiah|8|18|
Nehemiah|9|1|Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.
Nehemiah|9|2|And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
Nehemiah|9|3|fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.
Nehemiah|9|4|Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.
Nehemiah|9|5|Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
Nehemiah|9|6|Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
Nehemiah|9|7|Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,
Nehemiah|9|8|and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.
Nehemiah|9|9|And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,
Nehemiah|9|10|and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.
Nehemiah|9|11|And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.
Nehemiah|9|12|Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
Nehemiah|9|13|Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
Nehemiah|9|14|and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,
Nehemiah|9|15|and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
Nehemiah|9|16|But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
Nehemiah|9|17|and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.
Nehemiah|9|18|Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
Nehemiah|9|19|yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
Nehemiah|9|20|Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
Nehemiah|9|21|they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
Nehemiah|9|22|Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
Nehemiah|9|23|Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
Nehemiah|9|24|So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
Nehemiah|9|25|And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
Nehemiah|9|26|Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.
Nehemiah|9|27|Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.
Nehemiah|9|28|But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,
Nehemiah|9|29|and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
Nehemiah|9|30|Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah|9|31|Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
Nehemiah|9|32|Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
Nehemiah|9|33|Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;
Nehemiah|9|34|neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.
Nehemiah|9|35|For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
Nehemiah|9|36|Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.
Nehemiah|9|37|And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.

Nehemiah|10|31|and if the peoples of the land bring wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

Nehemiah|12|39|and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.
Nehemiah|12|40|So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;
Nehemiah|12|41|and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
Nehemiah|12|42|and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
Nehemiah|12|43|And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
Nehemiah|12|44|And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
Nehemiah|12|45|the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
Nehemiah|12|46|For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
Nehemiah|12|47|
Nehemiah|13|1|On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,
Nehemiah|13|2|because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah|13|3|And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
Nehemiah|13|4|Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,
Nehemiah|13|5|had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.
Nehemiah|13|6|I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,
Nehemiah|13|7|and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
Nehemiah|13|8|And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Nehemiah|13|9|Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.
Nehemiah|13|10|And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
Nehemiah|13|11|Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
Nehemiah|13|12|Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
Nehemiah|13|13|And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.
Nehemiah|13|14|Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.
Nehemiah|13|15|in the day wherein they sold victuals.
Nehemiah|13|16|There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah|13|17|Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
Nehemiah|13|18|Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|19|And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
Nehemiah|13|20|So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
Nehemiah|13|21|Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
Nehemiah|13|22|And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.
Nehemiah|13|23|of Moab:
Nehemiah|13|24|and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.
Nehemiah|13|25|, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
Nehemiah|13|26|Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
Nehemiah|13|27|Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
Nehemiah|13|28|And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
Nehemiah|13|29|Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
Nehemiah|13|30|Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;
Nehemiah|13|31|
Ruth|1|1|And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
Ruth|1|2|And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
Ruth|1|3|And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
Ruth|1|4|And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
Ruth|1|5|
Ruth|1|6|Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people in giving them bread.
Ruth|1|7|And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
Ruth|1|8|And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother’s house: Jehovah deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
Ruth|1|9|Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
Ruth|1|10|And they said unto her, Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.
Ruth|1|11|And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Ruth|1|12|Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should even have a husband to-night, and should also bear sons;
Ruth|1|13|would ye therefore tarry till they were grown? would ye therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of Jehovah is gone forth against me.
Ruth|1|14|
Ruth|1|15|And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god: return thou after thy sister-in-law.
Ruth|1|16|And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
Ruth|1|17|where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.
Ruth|1|18|
Ruth|1|19|said, Is this Naomi?
Ruth|1|20|And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
Ruth|1|21|I went out full, and Jehovah hath brought me home again empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
Ruth|1|22|
Ruth|2|1|And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
Ruth|2|2|And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
Ruth|2|3|And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
Ruth|2|4|And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they answered him, Jehovah bless thee.
Ruth|2|5|Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
Ruth|2|6|And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
Ruth|2|7|
Ruth|2|8|Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
Ruth|2|9|Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
Ruth|2|10|Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?
Ruth|2|11|And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.
Ruth|2|12|Jehovah recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
Ruth|2|13|
Ruth|2|14|And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.
Ruth|2|15|And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
Ruth|2|16|
Ruth|2|17|So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
Ruth|2|18|And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
Ruth|2|19|And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.
Ruth|2|20|And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Jehovah, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.
Ruth|2|21|And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
Ruth|2|22|And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.
Ruth|2|23|
Ruth|3|1|And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
Ruth|3|2|And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
Ruth|3|3|Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
Ruth|3|4|And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
Ruth|3|5|
Ruth|3|6|And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.
Ruth|3|7|And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
Ruth|3|8|And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
Ruth|3|9|And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
Ruth|3|10|And he said, Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter: thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
Ruth|3|11|And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a worthy woman.
Ruth|3|12|And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Ruth|3|13|
Ruth|3|14|And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
Ruth|3|15|of barley, and laid it on her: and he went into the city.
Ruth|3|16|And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
Ruth|3|17|of barley gave he me; for he said, Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.
Ruth|3|18|
Ruth|4|1|Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
Ruth|4|2|And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
Ruth|4|3|And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:
Ruth|4|4|And I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
Ruth|4|5|Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
Ruth|4|6|
Ruth|4|7|attestation in Israel.
Ruth|4|8|So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
Ruth|4|9|And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
Ruth|4|10|Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
Ruth|4|11|And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
Ruth|4|12|
Ruth|4|13|So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah gave her conception, and she bare a son.
Ruth|4|14|And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.
Ruth|4|15|And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
Ruth|4|16|And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
Ruth|4|17|
Ruth|4|18|Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,
Ruth|4|19|and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
Ruth|4|20|and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
Ruth|4|21|and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
Ruth|4|22|
Numbers|1|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers|1|2|Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, every male, by their polls;
Numbers|1|3|from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel, thou and Aaron shall number them by their hosts.
Numbers|1|4|And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of his fathers’ house.
Numbers|1|5|And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you. Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers|1|6|Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers|1|7|Of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

Numbers|1|15|Of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|1|16|These are they that were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.
Numbers|1|17|And Moses and Aaron took these men that are mentioned by name:
Numbers|1|18|And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
Numbers|1|19|
Numbers|1|20|And the children of Reuben, Israel’s first-born, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|21|
Numbers|1|22|Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, those that were numbered thereof, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|23|
Numbers|1|24|Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|25|those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad, were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty.
Numbers|1|26|Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|27|
Numbers|1|28|Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|29|
Numbers|1|30|Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|31|
Numbers|1|32|, of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|33|
Numbers|1|34|Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|35|
Numbers|1|36|Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|37|
Numbers|1|38|Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

Numbers|1|42|Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Numbers|1|43|
Numbers|1|44|These are they that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: they were each one for his fathers’ house.
Numbers|1|45|So all they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
Numbers|1|46|
Numbers|1|47|But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
Numbers|1|48|For Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|1|49|Only the tribe of Levi thou shalt not number, neither shalt thou take the sum of them among the children of Israel;
Numbers|1|50|but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
Numbers|1|51|And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
Numbers|1|52|And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
Numbers|1|53|But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
Numbers|1|54|
Numbers|2|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|2|2|The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers’ houses: over against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about.
Numbers|2|3|And those that encamp on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers|2|4|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.
Numbers|2|5|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers|2|6|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|7|the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers|2|8|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|9|
Numbers|2|10|On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers|2|11|And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|12|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers|2|13|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.
Numbers|2|14|And the tribe of Gad: and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.
Numbers|2|15|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.
Numbers|2|16|
Numbers|2|17|
Numbers|2|18|On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|2|19|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|20|And next unto him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers|2|21|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.
Numbers|2|22|And the tribe of Benjamin: and the prince of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.
Numbers|2|23|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|24|
Numbers|2|25|On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers|2|26|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.
Numbers|2|27|And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers|2|28|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.
Numbers|2|29|And the tribe of Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|2|30|And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
Numbers|2|31|
Numbers|2|32|These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses: all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
Numbers|2|33|But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|2|34|
Numbers|3|1|Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spake with Moses in mount Sinai.
Numbers|3|2|And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Numbers|3|3|These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.
Numbers|3|4|

Numbers|3|13|
Numbers|3|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
Numbers|3|15|Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.

Numbers|3|39|
Numbers|3|40|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
Numbers|3|41|And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel:
Numbers|3|42|and Moses numbered, as Jehovah commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel.
Numbers|3|43|
Numbers|3|44|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|3|45|Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah.
Numbers|3|46|the Levites,
Numbers|3|47|thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs):
Numbers|3|48|and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.
Numbers|3|49|And Moses took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites;
Numbers|3|50|, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
Numbers|3|51|
Numbers|4|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|4|2|Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ houses,
Numbers|4|3|from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|4|the most holy things:
Numbers|4|5|when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it,
Numbers|4|6|and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.
Numbers|4|7|And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls and the cups wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall be thereon:
Numbers|4|8|and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in the staves thereof.
Numbers|4|9|And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

Numbers|4|15|And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp is set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|16|
Numbers|4|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|4|18|Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;
Numbers|4|19|but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;
Numbers|4|20|
Numbers|4|21|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|4|22|Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ houses, by their families;
Numbers|4|23|from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to wait upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|24|This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:
Numbers|4|25|they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
Numbers|4|26|and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever shall be done with them: therein shall they serve.
Numbers|4|27|At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden.
Numbers|4|28|
Numbers|4|29|As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers’ houses;
Numbers|4|30|from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|4|31|And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof,
Numbers|4|32|and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden.
Numbers|4|33|
Numbers|4|34|And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers’ houses,

Numbers|4|48|even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore.
Numbers|4|49|
Numbers|5|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|2|Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead:
Numbers|5|3|both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell.
Numbers|5|4|
Numbers|5|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|6|Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Jehovah, and that soul shall be guilty;
Numbers|5|7|then he shall confess his sin which he hath done: and he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him in respect of whom he hath been guilty.
Numbers|5|8|But if the man have no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made unto Jehovah shall be the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.
Numbers|5|9|And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.
Numbers|5|10|
Numbers|5|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|5|12|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
Numbers|5|13|and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she be not taken in the act;
Numbers|5|14|and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
Numbers|5|15|
Numbers|5|16|And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah:
Numbers|5|17|and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water.
Numbers|5|18|And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that causeth the curse.
Numbers|5|19|And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under thy husband, be thou free from this water of bitterness that causeth the curse.
Numbers|5|20|But if thou have gone aside, being under thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee besides thy husband:
Numbers|5|21|then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to fall away, and thy body to swell;
Numbers|5|22|
Numbers|5|23|And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of bitterness:
Numbers|5|24|bitter.
Numbers|5|25|And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal-offering before Jehovah, and bring it unto the altar:
Numbers|5|26|and the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
Numbers|5|27|bitter, and her body shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
Numbers|5|28|
Numbers|5|29|This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goeth aside, and is defiled;
Numbers|5|30|or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
Numbers|5|31|
Numbers|6|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|6|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,
Numbers|6|3|he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
Numbers|6|4|
Numbers|6|5|
Numbers|6|6|All the days that he separateth himself unto Jehovah he shall not come near to a dead body.
Numbers|6|7|He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation unto God is upon his head.
Numbers|6|8|
Numbers|6|9|And if any man die very suddenly beside him, and he defile the head of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
Numbers|6|10|And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|6|11|and the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
Numbers|6|12|
Numbers|6|13|And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|6|14|and he shall offer his oblation unto Jehovah, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
Numbers|6|15|and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.
Numbers|6|16|And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:
Numbers|6|17|and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|6|18|And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Numbers|6|19|his separation;
Numbers|6|20|
Numbers|6|21|
Numbers|6|22|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|6|23|
Numbers|6|24|
Numbers|6|25|
Numbers|6|26|
Numbers|6|27|
Numbers|7|1|And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them;
Numbers|7|2|that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered:
Numbers|7|3|and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.
Numbers|7|4|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|7|5|in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.
Numbers|7|6|And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
Numbers|7|7|Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
Numbers|7|8|and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers|7|9|But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them; they bare it upon their shoulders.
Numbers|7|10|And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their oblation before the altar.
Numbers|7|11|

Numbers|7|89|
Numbers|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|2|Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.
Numbers|8|3|in front of the candlestick, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|8|4|
Numbers|8|5|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|6|Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
Numbers|8|7|And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
Numbers|8|8|Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.
Numbers|8|9|And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel:
Numbers|8|10|and thou shalt present the Levites before Jehovah. And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites:
Numbers|8|11|and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Jehovah.
Numbers|8|12|And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers|8|13|
Numbers|8|14|Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.
Numbers|8|15|And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.
Numbers|8|16|For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
Numbers|8|17|For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
Numbers|8|18|And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.
Numbers|8|19|
Numbers|8|20|Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that Jehovah commanded Moses touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.
Numbers|8|21|And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Numbers|8|22|
Numbers|8|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|8|24|This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting:
Numbers|8|25|and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more,
Numbers|8|26|
Numbers|9|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Numbers|9|2|Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.
Numbers|9|3|In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.
Numbers|9|4|And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
Numbers|9|5|, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
Numbers|9|6|And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
Numbers|9|7|and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
Numbers|9|8|
Numbers|9|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|9|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto Jehovah.
Numbers|9|11|In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:
Numbers|9|12|they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.
Numbers|9|13|But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
Numbers|9|14|
Numbers|9|15|And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
Numbers|9|16|So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
Numbers|9|17|And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
Numbers|9|18|At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
Numbers|9|19|And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.
Numbers|9|20|And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.
Numbers|9|21|by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers|9|22|Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
Numbers|9|23|
Numbers|10|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|10|2|Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them: and thou shalt use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.
Numbers|10|3|And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|10|4|And if they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
Numbers|10|5|And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
Numbers|10|6|And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
Numbers|10|7|But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
Numbers|10|8|And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Numbers|10|9|And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
Numbers|10|10|
Numbers|10|11|And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.
Numbers|10|12|And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers|10|13|And they first took their journey according to the commandment of Jehovah by Moses.
Numbers|10|14|the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Numbers|10|15|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
Numbers|10|16|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
Numbers|10|17|And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bare the tabernacle, set forward.
Numbers|10|18|And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Numbers|10|19|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers|10|20|
Numbers|10|21|did set up the tabernacle against their coming.
Numbers|10|22|And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Numbers|10|23|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers|10|24|
Numbers|10|25|And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers|10|26|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers|10|27|And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers|10|28|
Numbers|10|29|And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good concerning Israel.
Numbers|10|30|And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.
Numbers|10|31|And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
Numbers|10|32|
Numbers|10|33|And they set forward from the mount of Jehovah three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.
Numbers|10|34|And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.
Numbers|10|35|And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
Numbers|10|36|
Numbers|11|1|evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.
Numbers|11|2|And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.
Numbers|11|3|
Numbers|11|4|And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
Numbers|11|5|We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
Numbers|11|6|but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.
Numbers|11|7|And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.
Numbers|11|8|The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
Numbers|11|9|And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
Numbers|11|10|And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.
Numbers|11|11|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
Numbers|11|12|Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
Numbers|11|13|Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
Numbers|11|14|I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
Numbers|11|15|
Numbers|11|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.
Numbers|11|17|And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
Numbers|11|18|And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
Numbers|11|19|Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,
Numbers|11|20|but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
Numbers|11|21|And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
Numbers|11|22|Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
Numbers|11|23|
Numbers|11|24|And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.
Numbers|11|25|
Numbers|11|26|But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
Numbers|11|27|And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
Numbers|11|28|And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
Numbers|11|29|And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah’s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!
Numbers|11|30|
Numbers|11|31|And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
Numbers|11|32|And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
Numbers|11|33|While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.
Numbers|11|34|And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers|11|35|
Numbers|12|1|And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
Numbers|12|2|And they said, Hath Jehovah indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us? And Jehovah heard it.
Numbers|12|3|
Numbers|12|4|And Jehovah spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they three came out.
Numbers|12|5|And Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
Numbers|12|6|And he said, Hear now my words: if there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known unto him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.
Numbers|12|7|My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:
Numbers|12|8|
Numbers|12|9|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them; and he departed.
Numbers|12|10|snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
Numbers|12|11|And Aaron said unto Moses, Oh, my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
Numbers|12|12|Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.
Numbers|12|13|And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, Heal her, O God, I beseech thee.
Numbers|12|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.
Numbers|12|15|
Numbers|12|16|
Numbers|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|13|2|Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.
Numbers|13|3|And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.
Numbers|13|4|And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
Numbers|13|5|Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
Numbers|13|6|Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers|13|7|Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
Numbers|13|8|Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
Numbers|13|9|Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
Numbers|13|10|Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
Numbers|13|11|, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
Numbers|13|12|Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
Numbers|13|13|Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
Numbers|13|14|Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
Numbers|13|15|Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
Numbers|13|16|
Numbers|13|17|And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country:
Numbers|13|18|and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;
Numbers|13|19|and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
Numbers|13|20|
Numbers|13|21|So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
Numbers|13|22|And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
Numbers|13|23|also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
Numbers|13|24|
Numbers|13|25|And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
Numbers|13|26|And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
Numbers|13|27|And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Numbers|13|28|very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
Numbers|13|29|
Numbers|13|30|And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
Numbers|13|31|But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
Numbers|13|32|And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
Numbers|13|33|
Numbers|14|1|And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
Numbers|14|2|And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!
Numbers|14|3|
Numbers|14|4|And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
Numbers|14|5|Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
Numbers|14|6|And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that spied out the land, rent their clothes:
Numbers|14|7|and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.
Numbers|14|8|If Jehovah delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it unto us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
Numbers|14|9|Only rebel not against Jehovah, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is removed from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.
Numbers|14|10|
Numbers|14|11|And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have wrought among them?
Numbers|14|12|
Numbers|14|13|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;
Numbers|14|14|and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people; for thou Jehovah art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
Numbers|14|15|Now if thou shalt kill this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
Numbers|14|16|Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
Numbers|14|17|And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
Numbers|14|18|, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Numbers|14|19|
Numbers|14|20|And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
Numbers|14|21|but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;
Numbers|14|22|because all those men that have seen my glory, and my signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
Numbers|14|23|surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that despised me see it:
Numbers|14|24|but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.
Numbers|14|25|
Numbers|14|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|14|27|with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
Numbers|14|28|Say unto them, As I live, saith Jehovah, surely as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
Numbers|14|29|your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, that have murmured against me,
Numbers|14|30|surely ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|14|31|But your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have rejected.
Numbers|14|32|But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
Numbers|14|33|And your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.
Numbers|14|34|After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my alienation.
Numbers|14|35|
Numbers|14|36|And the men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,
Numbers|14|37|even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.
Numbers|14|38|
Numbers|14|39|And Moses told these words unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
Numbers|14|40|And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up unto the place which Jehovah hath promised: for we have sinned.
Numbers|14|41|And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah, seeing it shall not prosper?
Numbers|14|42|Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten down before your enemies.
Numbers|14|43|For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.
Numbers|14|44|But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
Numbers|14|45|
Numbers|15|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,
Numbers|15|3|and will make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill-offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor unto Jehovah, of the herd, or of the flock;
Numbers|15|4|of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|5|and wine for the drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering, or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
Numbers|15|6|of fine flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|7|and for the drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|8|And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace-offerings unto Jehovah;
Numbers|15|9|of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil:
Numbers|15|10|
Numbers|15|11|Thus shall it be done for each bullock, or for each ram, or for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids.
Numbers|15|12|According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
Numbers|15|13|All that are home-born shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|14|And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; as ye do, so he shall do.
Numbers|15|15|, a statute for ever throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.
Numbers|15|16|
Numbers|15|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|18|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
Numbers|15|19|then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering unto Jehovah.
Numbers|15|20|Of the first of your dough ye shall offer up a cake for a heave-offering: as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
Numbers|15|21|
Numbers|15|22|And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,
Numbers|15|23|even all that Jehovah hath commanded you by Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;
Numbers|15|24|then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah, with the meal-offering thereof, and the drink-offering thereof, according to the ordinance, and one he-goat for a sin-offering.
Numbers|15|25|And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their oblation, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin-offering before Jehovah, for their error:
Numbers|15|26|
Numbers|15|27|And if one person sin unwittingly, then he shall offer a she-goat a year old for a sin-offering.
Numbers|15|28|And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that erreth, when he sinneth unwittingly, before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.
Numbers|15|29|Ye shall have one law for him that doeth aught unwittingly, for him that is home-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
Numbers|15|30|But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, the same blasphemeth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Numbers|15|31|
Numbers|15|32|And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks upon the sabbath day.
Numbers|15|33|And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
Numbers|15|34|And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
Numbers|15|35|And Jehovah said unto Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
Numbers|15|36|
Numbers|15|37|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|15|38|Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each border a cord of blue:
Numbers|15|39|and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye follow not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to play the harlot;
Numbers|15|40|that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
Numbers|15|41|
Numbers|16|1|:
Numbers|16|2|and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;
Numbers|16|3|
Numbers|16|4|And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
Numbers|16|5|and he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.
Numbers|16|6|This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
Numbers|16|7|holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
Numbers|16|8|And Moses said unto Korah, Hear now, ye sons of Levi:
Numbers|16|9|a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;
Numbers|16|10|and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also?
Numbers|16|11|
Numbers|16|12|And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:
Numbers|16|13|is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?
Numbers|16|14|
Numbers|16|15|And Moses was very wroth, and said unto Jehovah, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
Numbers|16|16|And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:
Numbers|16|17|and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each his censer.
Numbers|16|18|And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers|16|19|
Numbers|16|20|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|16|21|Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
Numbers|16|22|And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
Numbers|16|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|24|
Numbers|16|25|And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
Numbers|16|26|And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
Numbers|16|27|So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
Numbers|16|28|of mine own mind.
Numbers|16|29|If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Jehovah hath not sent me.
Numbers|16|30|
Numbers|16|31|And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them;
Numbers|16|32|and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.
Numbers|16|33|So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.
Numbers|16|34|And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
Numbers|16|35|
Numbers|16|36|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|37|Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy,
Numbers|16|38|even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Jehovah; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
Numbers|16|39|And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
Numbers|16|40|
Numbers|16|41|But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.
Numbers|16|42|And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
Numbers|16|43|And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|16|44|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|16|45|Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
Numbers|16|46|And Moses said unto Aaron, Take they censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah; the plague is begun.
Numbers|16|47|And Aaron took as Moses spake, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
Numbers|16|48|And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
Numbers|16|49|Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
Numbers|16|50|
Numbers|17|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|17|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon his rod.
Numbers|17|3|And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.
Numbers|17|4|And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
Numbers|17|5|And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.
Numbers|17|6|And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
Numbers|17|7|
Numbers|17|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.
Numbers|17|9|And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
Numbers|17|10|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.
Numbers|17|11|
Numbers|17|12|And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
Numbers|17|13|
Numbers|18|1|And Jehovah said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’ house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
Numbers|18|2|And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
Numbers|18|3|And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.
Numbers|18|4|And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
Numbers|18|5|And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.
Numbers|18|6|And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|7|
Numbers|18|8|And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.
Numbers|18|9|from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
Numbers|18|10|As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.
Numbers|18|11|And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers|18|12|All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto Jehovah, to thee have I given them.
Numbers|18|13|The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
Numbers|18|14|Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.
Numbers|18|15|Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
Numbers|18|16|And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
Numbers|18|17|But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|18|18|And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
Numbers|18|19|All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before Jehovah unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
Numbers|18|20|
Numbers|18|21|And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|22|And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
Numbers|18|23|But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
Numbers|18|24|
Numbers|18|25|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|18|26|Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.
Numbers|18|27|And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
Numbers|18|28|Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give Jehovah’s heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
Numbers|18|29|Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of Jehovah, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
Numbers|18|30|Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
Numbers|18|31|And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
Numbers|18|32|
Numbers|19|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Numbers|19|2|upon which never came yoke.
Numbers|19|3|And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
Numbers|19|4|and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times.
Numbers|19|5|And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
Numbers|19|6|and the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
Numbers|19|7|Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers|19|8|And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
Numbers|19|9|And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.
Numbers|19|10|
Numbers|19|11|He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:
Numbers|19|12|the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
Numbers|19|13|
Numbers|19|14|This is the law when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and every one that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers|19|15|And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
Numbers|19|16|And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
Numbers|19|17|And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
Numbers|19|18|and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:
Numbers|19|19|
Numbers|19|20|But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water for impurity hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
Numbers|19|21|And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them: and he that sprinkleth the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he that toucheth the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.
Numbers|19|22|
Numbers|20|1|And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
Numbers|20|2|And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
Numbers|20|3|And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!
Numbers|20|4|And why have ye brought the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?
Numbers|20|5|And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
Numbers|20|6|And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto them.
Numbers|20|7|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|20|8|Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.
Numbers|20|9|
Numbers|20|10|And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?
Numbers|20|11|And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
Numbers|20|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
Numbers|20|13|
Numbers|20|14|And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
Numbers|20|15|how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:
Numbers|20|16|and when we cried unto Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
Numbers|20|17|Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers|20|18|And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.
Numbers|20|19|, pass through on my feet.
Numbers|20|20|And he said, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
Numbers|20|21|
Numbers|20|22|And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.
Numbers|20|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
Numbers|20|24|Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
Numbers|20|25|Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;
Numbers|20|26|, and shall die there.
Numbers|20|27|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
Numbers|20|28|And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
Numbers|20|29|
Numbers|21|1|And the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.
Numbers|21|2|And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
Numbers|21|3|
Numbers|21|4|And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
Numbers|21|5|And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
Numbers|21|6|And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
Numbers|21|7|And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee; pray unto Jehovah, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers|21|8|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live.
Numbers|21|9|
Numbers|21|10|And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.
Numbers|21|11|And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
Numbers|21|12|From thence they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
Numbers|21|13|From thence they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that cometh out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Numbers|21|14|
Numbers|21|15|
Numbers|21|16|
Numbers|21|17|
Numbers|21|18|to Mattanah;
Numbers|21|19|and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
Numbers|21|20|
Numbers|21|21|And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Numbers|21|22|Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed thy border.
Numbers|21|23|And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.
Numbers|21|24|And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
Numbers|21|25|And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns thereof.
Numbers|21|26|For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.
Numbers|21|27|
Numbers|21|28|
Numbers|21|29|
Numbers|21|30|
Numbers|21|31|Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers|21|32|
Numbers|21|33|And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
Numbers|21|34|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
Numbers|21|35|
Numbers|22|1|
Numbers|22|2|And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers|22|3|And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
Numbers|22|4|And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
Numbers|22|5|And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
Numbers|22|6|
Numbers|22|7|And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
Numbers|22|8|And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Jehovah shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
Numbers|22|9|And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
Numbers|22|10|,
Numbers|22|11|Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.
Numbers|22|12|And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.
Numbers|22|13|And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
Numbers|22|14|
Numbers|22|15|And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
Numbers|22|16|And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:
Numbers|22|17|for I will promote thee unto very great honor, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
Numbers|22|18|And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
Numbers|22|19|Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what Jehovah will speak unto me more.
Numbers|22|20|
Numbers|22|21|And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
Numbers|22|22|And God’s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Jehovah placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
Numbers|22|23|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
Numbers|22|24|Then the angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
Numbers|22|25|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
Numbers|22|26|And the angel of Jehovah went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
Numbers|22|27|And the ass saw the angel of Jehovah, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
Numbers|22|28|And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
Numbers|22|29|And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.
Numbers|22|30|
Numbers|22|31|Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Jehovah standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
Numbers|22|32|And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is perverse before me:
Numbers|22|33|and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.
Numbers|22|34|And Balaam said unto the angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
Numbers|22|35|
Numbers|22|36|And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
Numbers|22|37|And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
Numbers|22|38|And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
Numbers|22|39|And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.
Numbers|22|40|
Numbers|22|41|
Numbers|23|1|And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers|23|2|And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
Numbers|23|3|And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: peradventure Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a bare height.
Numbers|23|4|And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers|23|5|And Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
Numbers|23|6|And he returned unto him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
Numbers|23|7|And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram hath Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse me Jacob, And come, defy Israel.
Numbers|23|8|How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Jehovah hath not defied?
Numbers|23|9|Lo, it is a people that dwelleth alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.
Numbers|23|10|Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!
Numbers|23|11|And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
Numbers|23|12|
Numbers|23|13|And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
Numbers|23|14|And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
Numbers|23|15|yonder.
Numbers|23|16|And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
Numbers|23|17|And he came to him, and, lo, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath Jehovah spoken?

Numbers|23|21|
Numbers|23|22|
Numbers|23|23|
Numbers|23|24|
Numbers|23|25|And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
Numbers|23|26|But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that Jehovah speaketh, that I must do?
Numbers|23|27|And Balak said unto Balaam, Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
Numbers|23|28|And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.
Numbers|23|29|And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
Numbers|23|30|
Numbers|24|1|And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
Numbers|24|2|And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.

Numbers|24|6|
Numbers|24|7|
Numbers|24|8|
Numbers|24|9|
Numbers|24|10|And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
Numbers|24|11|Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honor; but, lo, Jehovah hath kept thee back from honor.
Numbers|24|12|And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers that thou sentest unto me, saying,
Numbers|24|13|If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; what Jehovah speaketh, that will I speak?
Numbers|24|14|I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.

Numbers|25|1|And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play the harlot with the daughters of Moab:
Numbers|25|2|for they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
Numbers|25|3|And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.
Numbers|25|4|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up unto Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.
Numbers|25|5|
Numbers|25|6|And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
Numbers|25|7|And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;
Numbers|25|8|and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
Numbers|25|9|
Numbers|25|10|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|25|11|Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
Numbers|25|12|Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
Numbers|25|13|
Numbers|25|14|Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.
Numbers|25|15|
Numbers|25|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|25|17|Vex the Midianites, and smite them;
Numbers|25|18|
Numbers|26|1|And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
Numbers|26|2|Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel.
Numbers|26|3|And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

Numbers|26|8|And the sons of Pallu: Eliab.
Numbers|26|9|And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against Jehovah,
Numbers|26|10|and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign.

Numbers|26|51|
Numbers|26|52|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|26|53|Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.
Numbers|26|54|To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one according to those that were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given.
Numbers|26|55|Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
Numbers|26|56|
Numbers|26|57|And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

Numbers|26|60|And unto Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers|26|61|And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.
Numbers|26|62|
Numbers|26|63|These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|26|64|But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers|26|65|
Numbers|27|1|Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
Numbers|27|2|And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,
Numbers|27|3|Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.
Numbers|27|4|Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.
Numbers|27|5|
Numbers|27|6|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|27|7|The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
Numbers|27|8|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
Numbers|27|9|And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
Numbers|27|10|And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
Numbers|27|11|
Numbers|27|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
Numbers|27|13|And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;
Numbers|27|14|because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
Numbers|27|15|And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,
Numbers|27|16|Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
Numbers|27|17|who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
Numbers|27|18|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;
Numbers|27|19|and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
Numbers|27|20|And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.
Numbers|27|21|And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
Numbers|27|22|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
Numbers|27|23|
Numbers|28|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|28|2|Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
Numbers|28|3|And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|4|The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
Numbers|28|5|and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
Numbers|28|6|It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|7|And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|8|
Numbers|28|9|of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:
Numbers|28|10|
Numbers|28|11|And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|28|12|of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;
Numbers|28|13|and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|14|And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers|28|15|
Numbers|28|16|And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah’s passover.
Numbers|28|17|And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
Numbers|28|18|In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;
Numbers|28|19|but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;
Numbers|28|20|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;
Numbers|28|21|a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
Numbers|28|22|and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
Numbers|28|23|Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|24|After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|25|
Numbers|28|26|weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;
Numbers|28|27|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;
Numbers|28|28|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,
Numbers|28|29|a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
Numbers|28|30|one he-goat, to make atonement for you.
Numbers|28|31|
Numbers|29|1|And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you.
Numbers|29|2|And ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|29|3|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,
Numbers|29|4|and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
Numbers|29|5|and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you;
Numbers|29|6|
Numbers|29|7|And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work;
Numbers|29|8|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;
Numbers|29|9|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,
Numbers|29|10|a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs:
Numbers|29|11|
Numbers|29|12|And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall keep a feast unto Jehovah seven days:
Numbers|29|13|and ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah; thirteen young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish;
Numbers|29|14|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for every bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,
Numbers|29|15|and a tenth part for every lamb of the fourteen lambs;
Numbers|29|16|
Numbers|29|17|twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|29|18|and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;
Numbers|29|19|
Numbers|29|20|And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|29|21|and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;

Numbers|29|23|And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|29|24|their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;

Numbers|29|27|and their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number, after the ordinance;
Numbers|29|28|
Numbers|29|29|And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs a year old without blemish;

Numbers|29|34|
Numbers|29|35|On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do no servile work;
Numbers|29|36|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: one bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|29|37|their meal-offering and their drink-offerings for the bullock, for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number, after the ordinance:
Numbers|29|38|
Numbers|29|39|These ye shall offer unto Jehovah in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your freewill-offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your meal-offerings, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.
Numbers|29|40|
Numbers|30|1|And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded.
Numbers|30|2|When a man voweth a vow unto Jehovah, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
Numbers|30|3|Also when a woman voweth a vow unto Jehovah, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth,
Numbers|30|4|and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|5|
Numbers|30|6|to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul,
Numbers|30|7|and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|8|But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it, then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and Jehovah will forgive her.
Numbers|30|9|everything wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.
Numbers|30|10|And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
Numbers|30|11|and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
Numbers|30|12|
Numbers|30|13|Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
Numbers|30|14|But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day, then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
Numbers|30|15|But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
Numbers|30|16|
Numbers|31|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|31|2|Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
Numbers|31|3|And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah’s vengeance on Midian.
Numbers|31|4|Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
Numbers|31|5|So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
Numbers|31|6|And Moses sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
Numbers|31|7|And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they slew every male.
Numbers|31|8|And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
Numbers|31|9|And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.
Numbers|31|10|And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
Numbers|31|11|And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
Numbers|31|12|
Numbers|31|13|And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
Numbers|31|14|And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
Numbers|31|15|And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
Numbers|31|16|Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of Jehovah.
Numbers|31|17|Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
Numbers|31|18|But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
Numbers|31|19|And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.
Numbers|31|20|
Numbers|31|21|And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses:
Numbers|31|22|howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Numbers|31|23|everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.
Numbers|31|24|
Numbers|31|25|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|31|26|of the congregation;
Numbers|31|27|and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.
Numbers|31|28|of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks:
Numbers|31|29|take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah’s heave-offering.
Numbers|31|30|of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.
Numbers|31|31|
Numbers|31|32|Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
Numbers|31|33|and threescore and twelve thousand oxen,
Numbers|31|34|and threescore and one thousand asses,
Numbers|31|35|and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.
Numbers|31|36|And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep:
Numbers|31|37|and Jehovah’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
Numbers|31|38|And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and twelve.
Numbers|31|39|And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which Jehovah’s tribute was threescore and one.
Numbers|31|40|And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Jehovah’s tribute was thirty and two persons.
Numbers|31|41|
Numbers|31|42|And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men that warred
Numbers|31|43|(now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
Numbers|31|44|and thirty and six thousand oxen,
Numbers|31|45|and thirty thousand and five hundred asses,
Numbers|31|46|and sixteen thousand persons),
Numbers|31|47|
Numbers|31|48|And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses;
Numbers|31|49|and they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
Numbers|31|50|And we have brought Jehovah’s oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.
Numbers|31|51|And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
Numbers|31|52|And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Jehovah, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
Numbers|31|53|the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
Numbers|31|54|
Numbers|32|1|Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
Numbers|32|2|the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
Numbers|32|3|Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
Numbers|32|4|the land which Jehovah smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle; and thy servants have cattle.
Numbers|32|5|
Numbers|32|6|And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to the war, and shall ye sit here?
Numbers|32|7|And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah hath given them?
Numbers|32|8|Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
Numbers|32|9|For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.
Numbers|32|10|And Jehovah’s anger was kindled in that day, and he sware, saying,
Numbers|32|11|Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
Numbers|32|12|save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Jehovah.
Numbers|32|13|And Jehovah’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Jehovah, was consumed.
Numbers|32|14|And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.
Numbers|32|15|
Numbers|32|16|And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
Numbers|32|17|but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
Numbers|32|18|We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
Numbers|32|19|
Numbers|32|20|And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves to go before Jehovah to the war,
Numbers|32|21|and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
Numbers|32|22|and the land is subdued before Jehovah; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless towards Jehovah, and towards Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before Jehovah.
Numbers|32|23|But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah; and be sure your sin will find you out.
Numbers|32|24|Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
Numbers|32|25|And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
Numbers|32|26|Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
Numbers|32|27|
Numbers|32|28|of the tribes of the children of Israel.
Numbers|32|29|And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man that is armed to battle, before Jehovah, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
Numbers|32|30|but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
Numbers|32|31|And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
Numbers|32|32|
Numbers|32|33|borders, even the cities of the land round about.
Numbers|32|34|And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
Numbers|32|35|and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,
Numbers|32|36|and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
Numbers|32|37|And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
Numbers|32|38|and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
Numbers|32|39|And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.
Numbers|32|40|And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
Numbers|32|41|And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns thereof, and called them Havvoth-jair.
Numbers|32|42|
Numbers|33|1|These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Numbers|33|49|
Numbers|33|50|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers|33|51|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers|33|52|, and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all their high places:
Numbers|33|53|and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein; for unto you have I given the land to possess it.
Numbers|33|54|And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
Numbers|33|55|But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides, and they shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.
Numbers|33|56|
Numbers|34|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|34|2|Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof),
Numbers|34|3|then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;
Numbers|34|4|and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;
Numbers|34|5|
Numbers|34|6|
Numbers|34|7|And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;
Numbers|34|8|from mount Hor ye shall mark out unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;
Numbers|34|9|
Numbers|34|10|And ye shall mark out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;
Numbers|34|11|and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
Numbers|34|12|
Numbers|34|13|And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;
Numbers|34|14|for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’ houses, have received, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:
Numbers|34|15|
Numbers|34|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|34|17|These are the names of the men that shall divide the land unto you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|34|18|And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.

Numbers|34|29|
Numbers|35|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Numbers|35|2|Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and suburbs for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.
Numbers|35|3|And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their substance, and for all their beasts.
Numbers|35|4|And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
Numbers|35|5|And ye shall measure without the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst. This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
Numbers|35|6|And the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which ye shall give for the manslayer to flee unto: and besides them ye shall give forty and two cities.
Numbers|35|7|with their suburbs.
Numbers|35|8|And concerning the cities which ye shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many ye shall take many; and from the few ye shall take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inheriteth shall give of his cities unto the Levites.
Numbers|35|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|35|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
Numbers|35|11|then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|12|And the cities shall be unto you for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation for judgment.
Numbers|35|13|And the cities which ye shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|14|Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
Numbers|35|15|For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, shall these six cities be for refuge; that every one that killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither.
Numbers|35|16|But if he smote him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|17|And if he smote him with a stone in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|18|Or if he smote him with a weapon of wood in the hand, whereby a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|19|The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death: when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
Numbers|35|20|And if he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,
Numbers|35|21|
Numbers|35|22|But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled upon him anything without lying in wait,
Numbers|35|23|or with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm;
Numbers|35|24|then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;
Numbers|35|25|and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers|35|26|But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, whither he fleeth,
Numbers|35|27|and the avenger of blood find him without the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the manslayer; he shall not be guilty of blood,
Numbers|35|28|
Numbers|35|29|ordinance unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Numbers|35|30|Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die.
Numbers|35|31|Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
Numbers|35|32|And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
Numbers|35|33|So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood, it polluteth the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
Numbers|35|34|
Numbers|36|1|of the children of Israel:
Numbers|36|2|and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
Numbers|36|3|tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
Numbers|36|4|
Numbers|36|5|And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaketh right.
Numbers|36|6|This is the thing which Jehovah doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married.
Numbers|36|7|So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Numbers|36|8|And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.
Numbers|36|9|
Numbers|36|10|Even as Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
Numbers|36|11|for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons.
Numbers|36|12|
Numbers|36|13|
Exodus|1|1|Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):
Exodus|1|2|Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
Exodus|1|3|Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exodus|1|4|Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
Exodus|1|5|And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.
Exodus|1|6|And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
Exodus|1|7|
Exodus|1|8|Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Exodus|1|9|And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Exodus|1|10|come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
Exodus|1|11|Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus|1|12|But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
Exodus|1|13|And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:
Exodus|1|14|
Exodus|1|15|And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
Exodus|1|16|and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
Exodus|1|17|But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.
Exodus|1|18|And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?
Exodus|1|19|And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.
Exodus|1|20|And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
Exodus|1|21|And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.
Exodus|1|22|
Exodus|2|1|And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
Exodus|2|2|And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
Exodus|2|3|And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.
Exodus|2|4|And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
Exodus|2|5|And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
Exodus|2|6|And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
Exodus|2|7|Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
Exodus|2|8|And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child’s mother.
Exodus|2|9|And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
Exodus|2|10|
Exodus|2|11|And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
Exodus|2|12|And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
Exodus|2|13|And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
Exodus|2|14|And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
Exodus|2|15|
Exodus|2|16|Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
Exodus|2|17|And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
Exodus|2|18|And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?
Exodus|2|19|And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
Exodus|2|20|And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
Exodus|2|21|And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
Exodus|2|22|
Exodus|2|23|And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
Exodus|2|24|And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

Exodus|3|1|Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.
Exodus|3|2|And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
Exodus|3|3|And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
Exodus|3|4|And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
Exodus|3|5|And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Exodus|3|6|Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
Exodus|3|7|And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
Exodus|3|8|and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus|3|9|And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
Exodus|3|10|Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

Exodus|3|14|And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
Exodus|3|15|And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
Exodus|3|16|that which is done to you in Egypt:
Exodus|3|17|and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
Exodus|3|18|And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
Exodus|3|19|And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
Exodus|3|20|And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
Exodus|3|21|And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
Exodus|3|22|
Exodus|4|1|And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee.
Exodus|4|2|And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
Exodus|4|3|And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
Exodus|4|4|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)
Exodus|4|5|That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

Exodus|4|9|
Exodus|4|10|And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
Exodus|4|11|dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
Exodus|4|12|Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.
Exodus|4|13|And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
Exodus|4|14|And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
Exodus|4|15|And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
Exodus|4|16|And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.

Exodus|4|18|And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

Exodus|5|1|And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
Exodus|5|2|And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.
Exodus|5|3|And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
Exodus|5|4|And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
Exodus|5|5|And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
Exodus|5|6|And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
Exodus|5|7|Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
Exodus|5|8|And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Exodus|5|9|
Exodus|5|10|And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
Exodus|5|11|Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.
Exodus|5|12|So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
Exodus|5|13|daily tasks, as when there was straw.
Exodus|5|14|
Exodus|5|15|Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
Exodus|5|16|There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.
Exodus|5|17|But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
Exodus|5|18|Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
Exodus|5|19|daily tasks.
Exodus|5|20|And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:

Exodus|5|23|
Exodus|6|1|
Exodus|6|2|And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:
Exodus|6|3|and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.
Exodus|6|4|And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
Exodus|6|5|And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
Exodus|6|6|Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
Exodus|6|7|and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

Exodus|6|11|Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus|6|12|And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

Exodus|6|30|
Exodus|7|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
Exodus|7|2|Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
Exodus|7|3|And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|7|4|But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
Exodus|7|5|And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
Exodus|7|6|And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they.
Exodus|7|7|
Exodus|7|8|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Exodus|7|9|When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
Exodus|7|10|And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
Exodus|7|11|Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
Exodus|7|12|For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
Exodus|7|13|
Exodus|7|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go.
Exodus|7|15|Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
Exodus|7|16|And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.
Exodus|7|17|Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
Exodus|7|18|And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
Exodus|7|19|
Exodus|7|20|And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
Exodus|7|21|And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|7|22|And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
Exodus|7|23|And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.
Exodus|7|24|And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
Exodus|7|25|
Exodus|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|8|2|And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
Exodus|8|3|and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:
Exodus|8|4|and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
Exodus|8|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|6|And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|7|
Exodus|8|8|Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.
Exodus|8|9|And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?
Exodus|8|10|And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God.
Exodus|8|11|And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
Exodus|8|12|And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.
Exodus|8|13|And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
Exodus|8|14|And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.
Exodus|8|15|
Exodus|8|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|17|And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|8|18|And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
Exodus|8|19|
Exodus|8|20|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|8|21|Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
Exodus|8|22|And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
Exodus|8|23|And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be.
Exodus|8|24|
Exodus|8|25|And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
Exodus|8|26|And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
Exodus|8|27|We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.
Exodus|8|28|And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
Exodus|8|29|And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
Exodus|8|30|And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
Exodus|8|31|And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
Exodus|8|32|
Exodus|9|1|Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|9|2|For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
Exodus|9|3|a very grievous murrain.
Exodus|9|4|And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.
Exodus|9|5|And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.
Exodus|9|6|And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
Exodus|9|7|
Exodus|9|8|And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
Exodus|9|9|And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|10|And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
Exodus|9|11|And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
Exodus|9|12|And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.
Exodus|9|13|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|9|14|For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
Exodus|9|15|For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:
Exodus|9|16|but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
Exodus|9|17|As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
Exodus|9|18|Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
Exodus|9|19|every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
Exodus|9|20|He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
Exodus|9|21|
Exodus|9|22|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|23|And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus|9|24|So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
Exodus|9|25|And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
Exodus|9|26|
Exodus|9|27|And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
Exodus|9|28|mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
Exodus|9|29|And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah’s.
Exodus|9|30|But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.
Exodus|9|31|And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
Exodus|9|32|But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
Exodus|9|33|And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
Exodus|9|34|And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
Exodus|9|35|
Exodus|10|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,
Exodus|10|2|and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
Exodus|10|3|And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
Exodus|10|4|Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:
Exodus|10|5|and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
Exodus|10|6|and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
Exodus|10|7|And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
Exodus|10|8|And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?
Exodus|10|9|And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.
Exodus|10|10|And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
Exodus|10|11|
Exodus|10|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
Exodus|10|13|And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
Exodus|10|14|And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
Exodus|10|15|For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Exodus|10|16|Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
Exodus|10|17|Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
Exodus|10|18|And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
Exodus|10|19|And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.
Exodus|10|20|
Exodus|10|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
Exodus|10|22|And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;
Exodus|10|23|they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
Exodus|10|24|And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
Exodus|10|25|And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.
Exodus|10|26|Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.
Exodus|10|27|But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
Exodus|10|28|And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
Exodus|10|29|
Exodus|11|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
Exodus|11|2|Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
Exodus|11|3|
Exodus|11|4|And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
Exodus|11|5|and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.
Exodus|11|6|And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.
Exodus|11|7|But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
Exodus|11|8|
Exodus|11|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|11|10|
Exodus|12|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
Exodus|12|2|This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Exodus|12|3|of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household:
Exodus|12|4|and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.
Exodus|12|5|Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
Exodus|12|6|and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.
Exodus|12|7|And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.
Exodus|12|8|And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Exodus|12|9|Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.
Exodus|12|10|And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
Exodus|12|11|And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah’s passover.
Exodus|12|12|For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah.
Exodus|12|13|And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
Exodus|12|14|
Exodus|12|15|Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
Exodus|12|16|And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
Exodus|12|17|unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever.
Exodus|12|18|, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
Exodus|12|19|Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.
Exodus|12|20|
Exodus|12|21|Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.
Exodus|12|22|And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
Exodus|12|23|For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
Exodus|12|24|And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
Exodus|12|25|And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
Exodus|12|26|And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
Exodus|12|27|that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
Exodus|12|28|
Exodus|12|29|And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
Exodus|12|30|And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
Exodus|12|31|And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.
Exodus|12|32|Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
Exodus|12|33|And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.
Exodus|12|34|And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
Exodus|12|35|And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
Exodus|12|36|
Exodus|12|37|And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.
Exodus|12|38|And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
Exodus|12|39|And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
Exodus|12|40|Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus|12|41|And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.
Exodus|12|42|
Exodus|12|43|And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;
Exodus|12|44|but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
Exodus|12|45|A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
Exodus|12|46|In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
Exodus|12|47|All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
Exodus|12|48|And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
Exodus|12|49|One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
Exodus|12|50|Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
Exodus|12|51|
Exodus|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|13|2|
Exodus|13|3|And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
Exodus|13|4|This day ye go forth in the month Abib.
Exodus|13|5|And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
Exodus|13|6|Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.
Exodus|13|7|Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.
Exodus|13|8|And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.
Exodus|13|9|And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.
Exodus|13|10|
Exodus|13|11|And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
Exodus|13|12|that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah’s.
Exodus|13|13|And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.
Exodus|13|14|And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
Exodus|13|15|and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.
Exodus|13|16|
Exodus|13|17|And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
Exodus|13|18|but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|13|19|And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
Exodus|13|20|And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus|13|21|And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
Exodus|13|22|
Exodus|14|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|14|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.
Exodus|14|3|And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
Exodus|14|4|And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.
Exodus|14|5|And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
Exodus|14|6|And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
Exodus|14|7|and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
Exodus|14|8|And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
Exodus|14|9|
Exodus|14|10|And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.
Exodus|14|11|And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
Exodus|14|12|Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
Exodus|14|13|And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
Exodus|14|14|
Exodus|14|15|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
Exodus|14|16|And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
Exodus|14|17|And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
Exodus|14|18|And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
Exodus|14|19|And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:
Exodus|14|20|
Exodus|14|21|by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
Exodus|14|22|And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
Exodus|14|23|And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Exodus|14|24|And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.
Exodus|14|25|
Exodus|14|26|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
Exodus|14|27|And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
Exodus|14|28|And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.
Exodus|14|29|But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
Exodus|14|30|Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.

Exodus|15|19|For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
Exodus|15|20|And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
Exodus|15|21|
Exodus|15|22|And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
Exodus|15|23|And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
Exodus|15|24|And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
Exodus|15|25|An he cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;
Exodus|15|26|and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah that healeth thee.
Exodus|15|27|
Exodus|16|1|And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|16|2|And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:
Exodus|16|3|
Exodus|16|4|Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
Exodus|16|5|And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
Exodus|16|6|And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;
Exodus|16|7|and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
Exodus|16|8|, when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.
Exodus|16|9|And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings.
Exodus|16|10|And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
Exodus|16|11|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|16|12|
Exodus|16|13|And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
Exodus|16|14|And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground.
Exodus|16|15|And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.
Exodus|16|16|This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.
Exodus|16|17|And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
Exodus|16|18|And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
Exodus|16|19|And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
Exodus|16|20|Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.
Exodus|16|21|And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
Exodus|16|22|And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
Exodus|16|23|And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
Exodus|16|24|And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.
Exodus|16|25|And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.
Exodus|16|26|Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
Exodus|16|27|And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.
Exodus|16|28|And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
Exodus|16|29|See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
Exodus|16|30|
Exodus|16|31|with honey.
Exodus|16|32|And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
Exodus|16|33|And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.
Exodus|16|34|As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
Exodus|16|35|And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
Exodus|16|36|
Exodus|17|1|And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
Exodus|17|2|Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?
Exodus|17|3|And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
Exodus|17|4|And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
Exodus|17|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
Exodus|17|6|Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|17|7|
Exodus|17|8|Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus|17|9|And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
Exodus|17|10|So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
Exodus|17|11|And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
Exodus|17|12|But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
Exodus|17|13|And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
Exodus|17|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
Exodus|17|15|And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;
Exodus|17|16|
Exodus|18|1|Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus|18|2|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away,
Exodus|18|3|and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:
Exodus|18|4|, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
Exodus|18|5|And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:
Exodus|18|6|and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
Exodus|18|7|And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
Exodus|18|8|And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.
Exodus|18|9|And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|10|And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus|18|11|Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
Exodus|18|12|
Exodus|18|13|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.
Exodus|18|14|And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?
Exodus|18|15|And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
Exodus|18|16|when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
Exodus|18|17|And Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
Exodus|18|18|Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
Exodus|18|19|Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:
Exodus|18|20|and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
Exodus|18|21|Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
Exodus|18|22|with thee.
Exodus|18|23|If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
Exodus|18|24|So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
Exodus|18|25|And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
Exodus|18|26|And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
Exodus|18|27|
Exodus|19|1|In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
Exodus|19|2|And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
Exodus|19|3|And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
Exodus|19|4|Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.
Exodus|19|5|Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:
Exodus|19|6|
Exodus|19|7|And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.
Exodus|19|8|And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.
Exodus|19|10|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,
Exodus|19|11|and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
Exodus|19|12|And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
Exodus|19|13|no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
Exodus|19|14|And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
Exodus|19|15|
Exodus|19|16|And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
Exodus|19|17|And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
Exodus|19|18|And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
Exodus|19|19|And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
Exodus|19|20|And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
Exodus|19|21|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
Exodus|19|22|And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|23|And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
Exodus|19|24|And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.
Exodus|19|25|
Exodus|20|1|And God spake all these words, saying,
Exodus|20|2|I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Exodus|20|3|
Exodus|20|4|that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
Exodus|20|5|Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
Exodus|20|6|
Exodus|20|7|
Exodus|20|8|Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Exodus|20|9|Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
Exodus|20|10|thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
Exodus|20|11|
Exodus|20|12|
Exodus|20|13|
Exodus|20|14|
Exodus|20|15|
Exodus|20|16|
Exodus|20|17|
Exodus|20|18|And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
Exodus|20|19|And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
Exodus|20|20|And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
Exodus|20|21|
Exodus|20|22|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
Exodus|20|23|with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
Exodus|20|24|An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
Exodus|20|25|And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
Exodus|20|26|
Exodus|21|1|
Exodus|21|2|If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
Exodus|21|3|If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
Exodus|21|4|If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
Exodus|21|5|But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
Exodus|21|6|
Exodus|21|7|And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.
Exodus|21|8|If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
Exodus|21|9|And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
Exodus|21|10|; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
Exodus|21|11|
Exodus|21|12|He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|21|13|into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
Exodus|21|14|
Exodus|21|15|
Exodus|21|16|
Exodus|21|17|
Exodus|21|18|And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;

Exodus|21|20|And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.
Exodus|21|21|
Exodus|21|22|And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
Exodus|21|23|But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
Exodus|21|24|eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
Exodus|21|25|
Exodus|21|26|And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.
Exodus|21|27|
Exodus|21|28|And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
Exodus|21|29|But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
Exodus|21|30|If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
Exodus|21|31|Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
Exodus|21|32|
Exodus|21|33|And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
Exodus|21|34|
Exodus|21|35|And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide.
Exodus|21|36|
Exodus|22|1|If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
Exodus|22|2|If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
Exodus|22|3|If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
Exodus|22|4|
Exodus|22|5|
Exodus|22|6|
Exodus|22|7|If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.
Exodus|22|8|whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods.
Exodus|22|9|
Exodus|22|10|If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
Exodus|22|11|the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
Exodus|22|12|But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
Exodus|22|13|
Exodus|22|14|And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.

Exodus|22|18|
Exodus|22|19|
Exodus|22|20|He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.
Exodus|22|21|And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Exodus|22|22|Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
Exodus|22|23|If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
Exodus|22|24|
Exodus|22|25|If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.
Exodus|22|26|If thou at all take thy neighbor’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:
Exodus|22|27|
Exodus|22|28|Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
Exodus|22|29|Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
Exodus|22|30|with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
Exodus|22|31|
Exodus|23|1|Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
Exodus|23|2|:
Exodus|23|3|
Exodus|23|4|If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
Exodus|23|5|
Exodus|23|6|to thy poor in his cause.
Exodus|23|7|Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
Exodus|23|8|And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
Exodus|23|9|
Exodus|23|10|And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:
Exodus|23|11|with thy oliveyard.
Exodus|23|12|Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.
Exodus|23|13|
Exodus|23|14|Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
Exodus|23|15|The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:
Exodus|23|16|and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.
Exodus|23|17|
Exodus|23|18|Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
Exodus|23|19|
Exodus|23|20|Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
Exodus|23|21|Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him.
Exodus|23|22|But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
Exodus|23|23|For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.
Exodus|23|24|Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.
Exodus|23|25|And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
Exodus|23|26|There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
Exodus|23|27|I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
Exodus|23|28|And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
Exodus|23|29|I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
Exodus|23|30|By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
Exodus|23|31|And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
Exodus|23|32|Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
Exodus|23|33|
Exodus|24|1|And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:
Exodus|24|2|and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.
Exodus|24|3|And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.
Exodus|24|4|And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
Exodus|24|5|And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah.
Exodus|24|6|And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
Exodus|24|7|And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.
Exodus|24|8|
Exodus|24|9|Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
Exodus|24|10|And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
Exodus|24|11|
Exodus|24|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.
Exodus|24|13|And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
Exodus|24|14|And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.
Exodus|24|15|And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.
Exodus|24|16|And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
Exodus|24|17|And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
Exodus|24|18|
Exodus|25|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|25|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering.
Exodus|25|3|And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,
Exodus|25|4|,
Exodus|25|5|and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,
Exodus|25|6|oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,

Exodus|25|20|And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.
Exodus|25|21|And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
Exodus|25|22|

Exodus|30|12|When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
Exodus|30|13|This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.
Exodus|30|14|Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.

Exodus|30|16|
Exodus|30|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|30|18|Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
Exodus|30|19|And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
Exodus|30|20|when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Exodus|30|21|
Exodus|30|22|Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|30|23|, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,
Exodus|30|24|and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
Exodus|30|25|And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
Exodus|30|26|And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,
Exodus|30|27|and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,

Exodus|30|32|it shall be holy unto you.
Exodus|30|33|
Exodus|30|34|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;
Exodus|30|35|holy:
Exodus|30|36|and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
Exodus|30|37|And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah.
Exodus|30|38|
Exodus|31|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|31|2|See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
Exodus|31|3|and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
Exodus|31|4|to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
Exodus|31|5|and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
Exodus|31|6|And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
Exodus|31|7|the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,
Exodus|31|8|and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,
Exodus|31|9|and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
Exodus|31|10|and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office,
Exodus|31|11|
Exodus|31|12|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Exodus|31|13|Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.
Exodus|31|14|Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Exodus|31|15|Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
Exodus|31|16|Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
Exodus|31|17|
Exodus|31|18|
Exodus|32|1|And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Exodus|32|2|And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
Exodus|32|3|And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
Exodus|32|4|And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|32|5|, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.
Exodus|32|6|
Exodus|32|7|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
Exodus|32|8|they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus|32|9|And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Exodus|32|10|now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
Exodus|32|11|And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Exodus|32|12|Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
Exodus|32|13|Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
Exodus|32|14|
Exodus|32|15|And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
Exodus|32|16|And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
Exodus|32|17|And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
Exodus|32|18|And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
Exodus|32|19|And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
Exodus|32|20|
Exodus|32|21|And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?
Exodus|32|22|on evil.
Exodus|32|23|For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Exodus|32|24|
Exodus|32|25|And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)
Exodus|32|26|unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
Exodus|32|27|And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
Exodus|32|28|And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
Exodus|32|29|
Exodus|32|30|And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.
Exodus|32|31|And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
Exodus|32|32|Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
Exodus|32|33|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
Exodus|32|34|of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
Exodus|32|35|
Exodus|33|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
Exodus|33|2|and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Exodus|33|3|unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.
Exodus|33|4|And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
Exodus|33|5|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
Exodus|33|6|
Exodus|33|7|Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.
Exodus|33|8|And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.
Exodus|33|9|spake with Moses.
Exodus|33|10|And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.
Exodus|33|11|
Exodus|33|12|And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.
Exodus|33|13|Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
Exodus|33|14|, and I will give thee rest.
Exodus|33|15|, carry us not up hence.
Exodus|33|16|
Exodus|33|17|And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.
Exodus|33|18|And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.
Exodus|33|19|And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
Exodus|33|20|And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live.
Exodus|33|21|and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:
Exodus|33|22|and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:
Exodus|33|23|
Exodus|34|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.
Exodus|34|2|And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
Exodus|34|3|And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
Exodus|34|4|And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.
Exodus|34|5|And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
Exodus|34|6|And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,
Exodus|34|7|, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
Exodus|34|8|And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
Exodus|34|9|
Exodus|34|10|And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.
Exodus|34|11|Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Exodus|34|12|Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
Exodus|34|13|but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;
Exodus|34|14|for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
Exodus|34|15|lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;
Exodus|34|16|and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.
Exodus|34|17|

Exodus|34|28|
Exodus|34|29|And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
Exodus|34|30|And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
Exodus|34|31|And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.
Exodus|34|32|And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
Exodus|34|33|And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

Exodus|34|35|
Exodus|35|1|And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them.

Exodus|35|3|
Exodus|35|4|And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,

Exodus|35|21|brought Jehovah’s offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.
Exodus|35|22|brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah.

Exodus|36|1|
Exodus|36|2|And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
Exodus|36|3|and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning.
Exodus|36|4|And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.
Exodus|36|5|And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.
Exodus|36|6|And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

Exodus|40|3|And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.
Exodus|40|4|And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
Exodus|40|5|And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|6|And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
Exodus|40|7|And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
Exodus|40|8|And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
Exodus|40|9|And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.
Exodus|40|10|And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.
Exodus|40|11|And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.
Exodus|40|12|And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.
Exodus|40|13|And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
Exodus|40|14|And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;
Exodus|40|15|and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
Exodus|40|16|
Exodus|40|17|And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
Exodus|40|18|And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.
Exodus|40|19|And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|20|And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
Exodus|40|21|and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|22|And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.

Exodus|40|26|And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:
Exodus|40|27|and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|28|And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|29|And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|30|And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.
Exodus|40|31|And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;
Exodus|40|32|when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Exodus|40|33|
Exodus|40|34|Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|35|And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Exodus|40|36|And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:
Exodus|40|37|but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
Exodus|40|38|
2 Peter|1|1|Saviour Jesus Christ:
2 Peter|1|2|Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
2 Peter|1|3|seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue;
2 Peter|1|4|whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust.
2 Peter|1|5|virtue knowledge;
2 Peter|1|6|patience godliness;
2 Peter|1|7|brotherly kindness love.
2 Peter|1|8|For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|9|For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
2 Peter|1|10|Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble:
2 Peter|1|11|for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2 Peter|1|12|.
2 Peter|1|13|And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
2 Peter|1|14|knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me.
2 Peter|1|15|Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
2 Peter|1|16|For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2 Peter|1|17|For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:
2 Peter|1|18|heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
2 Peter|1|19|more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:
2 Peter|1|20|knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
2 Peter|1|21|
2 Peter|2|1|But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2 Peter|2|2|And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.
2 Peter|2|3|And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
2 Peter|2|4|For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
2 Peter|2|5|and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2 Peter|2|6|and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly;
2 Peter|2|7|and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked
2 Peter|2|8|lawless deeds):
2 Peter|2|9|the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment;
2 Peter|2|10|but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities:
2 Peter|2|11|whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before the Lord.
2 Peter|2|12|But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,
2 Peter|2|13|that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you;
2 Peter|2|14|having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;
2 Peter|2|15|of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;
2 Peter|2|16|but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake with man’s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.
2 Peter|2|17|These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.
2 Peter|2|18|of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error;
2 Peter|2|19|promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.
2 Peter|2|20|For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.
2 Peter|2|21|For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
2 Peter|2|22|
2 Peter|3|1|This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting you in remembrance;
2 Peter|3|2|that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles:
2 Peter|3|3|knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts,
2 Peter|3|4|and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
2 Peter|3|5|For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water, by the word of God;
2 Peter|3|6|by which means the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
2 Peter|3|7|but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
2 Peter|3|8|But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
2 Peter|3|9|The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2 Peter|3|10|But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
2 Peter|3|11|holy living and godliness,
2 Peter|3|12|looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
2 Peter|3|13|But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
2 Peter|3|14|Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things, give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.
2 Peter|3|15|And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;
2 Peter|3|16|also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2 Peter|3|17|beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your own stedfastness.
2 Peter|3|18|
2 Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy|1|2|to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy|1|3|I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day
2 Timothy|1|4|longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
2 Timothy|1|5|having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
2 Timothy|1|6|For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy|1|7|For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
2 Timothy|1|8|Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;
2 Timothy|1|9|who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
2 Timothy|1|10|but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
2 Timothy|1|11|whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
2 Timothy|1|12|For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2 Timothy|1|13|Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|1|14|guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy|1|15|This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy|1|16|The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
2 Timothy|1|17|but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
2 Timothy|1|18|
2 Timothy|2|1|Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|2|2|And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy|2|3|, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|2|4|life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
2 Timothy|2|5|And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.
2 Timothy|2|6|The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
2 Timothy|2|7|Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy|2|8|Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
2 Timothy|2|9|wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
2 Timothy|2|10|Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2 Timothy|2|11|Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
2 Timothy|2|12|if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
2 Timothy|2|13|if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy|2|14|in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
2 Timothy|2|15|Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
2 Timothy|2|16|But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
2 Timothy|2|17|and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;
2 Timothy|2|18|men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
2 Timothy|2|19|Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
2 Timothy|2|20|Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
2 Timothy|2|21|If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.
2 Timothy|2|22|after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy|2|23|But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
2 Timothy|2|24|And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
2 Timothy|2|25|in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,
2 Timothy|2|26|
2 Timothy|3|1|But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
2 Timothy|3|2|For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2 Timothy|3|3|without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
2 Timothy|3|4|traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
2 Timothy|3|5|holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.
2 Timothy|3|6|For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
2 Timothy|3|7|ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy|3|8|And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
2 Timothy|3|9|But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
2 Timothy|3|10|But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
2 Timothy|3|11|persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy|3|12|Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
2 Timothy|3|13|But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
2 Timothy|3|14|But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
2 Timothy|3|15|And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy|3|16|also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.
2 Timothy|3|17|
2 Timothy|4|1|in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
2 Timothy|4|2|preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
2 Timothy|4|3|For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;
2 Timothy|4|4|and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.
2 Timothy|4|5|But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.
2 Timothy|4|6|For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
2 Timothy|4|7|I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
2 Timothy|4|8|henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
2 Timothy|4|9|Give diligence to come shortly unto me:
2 Timothy|4|10|for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy|4|11|Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
2 Timothy|4|12|But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy|4|13|The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
2 Timothy|4|14|Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:
2 Timothy|4|15|of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
2 Timothy|4|16|At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
2 Timothy|4|17|But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2 Timothy|4|18|the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy|4|19|Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy|4|20|Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
2 Timothy|4|21|Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2 Timothy|4|22|
Ephesians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|1|3|in Christ:
Ephesians|1|4|even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:
Ephesians|1|5|having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Ephesians|1|6|to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:
Ephesians|1|7|in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
Ephesians|1|8|which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
Ephesians|1|9|making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
Ephesians|1|10|
Ephesians|1|11|in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;
Ephesians|1|12|to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
Ephesians|1|13|in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,-- in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians|1|14|own possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Ephesians|1|15|toward all the saints,
Ephesians|1|16|in my prayers;
Ephesians|1|17|that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
Ephesians|1|18|having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians|1|19|and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
Ephesians|1|20|,
Ephesians|1|21|far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
Ephesians|1|22|and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,
Ephesians|1|23|
Ephesians|2|1|when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,
Ephesians|2|2|wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;
Ephesians|2|3|among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:--
Ephesians|2|4|but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Ephesians|2|5|even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),
Ephesians|2|6|, in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|7|that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|2|8|the gift of God;
Ephesians|2|9|not of works, that no man should glory.
Ephesians|2|10|For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.
Ephesians|2|11|Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;
Ephesians|2|12|that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians|2|13|But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.
Ephesians|2|14|For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,
Ephesians|2|15|making peace;
Ephesians|2|16|and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
Ephesians|2|17|and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:
Ephesians|2|18|for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians|2|19|So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,
Ephesians|2|20|being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;
Ephesians|2|21|in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;
Ephesians|2|22|
Ephesians|3|1|For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,--
Ephesians|3|2|if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;
Ephesians|3|3|how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,
Ephesians|3|4|whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;
Ephesians|3|5|which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;
Ephesians|3|6|, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,
Ephesians|3|7|whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.
Ephesians|3|8|Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
Ephesians|3|9|and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;
Ephesians|3|10|might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,
Ephesians|3|11|according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians|3|12|in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
Ephesians|3|13|Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
Ephesians|3|14|For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
Ephesians|3|15|from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
Ephesians|3|16|that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;
Ephesians|3|17|that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians|3|18|may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
Ephesians|3|19|and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
Ephesians|3|20|Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Ephesians|3|21|
Ephesians|4|1|I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
Ephesians|4|2|with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Ephesians|4|3|giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians|4|4|one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians|4|5|one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians|4|6|one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
Ephesians|4|7|But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians|4|8|Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.
Ephesians|4|9|(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians|4|10|He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
Ephesians|4|11|apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
Ephesians|4|12|for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:
Ephesians|4|13|till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
Ephesians|4|14|that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;
Ephesians|4|15|Christ;
Ephesians|4|16|measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.
Ephesians|4|17|This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,
Ephesians|4|18|being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;
Ephesians|4|19|who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
Ephesians|4|20|But ye did not so learn Christ;
Ephesians|4|21|if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:
Ephesians|4|22|that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;
Ephesians|4|23|and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
Ephesians|4|24|and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
Ephesians|4|25|Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
Ephesians|4|26|Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
Ephesians|4|27|neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians|4|28|Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.
Ephesians|4|29|Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.
Ephesians|4|30|And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.
Ephesians|4|31|Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:
Ephesians|4|32|
Ephesians|5|1|Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
Ephesians|5|2|and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.
Ephesians|5|3|But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;
Ephesians|5|4|nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians|5|5|For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
Ephesians|5|6|Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians|5|7|Be not ye therefore partakers with them;
Ephesians|5|8|For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light
Ephesians|5|9|(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Ephesians|5|10|proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;
Ephesians|5|11|and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
Ephesians|5|12|for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.
Ephesians|5|13|But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.
Ephesians|5|14|saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.
Ephesians|5|15|Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;
Ephesians|5|16|redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians|5|17|Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians|5|18|And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;
Ephesians|5|19|speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;
Ephesians|5|20|giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;
Ephesians|5|21|subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians|5|22|unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
Ephesians|5|23|himself the saviour of the body.
Ephesians|5|24|to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians|5|25|Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;
Ephesians|5|26|that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,
Ephesians|5|27|, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Ephesians|5|28|Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:
Ephesians|5|29|for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;
Ephesians|5|30|because we are members of his body.
Ephesians|5|31|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.
Ephesians|5|32|This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.
Ephesians|5|33|
Ephesians|6|1|Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Ephesians|6|2|Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise),
Ephesians|6|3|that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
Ephesians|6|4|And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians|6|5|Servants, be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
Ephesians|6|6|not in the way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Ephesians|6|7|with good will doing service, as unto the Lord, and not unto men:
Ephesians|6|8|bond or free.
Ephesians|6|9|And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, and forbear threatening: knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.
Ephesians|6|10|Finally, be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of his might.
Ephesians|6|11|Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Ephesians|6|12|.
Ephesians|6|13|Wherefore take up the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.
Ephesians|6|14|Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
Ephesians|6|15|and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians|6|16|.
Ephesians|6|17|And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians|6|18|with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints,
Ephesians|6|19|And on my behalf, that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians|6|20|for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians|6|21|But that ye also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
Ephesians|6|22|whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians|6|23|Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|6|24|
Galatians|1|1|Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),
Galatians|1|2|and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
Galatians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians|1|4|who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:
Galatians|1|5|the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians|1|6|I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;
Galatians|1|7|only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians|1|8|But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|9|As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.
Galatians|1|10|For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.
Galatians|1|11|For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.
Galatians|1|12|through revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians|1|13|For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:
Galatians|1|14|and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians|1|15|from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,
Galatians|1|16|to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Galatians|1|17|neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.
Galatians|1|18|Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.
Galatians|1|19|But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
Galatians|1|20|Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
Galatians|1|21|Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians|1|22|And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
Galatians|1|23|but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;
Galatians|1|24|
Galatians|2|1|Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
Galatians|2|2|And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.
Galatians|2|3|But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
Galatians|2|4|and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Galatians|2|5|to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Galatians|2|6|But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:
Galatians|2|7|of the circumcision
Galatians|2|8|(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);
Galatians|2|9|and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;
Galatians|2|10|that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.
Galatians|2|11|But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.
Galatians|2|12|For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.
Galatians|2|13|And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians|2|14|all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
Galatians|2|15|We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
Galatians|2|16|yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Galatians|2|17|But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.
Galatians|2|18|For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.
Galatians|2|19|For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.
Galatians|2|20|which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.
Galatians|2|21|
Galatians|3|1|O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?
Galatians|3|2|This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|3|Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?
Galatians|3|4|Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.
Galatians|3|5|by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|6|Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
Galatians|3|7|Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.
Galatians|3|8|In thee shall all the nations be blessed.
Galatians|3|9|So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
Galatians|3|10|For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.
Galatians|3|11|Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;
Galatians|3|12|and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.
Galatians|3|13|Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
Galatians|3|14|that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians|3|15|Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.
Galatians|3|16|Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Galatians|3|17|Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.
Galatians|3|18|For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.
Galatians|3|19|ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
Galatians|3|20|of one; but God is one.
Galatians|3|21|Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.
Galatians|3|22|But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Galatians|3|23|But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Galatians|3|24|unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians|3|25|But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Galatians|3|26|For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|27|For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.
Galatians|3|28|in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|29|
Galatians|4|1|But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;
Galatians|4|2|but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.
Galatians|4|3|So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:
Galatians|4|4|but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
Galatians|4|5|that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Galatians|4|6|And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Galatians|4|7|So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.
Galatians|4|8|Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:
Galatians|4|9|but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?
Galatians|4|10|Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.
Galatians|4|11|I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.
Galatians|4|12|. Ye did me no wrong:
Galatians|4|13|but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:
Galatians|4|14|as Christ Jesus.
Galatians|4|15|Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
Galatians|4|16|So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?
Galatians|4|17|They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.
Galatians|4|18|But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians|4|19|My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you--
Galatians|4|20|but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.
Galatians|4|21|Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Galatians|4|22|For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.
Galatians|4|23|through promise.
Galatians|4|24|are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.
Galatians|4|25|Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.
Galatians|4|26|But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.
Galatians|4|27|
Galatians|4|28|Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
Galatians|4|29|after the Spirit, so also it is now.
Galatians|4|30|Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians|4|31|
Galatians|5|1|For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
Galatians|5|2|Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
Galatians|5|3|Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Galatians|5|4|Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
Galatians|5|5|For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
Galatians|5|6|For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
Galatians|5|7|Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?
Galatians|5|8|not of him that calleth you.
Galatians|5|9|A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Galatians|5|10|I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
Galatians|5|11|But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.
Galatians|5|12|I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
Galatians|5|13|not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.
Galatians|5|14|in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Galatians|5|15|But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Galatians|5|16|But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Galatians|5|17|For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.
Galatians|5|18|But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Galatians|5|19|: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Galatians|5|20|idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,
Galatians|5|21|envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians|5|22|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians|5|23|meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
Galatians|5|24|And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
Galatians|5|25|If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
Galatians|5|26|
Galatians|6|1|Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Galatians|6|2|Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Galatians|6|3|For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Galatians|6|4|But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.
Galatians|6|5|For each man shall bear his own burden.
Galatians|6|6|But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Galatians|6|7|Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Galatians|6|8|For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians|6|9|And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians|6|10|So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.
Galatians|6|11|See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.
Galatians|6|12|As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians|6|13|For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Galatians|6|14|But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Galatians|6|15|For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Galatians|6|16|upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Galatians|6|17|Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.
Galatians|6|18|
1 Corinthians|1|1|an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
1 Corinthians|1|2|and ours:
1 Corinthians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|4|I thank my God always concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;
1 Corinthians|1|5|that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge;
1 Corinthians|1|6|even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
1 Corinthians|1|7|so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
1 Corinthians|1|8|unreproveable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|9|God is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Corinthians|1|10|ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
1 Corinthians|1|11|of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1 Corinthians|1|12|Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos: and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
1 Corinthians|1|13|Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians|1|14|I thank God that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius;
1 Corinthians|1|15|lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name.
1 Corinthians|1|16|And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1 Corinthians|1|17|For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.
1 Corinthians|1|18|For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians|1|19|
1 Corinthians|1|20|Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
1 Corinthians|1|21|For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.
1 Corinthians|1|22|Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:
1 Corinthians|1|23|but we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness;
1 Corinthians|1|24|but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
1 Corinthians|1|25|Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians|1|26|:
1 Corinthians|1|27|but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;
1 Corinthians|1|28|and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are:
1 Corinthians|1|29|that no flesh should glory before God.
1 Corinthians|1|30|But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:
1 Corinthians|1|31|
1 Corinthians|2|1|And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
1 Corinthians|2|2|For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
1 Corinthians|2|3|And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
1 Corinthians|2|4|And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
1 Corinthians|2|5|that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1 Corinthians|2|6|We speak wisdom, however, among them that are fullgrown: yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nought:
1 Corinthians|2|7|that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our glory:
1 Corinthians|2|8|which none of the rulers of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:
1 Corinthians|2|9|
1 Corinthians|2|10|through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
1 Corinthians|2|11|For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians|2|12|But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.
1 Corinthians|2|13|.
1 Corinthians|2|14|Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.
1 Corinthians|2|15|But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.
1 Corinthians|2|16|
1 Corinthians|3|1|And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|2|: nay, not even now are ye able;
1 Corinthians|3|3|for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?
1 Corinthians|3|4|For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?
1 Corinthians|3|5|What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.
1 Corinthians|3|6|I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|7|So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
1 Corinthians|3|8|Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
1 Corinthians|3|9|For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.
1 Corinthians|3|10|According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.
1 Corinthians|3|11|For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|3|12|But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;
1 Corinthians|3|13|each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.
1 Corinthians|3|14|If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.
1 Corinthians|3|15|If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.
1 Corinthians|3|16|the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
1 Corinthians|3|17|If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.
1 Corinthians|3|18|Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
1 Corinthians|3|19|For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:
1 Corinthians|3|20|and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.
1 Corinthians|3|21|Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|22|whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
1 Corinthians|3|23|
1 Corinthians|4|1|Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1 Corinthians|4|2|Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
1 Corinthians|4|3|But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
1 Corinthians|4|4|For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
1 Corinthians|4|5|Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.
1 Corinthians|4|6|beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.
1 Corinthians|4|7|For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?
1 Corinthians|4|8|Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1 Corinthians|4|9|For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.
1 Corinthians|4|10|We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.
1 Corinthians|4|11|Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;
1 Corinthians|4|12|and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;
1 Corinthians|4|13|being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.
1 Corinthians|4|14|I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
1 Corinthians|4|15|not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.
1 Corinthians|4|16|I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
1 Corinthians|4|17|For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.
1 Corinthians|4|18|Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
1 Corinthians|4|19|But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.
1 Corinthians|4|20|For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
1 Corinthians|4|21|
1 Corinthians|5|1|hath his father’s wife.
1 Corinthians|5|2|And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1 Corinthians|5|3|For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,
1 Corinthians|5|4|in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
1 Corinthians|5|5|to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1 Corinthians|5|6|Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians|5|7|Christ:
1 Corinthians|5|8|wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians|5|9|I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;
1 Corinthians|5|10|with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:
1 Corinthians|5|11|but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.
1 Corinthians|5|12|For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians|5|13|
1 Corinthians|6|1|Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
1 Corinthians|6|2|Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1 Corinthians|6|3|Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians|6|4|If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?
1 Corinthians|6|5|among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,
1 Corinthians|6|6|but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?
1 Corinthians|6|7|Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?
1 Corinthians|6|8|brethren.
1 Corinthians|6|9|Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,
1 Corinthians|6|10|nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians|6|11|And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians|6|12|All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1 Corinthians|6|13|Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:
1 Corinthians|6|14|and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.
1 Corinthians|6|15|Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.
1 Corinthians|6|16|Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.
1 Corinthians|6|17|But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians|6|18|Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1 Corinthians|6|19|Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;
1 Corinthians|6|20|
1 Corinthians|7|1|Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians|7|2|But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
1 Corinthians|7|3|Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians|7|4|The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.
1 Corinthians|7|5|Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.
1 Corinthians|7|6|But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
1 Corinthians|7|7|Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1 Corinthians|7|8|But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1 Corinthians|7|9|But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1 Corinthians|7|10|not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband
1 Corinthians|7|11|(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.
1 Corinthians|7|12|But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
1 Corinthians|7|13|And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|14|For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1 Corinthians|7|15|: but God hath called us in peace.
1 Corinthians|7|16|For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1 Corinthians|7|17|Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.
1 Corinthians|7|18|Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians|7|19|Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1 Corinthians|7|20|Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians|7|21|rather.
1 Corinthians|7|22|For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.
1 Corinthians|7|23|Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.
1 Corinthians|7|24|Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.
1 Corinthians|7|25|Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.
1 Corinthians|7|26|that it is good for a man to be as he is.
1 Corinthians|7|27|Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians|7|28|But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.
1 Corinthians|7|29|But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;
1 Corinthians|7|30|and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;
1 Corinthians|7|31|and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
1 Corinthians|7|32|But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
1 Corinthians|7|33|but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
1 Corinthians|7|34|also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
1 Corinthians|7|35|And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1 Corinthians|7|36|, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.
1 Corinthians|7|37|, shall do well.
1 Corinthians|7|38|in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.
1 Corinthians|7|39|A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|7|40|
1 Corinthians|8|1|Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
1 Corinthians|8|2|If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;
1 Corinthians|8|3|but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.
1 Corinthians|8|4|in the world, and that there is no God but one.
1 Corinthians|8|5|For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;
1 Corinthians|8|6|yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.
1 Corinthians|8|7|a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians|8|8|But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
1 Corinthians|8|9|But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.
1 Corinthians|8|10|For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
1 Corinthians|8|11|For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.
1 Corinthians|8|12|And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians|8|13|
1 Corinthians|9|1|Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians|9|2|If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|9|3|My defence to them that examine me is this.
1 Corinthians|9|4|Have we no right to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians|9|5|Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
1 Corinthians|9|6|Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?
1 Corinthians|9|7|What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians|9|8|Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?
1 Corinthians|9|9|For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,
1 Corinthians|9|10|in hope of partaking.
1 Corinthians|9|11|If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?
1 Corinthians|9|12|right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians|9|13|they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|9|14|Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|15|good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.
1 Corinthians|9|16|For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|17|For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.
1 Corinthians|9|18|What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.
1 Corinthians|9|19|I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.
1 Corinthians|9|20|And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
1 Corinthians|9|21|to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.
1 Corinthians|9|22|To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.
1 Corinthians|9|23|And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.
1 Corinthians|9|24|Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.
1 Corinthians|9|25|to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians|9|26|I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:
1 Corinthians|9|27|
1 Corinthians|10|1|For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|2|and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians|10|3|and did all eat the same spiritual food;
1 Corinthians|10|4|and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians|10|5|Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians|10|6|Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1 Corinthians|10|7|Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
1 Corinthians|10|8|Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1 Corinthians|10|9|Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.
1 Corinthians|10|10|Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
1 Corinthians|10|11|Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
1 Corinthians|10|12|Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians|10|13|There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.
1 Corinthians|10|14|Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians|10|15|I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians|10|16|The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians|10|17|seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.
1 Corinthians|10|18|Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?
1 Corinthians|10|19|What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
1 Corinthians|10|20|, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.
1 Corinthians|10|21|Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.
1 Corinthians|10|22|Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians|10|23|All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.
1 Corinthians|10|24|.
1 Corinthians|10|25|Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake,
1 Corinthians|10|26|for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
1 Corinthians|10|27|, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
1 Corinthians|10|28|But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:
1 Corinthians|10|29|conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?
1 Corinthians|10|30|If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians|10|31|Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
1 Corinthians|10|32|Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:
1 Corinthians|10|33|
1 Corinthians|11|1|Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1 Corinthians|11|2|Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
1 Corinthians|11|3|But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
1 Corinthians|11|4|Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
1 Corinthians|11|5|But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians|11|6|For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
1 Corinthians|11|7|For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1 Corinthians|11|8|For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:
1 Corinthians|11|9|for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:
1 Corinthians|11|10|authority on her head, because of the angels.
1 Corinthians|11|11|Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|12|For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.
1 Corinthians|11|13|Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?
1 Corinthians|11|14|Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
1 Corinthians|11|15|But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
1 Corinthians|11|16|But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1 Corinthians|11|17|But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.
1 Corinthians|11|18|For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.
1 Corinthians|11|19|For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
1 Corinthians|11|20|When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:
1 Corinthians|11|21|his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1 Corinthians|11|22|What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.
1 Corinthians|11|23|For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;
1 Corinthians|11|24|and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|25|, in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians|11|26|For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.
1 Corinthians|11|27|Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|11|28|But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
1 Corinthians|11|29|For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.
1 Corinthians|11|30|For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
1 Corinthians|11|31|But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.
1 Corinthians|11|32|But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
1 Corinthians|11|33|Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.
1 Corinthians|11|34|
1 Corinthians|12|1|, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
1 Corinthians|12|2|led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might led.
1 Corinthians|12|3|Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|4|Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|5|And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
1 Corinthians|12|6|And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.
1 Corinthians|12|7|But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
1 Corinthians|12|8|For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:
1 Corinthians|12|9|to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;
1 Corinthians|12|10|kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:
1 Corinthians|12|11|but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
1 Corinthians|12|12|For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.
1 Corinthians|12|13|For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
1 Corinthians|12|14|For the body is not one member, but many.
1 Corinthians|12|15|If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|16|And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
1 Corinthians|12|17|If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
1 Corinthians|12|18|But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
1 Corinthians|12|19|And if they were all one member, where were the body?
1 Corinthians|12|20|But now they are many members, but one body.
1 Corinthians|12|21|And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians|12|22|Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:
1 Corinthians|12|23|have more abundant comeliness;
1 Corinthians|12|24|which lacked;
1 Corinthians|12|25|the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians|12|26|member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
1 Corinthians|12|27|Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.
1 Corinthians|12|28|kinds of tongues.
1 Corinthians|12|29|miracles?
1 Corinthians|12|30|have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians|12|31|
1 Corinthians|13|1|If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.
1 Corinthians|13|2|prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|3|, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.
1 Corinthians|13|4|is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1 Corinthians|13|5|doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;
1 Corinthians|13|6|rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;
1 Corinthians|13|7|beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1 Corinthians|13|8|knowledge, it shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|9|For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
1 Corinthians|13|10|but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.
1 Corinthians|13|11|When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.
1 Corinthians|13|12|For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.
1 Corinthians|13|13|
1 Corinthians|14|1|, but rather that ye may prophesy.
1 Corinthians|14|2|For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1 Corinthians|14|3|But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
1 Corinthians|14|4|He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians|14|5|Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|6|But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?
1 Corinthians|14|7|Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1 Corinthians|14|8|For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
1 Corinthians|14|9|So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.
1 Corinthians|14|10|is without signification.
1 Corinthians|14|11|If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.
1 Corinthians|14|12|, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.
1 Corinthians|14|13|Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians|14|14|For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians|14|15|What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1 Corinthians|14|16|Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?
1 Corinthians|14|17|For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1 Corinthians|14|18|I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:
1 Corinthians|14|19|howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
1 Corinthians|14|20|Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.
1 Corinthians|14|21|In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|22|, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
1 Corinthians|14|23|If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?
1 Corinthians|14|24|But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;
1 Corinthians|14|25|the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.
1 Corinthians|14|26|What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
1 Corinthians|14|27|in turn; and let one interpret:
1 Corinthians|14|28|but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
1 Corinthians|14|29|two or three, and let the others discern.
1 Corinthians|14|30|But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.
1 Corinthians|14|31|For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;
1 Corinthians|14|32|and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
1 Corinthians|14|33|of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
1 Corinthians|14|34|let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.
1 Corinthians|14|35|And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.
1 Corinthians|14|36|What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?
1 Corinthians|14|37|If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
1 Corinthians|14|38|But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1 Corinthians|14|39|Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
1 Corinthians|14|40|
1 Corinthians|15|1|Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,
1 Corinthians|15|2|by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.
1 Corinthians|15|3|For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|4|and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians|15|5|and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;
1 Corinthians|15|6|then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;
1 Corinthians|15|7|then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;
1 Corinthians|15|8|untimely born, he appeared to me also.
1 Corinthians|15|9|For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
1 Corinthians|15|10|But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1 Corinthians|15|11|I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1 Corinthians|15|12|Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians|15|13|But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|14|and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.
1 Corinthians|15|15|Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.
1 Corinthians|15|16|For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:
1 Corinthians|15|17|and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
1 Corinthians|15|18|Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
1 Corinthians|15|19|If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
1 Corinthians|15|20|But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.
1 Corinthians|15|21|also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians|15|22|For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians|15|23|But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.
1 Corinthians|15|24|the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
1 Corinthians|15|25|For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians|15|26|The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.
1 Corinthians|15|27|For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.
1 Corinthians|15|28|And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians|15|29|Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?
1 Corinthians|15|30|Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians|15|31|I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
1 Corinthians|15|32|If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
1 Corinthians|15|33|Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
1 Corinthians|15|34|to move you to shame.
1 Corinthians|15|35|But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?
1 Corinthians|15|36|Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:
1 Corinthians|15|37|and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;
1 Corinthians|15|38|but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
1 Corinthians|15|39|of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
1 Corinthians|15|40|of the terrestrial is another.
1 Corinthians|15|41|There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
1 Corinthians|15|42|So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians|15|43|it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians|15|44|.
1 Corinthians|15|45|a life-giving spirit.
1 Corinthians|15|46|Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians|15|47|The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.
1 Corinthians|15|48|As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|49|And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians|15|50|Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians|15|51|Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians|15|52|in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians|15|53|For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1 Corinthians|15|54|But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians|15|55|O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?
1 Corinthians|15|56|The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:
1 Corinthians|15|57|but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians|15|58|
1 Corinthians|16|1|Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
1 Corinthians|16|2|Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
1 Corinthians|16|3|And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:
1 Corinthians|16|4|and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.
1 Corinthians|16|5|But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;
1 Corinthians|16|6|but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.
1 Corinthians|16|7|For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1 Corinthians|16|8|But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;
1 Corinthians|16|9|for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1 Corinthians|16|10|Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:
1 Corinthians|16|11|let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.
1 Corinthians|16|12|will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.
1 Corinthians|16|13|Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1 Corinthians|16|14|Let all that ye do be done in love.
1 Corinthians|16|15|Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),
1 Corinthians|16|16|that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.
1 Corinthians|16|17|And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.
1 Corinthians|16|18|For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.
1 Corinthians|16|19|The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1 Corinthians|16|20|All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.
1 Corinthians|16|21|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians|16|22|If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.
1 Corinthians|16|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1 Corinthians|16|24|
Acts|1|1|The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
Acts|1|2|until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
Acts|1|3|To whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God:
Acts|1|4|, ye heard from me:
Acts|1|5|For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
Acts|1|6|They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
Acts|1|7|And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within His own authority.
Acts|1|8|But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Acts|1|9|And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
Acts|1|10|And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
Acts|1|11|who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this Jesus, who was received up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
Acts|1|12|Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey off.
Acts|1|13|of James.
Acts|1|14|These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
Acts|1|15|together, about a hundred and twenty),
Acts|1|16|Brethren, it was needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spake before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
Acts|1|17|For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.
Acts|1|18|(Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
Acts|1|19|And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)
Acts|1|20|
Acts|1|21|Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
Acts|1|22|beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.
Acts|1|23|And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Acts|1|24|And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen,
Acts|1|25|to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.
Acts|1|26|
Acts|2|1|And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place.
Acts|2|2|And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Acts|2|3|And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them.
Acts|2|4|And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Acts|2|5|Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
Acts|2|6|And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language.
Acts|2|7|And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
Acts|2|8|And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
Acts|2|9|Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
Acts|2|10|in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts|2|11|Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.
Acts|2|12|And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
Acts|2|13|But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.
Acts|2|14|, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words.
Acts|2|15|the third hour of the day.
Acts|2|16|
Acts|2|17|
Acts|2|18|
Acts|2|19|
Acts|2|20|
Acts|2|21|
Acts|2|22|Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God unto you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even as ye yourselves know;
Acts|2|23|him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay:
Acts|2|24|whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
Acts|2|25|
Acts|2|26|
Acts|2|27|
Acts|2|28|
Acts|2|29|Brethren, I may say unto you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us unto this day.
Acts|2|30|upon his throne;
Acts|2|31|spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
Acts|2|32|This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.
Acts|2|33|Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.
Acts|2|34|
Acts|2|35|
Acts|2|36|Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
Acts|2|37|they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
Acts|2|38|unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|2|39|as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.
Acts|2|40|And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
Acts|2|41|in that day about three thousand souls.
Acts|2|42|And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
Acts|2|43|And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
Acts|2|44|And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
Acts|2|45|and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.
Acts|2|46|And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
Acts|2|47|
Acts|3|1|.
Acts|3|2|And a certain man that was lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
Acts|3|3|who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms.
Acts|3|4|And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, Look on us.
Acts|3|5|And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts|3|6|But Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but what I have, that give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.
Acts|3|7|And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength.
Acts|3|8|And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
Acts|3|9|And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
Acts|3|10|and they took knowledge of him, that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
Acts|3|11|And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
Acts|3|12|And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this man? or why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?
Acts|3|13|The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.
Acts|3|14|But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you,
Acts|3|15|and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
Acts|3|16|And by faith in his name hath his name made this man strong, whom ye behold and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
Acts|3|17|And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
Acts|3|18|But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
Acts|3|19|Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;
Acts|3|20|Jesus:
Acts|3|21|whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, whereof God spake by the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old.
Acts|3|22|Moses indeed said, A prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me. To him shall ye hearken in all things whatsoever he shall speak unto you.
Acts|3|23|And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Acts|3|24|Yea and all the prophets from Samuel and them that followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
Acts|3|25|Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Acts|3|26|
Acts|4|1|And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
Acts|4|2|being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts|4|3|And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.
Acts|4|4|But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
Acts|4|5|And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;
Acts|4|6|, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
Acts|4|7|And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?
Acts|4|8|Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,
Acts|4|9|if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;
Acts|4|10|in him doth this man stand here before you whole.
Acts|4|11|He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.
Acts|4|12|And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.
Acts|4|13|Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
Acts|4|14|And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
Acts|4|15|But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
Acts|4|16|saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
Acts|4|17|But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
Acts|4|18|And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
Acts|4|19|But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:
Acts|4|20|for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.
Acts|4|21|And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.
Acts|4|22|For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.
Acts|4|23|And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.
Acts|4|24|And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:
Acts|4|25|
Acts|4|26|
Acts|4|27|for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,
Acts|4|28|to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.
Acts|4|29|And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,
Acts|4|30|while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.
Acts|4|31|And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
Acts|4|32|said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
Acts|4|33|And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
Acts|4|34|For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
Acts|4|35|and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.
Acts|4|36|And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,
Acts|4|37|
Acts|5|1|But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
Acts|5|2|of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
Acts|5|3|of the price of the land?
Acts|5|4|While it remained, did it not remain thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? How is it that thou hast conceived this thing in thy heart? thou has not lied unto men, but unto God.
Acts|5|5|And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all that heard it.
Acts|5|6|And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.
Acts|5|7|And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
Acts|5|8|And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much. And she said, Yea, for so much.
Acts|5|9|unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
Acts|5|10|And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.
Acts|5|11|And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.
Acts|5|12|And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
Acts|5|13|But of the rest durst no man join himself to them: howbeit the people magnified them;
Acts|5|14|and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;
Acts|5|15|insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.
Acts|5|16|And there also came together the multitudes from the cities round about Jerusalem, bring sick folk, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
Acts|5|17|But the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
Acts|5|18|and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.
Acts|5|19|But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,
Acts|5|20|Go ye, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.
Acts|5|21|, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.
Acts|5|22|But the officers that came found them not in the prison; and they returned, and told,
Acts|5|23|saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
Acts|5|24|Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow.
Acts|5|25|And there came one and told them, Behold, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.
Acts|5|26|without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
Acts|5|27|And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
Acts|5|28|saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name: and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
Acts|5|29|But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.
Acts|5|30|The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.
Acts|5|31|a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
Acts|5|32|the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
Acts|5|33|But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and minded to slay them.
Acts|5|34|But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.
Acts|5|35|And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.
Acts|5|36|For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.
Acts|5|37|people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.
Acts|5|38|And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:
Acts|5|39|but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.
Acts|5|40|And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
Acts|5|41|They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.
Acts|5|42|
Acts|6|1|Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Acts|6|2|And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables.
Acts|6|3|Look ye out therefore, brethren, from among you seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
Acts|6|4|But we will continue stedfastly in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.
Acts|6|5|And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch;
Acts|6|6|whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands upon them.
Acts|6|7|And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
Acts|6|8|And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.
Acts|6|9|of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
Acts|6|10|And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.
Acts|6|11|God.
Acts|6|12|And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the council,
Acts|6|13|and set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place, and the law:
Acts|6|14|for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered unto us.
Acts|6|15|
Acts|7|1|And the high priest said, Are these things so?
Acts|7|2|And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken: The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
Acts|7|3|and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
Acts|7|4|removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell:
Acts|7|5|he had no child.
Acts|7|6|And God spake on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.
Acts|7|7|And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
Acts|7|8|Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
Acts|7|9|And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,
Acts|7|10|and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Acts|7|11|Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
Acts|7|12|But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.
Acts|7|13|And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.
Acts|7|14|And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
Acts|7|15|And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;
Acts|7|16|and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts|7|17|But as the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Acts|7|18|till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
Acts|7|19|The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.
Acts|7|20|At which season Moses was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house.
Acts|7|21|and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
Acts|7|22|And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
Acts|7|23|But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
Acts|7|24|suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian:
Acts|7|25|and he supposed that his brethren understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.
Acts|7|26|And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
Acts|7|27|But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts|7|28|Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
Acts|7|29|And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
Acts|7|30|And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
Acts|7|31|And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord,
Acts|7|32|I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
Acts|7|33|And the Lord said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Acts|7|34|I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
Acts|7|35|both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
Acts|7|36|This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
Acts|7|37|This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.
Acts|7|38|This is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us:
Acts|7|39|to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt,
Acts|7|40|saying unto Aaron, Make us gods that shall go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
Acts|7|41|And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
Acts|7|42|
Acts|7|43|
Acts|7|44|Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.
Acts|7|45|Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
Acts|7|46|who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts|7|47|But Solomon built him a house.
Acts|7|48|
Acts|7|49|
Acts|7|50|
Acts|7|51|Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye.
Acts|7|52|Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers;
Acts|7|53|ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
Acts|7|54|Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
Acts|7|55|But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
Acts|7|56|and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.
Acts|7|57|But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord;
Acts|7|58|and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
Acts|7|59|, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
Acts|7|60|
Acts|8|1|And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts|8|2|And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
Acts|8|3|But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.
Acts|8|4|They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.
Acts|8|5|And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.
Acts|8|6|And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.
Acts|8|7|many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.
Acts|8|8|And there was much joy in that city.
Acts|8|9|But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
Acts|8|10|to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.
Acts|8|11|And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
Acts|8|12|But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Acts|8|13|And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.
Acts|8|14|Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
Acts|8|15|who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:
Acts|8|16|for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|8|17|Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|18|Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
Acts|8|19|saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|20|But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.
Acts|8|21|Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.
Acts|8|22|Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.
Acts|8|23|For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.
Acts|8|24|And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.
Acts|8|25|They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts|8|26|But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.
Acts|8|27|And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;
Acts|8|28|and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
Acts|8|29|And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
Acts|8|30|And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
Acts|8|31|And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts|8|32|
Acts|8|33|
Acts|8|34|And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?
Acts|8|35|And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.
Acts|8|36|water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
Acts|8|37|
Acts|8|38|And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
Acts|8|39|And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
Acts|8|40|
Acts|9|1|But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
Acts|9|2|and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts|9|3|And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven:
Acts|9|4|and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts|9|5|, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:
Acts|9|6|but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
Acts|9|7|And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.
Acts|9|8|And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
Acts|9|9|And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
Acts|9|10|, Lord.
Acts|9|11|unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth;
Acts|9|12|and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.
Acts|9|13|But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem:
Acts|9|14|and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
Acts|9|15|But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel:
Acts|9|16|for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
Acts|9|17|Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Acts|9|18|And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;
Acts|9|19|and he took food and was strengthened. And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.
Acts|9|20|And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
Acts|9|21|And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.
Acts|9|22|But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
Acts|9|23|And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:
Acts|9|24|but their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him:
Acts|9|25|but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
Acts|9|26|And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
Acts|9|27|But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts|9|28|And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,
Acts|9|29|preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spake and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.
Acts|9|30|And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Acts|9|31|So the church throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.
Acts|9|32|And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
Acts|9|33|And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.
Acts|9|34|And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise and make thy bed. And straightway he arose.
Acts|9|35|And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
Acts|9|36|Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
Acts|9|37|And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
Acts|9|38|And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.
Acts|9|39|And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
Acts|9|40|But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Acts|9|41|And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
Acts|9|42|And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.
Acts|9|43|
Acts|10|1|,
Acts|10|2|a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always.
Acts|10|3|He saw in a vision openly, as it were about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
Acts|10|4|And he, fastening his eyes upon him, and being affrighted, said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.
Acts|10|5|And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
Acts|10|6|he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.
Acts|10|7|And when the angel that spake unto him was departed, he called two of his household-servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
Acts|10|8|and having rehearsed all things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts|10|9|Now on the morrow, as they were on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:
Acts|10|10|and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;
Acts|10|11|and he beholdeth the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth:
Acts|10|12|wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.
Acts|10|13|And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
Acts|10|14|But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.
Acts|10|15|unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.
Acts|10|16|And this was done thrice: and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven.
Acts|10|17|Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood before the gate,
Acts|10|18|and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodging there.
Acts|10|19|And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
Acts|10|20|But arise, and get thee down, and go with them, nothing doubting: for I have sent them.
Acts|10|21|And Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
Acts|10|22|by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words from thee.
Acts|10|23|So he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts|10|24|And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.
Acts|10|25|And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
Acts|10|26|But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
Acts|10|27|And as he talked with him, he went in, and findeth many come together:
Acts|10|28|unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean:
Acts|10|29|wherefore also I came without gainsaying, when I was sent for. I ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me.
Acts|10|30|And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,
Acts|10|31|and saith, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
Acts|10|32|Send therefore to Joppa, and call unto thee Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.
Acts|10|33|Forthwith therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded thee of the Lord.
Acts|10|34|And Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
Acts|10|35|but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.
Acts|10|36|The word which he sent unto the children of Israel, preaching good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all.) --
Acts|10|37|that saying ye yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
Acts|10|38|Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
Acts|10|39|And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.
Acts|10|40|Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,
Acts|10|41|to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
Acts|10|42|the Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts|10|43|To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.
Acts|10|44|While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.
Acts|10|45|And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|10|46|For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
Acts|10|47|Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
Acts|10|48|
Acts|11|1|Now the apostles and the brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts|11|2|And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
Acts|11|3|saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
Acts|11|4|unto them in order, saying,
Acts|11|5|I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even unto me:
Acts|11|6|upon which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw the fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the heaven.
Acts|11|7|And I heard also a voice saying unto me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
Acts|11|8|But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.
Acts|11|9|But a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God hath cleansed, make not thou common.
Acts|11|10|And this was done thrice: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
Acts|11|11|And behold, forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea unto me.
Acts|11|12|And the Spirit bade me go with them, making no distinction. And these six brethren also accompanied me; and we entered into the man’s house:
Acts|11|13|and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Acts|11|14|who shall speak unto thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.
Acts|11|15|And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
Acts|11|16|And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Acts|11|17|also unto us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?
Acts|11|18|And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life.
Acts|11|19|They therefore that were scattered abroad upon the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none save only to Jews.
Acts|11|20|But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
Acts|11|21|And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned unto the Lord.
Acts|11|22|And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas as far as Antioch:
Acts|11|23|who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord:
Acts|11|24|for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
Acts|11|25|And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;
Acts|11|26|and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught much people, and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
Acts|11|27|Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
Acts|11|28|And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.
Acts|11|29|And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea:
Acts|11|30|
Acts|12|1|Now about that time Herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church.
Acts|12|2|And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
Acts|12|3|were the days of unleavened bread.
Acts|12|4|And when he had taken him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
Acts|12|5|Peter therefore was kept in the prison: but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto God for him.
Acts|12|6|And when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and guards before the door kept the prison.
Acts|12|7|And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell: and he smote Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
Acts|12|8|And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
Acts|12|9|And he went out, and followed; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.
Acts|12|10|And when they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and straightway the angel departed from him.
Acts|12|11|And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a truth, that the Lord hath sent forth his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
Acts|12|12|, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together and were praying.
Acts|12|13|And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda.
Acts|12|14|And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but ran in, and told that Peter stood before the gate.
Acts|12|15|And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel.
Acts|12|16|But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.
Acts|12|17|But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him forth out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went to another place.
Acts|12|18|Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
Acts|12|19|And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and tarried there.
Acts|12|20|Now he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: and they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king’s country.
Acts|12|21|And upon a set day Herod arrayed himself in royal apparel, and sat on the throne, and made an oration unto them.
Acts|12|22|, The voice of a god, and not of a man.
Acts|12|23|And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
Acts|12|24|But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Acts|12|25|
Acts|13|1|, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
Acts|13|2|And as they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
Acts|13|3|Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
Acts|13|4|So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
Acts|13|5|And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.
Acts|13|6|And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus;
Acts|13|7|who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|8|But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
Acts|13|9|Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,
Acts|13|10|and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
Acts|13|11|And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Acts|13|12|Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
Acts|13|13|Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts|13|14|But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
Acts|13|15|And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
Acts|13|16|And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, hearken:
Acts|13|17|The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.
Acts|13|18|And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.
Acts|13|19|their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:
Acts|13|20|judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts|13|21|And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
Acts|13|22|And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who shall do all My will.
Acts|13|23|Of this man’s seed hath God according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus;
Acts|13|24|when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts|13|25|. But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
Acts|13|26|Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.
Acts|13|27|.
Acts|13|28|, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.
Acts|13|29|And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
Acts|13|30|But God raised him from the dead:
Acts|13|31|and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.
Acts|13|32|And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,
Acts|13|33|that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
Acts|13|34|of David.
Acts|13|35|, Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption.
Acts|13|36|For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
Acts|13|37|but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.
Acts|13|38|Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:
Acts|13|39|and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Acts|13|40|
Acts|13|41|
Acts|13|42|And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.
Acts|13|43|Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
Acts|13|44|And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|45|But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
Acts|13|46|And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
Acts|13|47|
Acts|13|48|And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
Acts|13|49|And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.
Acts|13|50|But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.
Acts|13|51|But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
Acts|13|52|
Acts|14|1|And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
Acts|14|2|But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.
Acts|14|3|speaking boldly in the Lord, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
Acts|14|4|But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
Acts|14|5|And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them,
Acts|14|6|they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about:
Acts|14|7|and there they preached the gospel.
Acts|14|8|And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.
Acts|14|9|The same heard Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,
Acts|14|10|said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.
Acts|14|11|And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
Acts|14|12|And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
Acts|14|13|was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.
Acts|14|14|But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out
Acts|14|15|and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:
Acts|14|16|who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways.
Acts|14|17|And yet He left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
Acts|14|18|And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.
Acts|14|19|But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
Acts|14|20|But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts|14|21|And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
Acts|14|22|confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
Acts|14|23|And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
Acts|14|24|And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
Acts|14|25|And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;
Acts|14|26|and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
Acts|14|27|And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles.
Acts|14|28|
Acts|15|1|, Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
Acts|15|2|appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
Acts|15|3|They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
Acts|15|4|And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.
Acts|15|5|But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.
Acts|15|6|And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.
Acts|15|7|And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
Acts|15|8|And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;
Acts|15|9|and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
Acts|15|10|Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Acts|15|11|But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.
Acts|15|12|And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.
Acts|15|13|And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:
Acts|15|14|Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
Acts|15|15|
Acts|15|16|
Acts|15|17|
Acts|15|18|
Acts|15|19|Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;
Acts|15|20|but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
Acts|15|21|For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.
Acts|15|22|, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
Acts|15|23|by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
Acts|15|24|Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;
Acts|15|25|it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts|15|26|men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|15|27|We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.
Acts|15|28|For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
Acts|15|29|that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.
Acts|15|30|So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.
Acts|15|31|And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.
Acts|15|32|And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
Acts|15|33|, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.
Acts|15|34|
Acts|15|35|But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
Acts|15|36|how they fare.
Acts|15|37|And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.
Acts|15|38|But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
Acts|15|39|And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;
Acts|15|40|but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.
Acts|15|41|
Acts|16|1|And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|2|The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
Acts|16|3|Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|4|And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.
Acts|16|5|So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
Acts|16|6|And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;
Acts|16|7|and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;
Acts|16|8|and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts|16|9|And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
Acts|16|10|And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Acts|16|11|Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
Acts|16|12|colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.
Acts|16|13|And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.
Acts|16|14|And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts|16|15|. And she constrained us.
Acts|16|16|And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
Acts|16|17|The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.
Acts|16|18|And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
Acts|16|19|But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,
Acts|16|20|and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
Acts|16|21|and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.
Acts|16|22|And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.
Acts|16|23|And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Acts|16|24|who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
Acts|16|25|But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
Acts|16|26|and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
Acts|16|27|And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts|16|28|But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
Acts|16|29|And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,
Acts|16|30|and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts|16|31|And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
Acts|16|32|And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.
Acts|16|33|And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.
Acts|16|34|And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.
Acts|16|35|But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
Acts|16|36|, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.
Acts|16|37|But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.
Acts|16|38|And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;
Acts|16|39|and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.
Acts|16|40|
Acts|17|1|Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
Acts|17|2|and Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts|17|3|I proclaim unto you, is the Christ.
Acts|17|4|And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
Acts|17|5|But the Jews, being moved with jealousy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathering a crowd, set the city on an uproar; and assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them forth to the people.
Acts|17|6|And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
Acts|17|7|Jesus.
Acts|17|8|And they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
Acts|17|9|And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Acts|17|10|And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Beroea: who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts|17|11|Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
Acts|17|12|Many of them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate, and of men, not a few.
Acts|17|13|But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed of Paul at Beroea also, they came thither likewise, stirring up and troubling the multitudes.
Acts|17|14|And then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul to go as far as to the sea: and Silas and Timothy abode there still.
Acts|17|15|But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
Acts|17|16|Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols.
Acts|17|17|So he reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with them that met him.
Acts|17|18|And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What would this babbler say? others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
Acts|17|19|And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?
Acts|17|20|For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
Acts|17|21|(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
Acts|17|22|And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.
Acts|17|23|For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.
Acts|17|24|The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
Acts|17|25|neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
Acts|17|26|appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;
Acts|17|27|that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:
Acts|17|28|for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
Acts|17|29|Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.
Acts|17|30|The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:
Acts|17|31|inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
Acts|17|32|Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.
Acts|17|33|Thus Paul went out from among them.
Acts|17|34|
Acts|18|1|After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
Acts|18|2|And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome: and he came unto them;
Acts|18|3|and because he was of the same trade, he abode with them, and they wrought, for by their trade they were tentmakers.
Acts|18|4|And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
Acts|18|5|But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|18|6|upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
Acts|18|7|And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
Acts|18|8|And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.
Acts|18|9|And the Lord said unto Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy peace:
Acts|18|10|for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to harm thee: for I have much people in this city.
Acts|18|11|a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Acts|18|12|But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment-seat,
Acts|18|13|saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts|18|14|But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked villany, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:
Acts|18|15|but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; I am not minded to be a judge of these matters.
Acts|18|16|And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
Acts|18|17|And they all laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
Acts|18|18|And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.
Acts|18|19|And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts|18|20|And when they asked him to abide a longer time, he consented not;
Acts|18|21|but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again unto you if God will, he set sail from Ephesus.
Acts|18|22|And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church, and went down to Antioch.
Acts|18|23|, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.
Acts|18|24|Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the scriptures.
Acts|18|25|This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:
Acts|18|26|and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.
Acts|18|27|And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;
Acts|18|28|
Acts|19|1|And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples:
Acts|19|2|.
Acts|19|3|And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.
Acts|19|4|And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
Acts|19|5|And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|19|6|And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
Acts|19|7|And they were in all about twelve men.
Acts|19|8|the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts|19|9|But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
Acts|19|10|And this continued for the space of two years; so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts|19|11|And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
Acts|19|12|insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.
Acts|19|13|But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took upon them to name over them that had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
Acts|19|14|And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.
Acts|19|15|And the evil spirit answered and said unto them, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?
Acts|19|16|And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts|19|17|And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts|19|18|Many also of them that had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
Acts|19|19|And not a few of them that practised magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts|19|20|So mightily grew the word of the Lord and prevailed.
Acts|19|21|Now after these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Acts|19|22|And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
Acts|19|23|And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
Acts|19|24|For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;
Acts|19|25|whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.
Acts|19|26|And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:
Acts|19|27|and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
Acts|19|28|And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.
Acts|19|29|And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel.
Acts|19|30|And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
Acts|19|31|And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.
Acts|19|32|Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
Acts|19|33|And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.
Acts|19|34|But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts|19|35|which fell down from Jupiter?
Acts|19|36|Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
Acts|19|37|these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts|19|38|If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.
Acts|19|39|But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
Acts|19|40|: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.
Acts|19|41|
Acts|20|1|And after the uproar ceased, Paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
Acts|20|2|And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece.
Acts|20|3|and a plot was laid against him by Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedonia.
Acts|20|4|of Pyrrhus; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts|20|5|But these had gone before, and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts|20|6|And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we tarried seven days.
Acts|20|7|And upon the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and prolonged his speech until midnight.
Acts|20|8|And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
Acts|20|9|And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
Acts|20|10|And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Make ye no ado; for his life is in him.
Acts|20|11|And when he was gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
Acts|20|12|And they brought the lad alive, and were not a little comforted.
Acts|20|13|But we going before to the ship set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.
Acts|20|14|And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
Acts|20|15|And sailing from thence, we came the following day over against Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.
Acts|20|16|For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
Acts|20|17|And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.
Acts|20|18|And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,
Acts|20|19|serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;
Acts|20|20|how I shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly, and from house to house,
Acts|20|21|testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|20|22|And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:
Acts|20|23|save that the Holy Spirit testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
Acts|20|24|But I hold not my life of any account as dear unto myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts|20|25|And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
Acts|20|26|Wherefore I testify unto you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.
Acts|20|27|For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.
Acts|20|28|Take heed unto yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit hath made you bishops, to feed the church of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood.
Acts|20|29|I know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock;
Acts|20|30|and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts|20|31|Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.
Acts|20|32|the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
Acts|20|33|I coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
Acts|20|34|Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
Acts|20|35|In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Acts|20|36|And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
Acts|20|37|And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,
Acts|20|38|
Acts|21|1|And when it came to pass that were parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the next day unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
Acts|21|2|and having found a ship crossing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
Acts|21|3|And when we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
Acts|21|4|And having found the disciples, we tarried there seven days: and these said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts|21|5|And when it came to pass that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were out of the city: and kneeling down on the beach, we prayed, and bade each other farewell;
Acts|21|6|and we went on board the ship, but they returned home again.
Acts|21|7|And when we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
Acts|21|8|And on the morrow we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.
Acts|21|9|Now this man had four virgin daughters, who prophesied.
Acts|21|10|And as we tarried there some days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
Acts|21|11|And coming to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts|21|12|And when we heard these things, both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|13|Then Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|21|14|And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Acts|21|15|And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|16|one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
Acts|21|17|And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
Acts|21|18|And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
Acts|21|19|And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry.
Acts|21|20|And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of them that have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:
Acts|21|21|and they have been informed concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
Acts|21|22|What is it therefore? They will certainly hear that thou art come.
Acts|21|23|Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men that have a vow on them;
Acts|21|24|these take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have been informed concerning thee; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law.
Acts|21|25|But as touching the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.
Acts|21|26|Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them went into the temple, declaring the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
Acts|21|27|And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,
Acts|21|28|crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.
Acts|21|29|For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
Acts|21|30|And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.
Acts|21|31|And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
Acts|21|32|And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.
Acts|21|33|Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.
Acts|21|34|And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.
Acts|21|35|And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;
Acts|21|36|for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.
Acts|21|37|And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?
Acts|21|38|Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?
Acts|21|39|But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.
Acts|21|40|
Acts|22|1|Brethren and fathers, hear ye the defence which I now make unto you.
Acts|22|2|And when they heard that he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet: and he saith,
Acts|22|3|I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as ye all are this day:
Acts|22|4|and I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
Acts|22|5|As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and journeyed to Damascus to bring them also that were there unto Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.
Acts|22|6|And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
Acts|22|7|And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts|22|8|And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Acts|22|9|And they that were with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
Acts|22|10|And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
Acts|22|11|And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me I came into Damascus.
Acts|22|12|And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,
Acts|22|13|came unto me, and standing by me said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.
Acts|22|14|And he said, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.
Acts|22|15|For thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
Acts|22|16|And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.
Acts|22|17|And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,
Acts|22|18|and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me.
Acts|22|19|And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
Acts|22|20|and when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and keeping the garments of them that slew him.
Acts|22|21|And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles.
Acts|22|22|And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
Acts|22|23|And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,
Acts|22|24|the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.
Acts|22|25|And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
Acts|22|26|And when the centurion heard it, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, What art thou about to do? for this man is a Roman.
Acts|22|27|And the chief captain came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea.
Acts|22|28|born.
Acts|22|29|They then that were about to examine him straightway departed from him: and the chief captain also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
Acts|22|30|
Acts|23|1|And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.
Acts|23|2|And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
Acts|23|3|Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
Acts|23|4|And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
Acts|23|5|And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.
Acts|23|6|But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
Acts|23|7|And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.
Acts|23|8|For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
Acts|23|9|And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?
Acts|23|10|And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.
Acts|23|11|And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
Acts|23|12|And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
Acts|23|13|And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.
Acts|23|14|And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.
Acts|23|15|Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.
Acts|23|16|But Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.
Acts|23|17|And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.
Acts|23|18|So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.
Acts|23|19|And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?
Acts|23|20|And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.
Acts|23|21|Do not thou therefore yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink till they have slain him: and now are they ready, looking for the promise from thee.
Acts|23|22|So the chief captain let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me.
Acts|23|23|And he called unto him two of the centurions, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:
Acts|23|24|provide beasts, that they might set Paul thereon, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
Acts|23|25|And he wrote a letter after this form:
Acts|23|26|Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix, greeting.
Acts|23|27|This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
Acts|23|28|And desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him down unto their council:
Acts|23|29|whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts|23|30|And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to thee forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak against him before thee.
Acts|23|31|So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts|23|32|But on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:
Acts|23|33|and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
Acts|23|34|And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,
Acts|23|35|
Acts|24|1|an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
Acts|24|2|And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,
Acts|24|3|we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts|24|4|But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.
Acts|24|5|For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
Acts|24|6|
Acts|24|7|
Acts|24|8|from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.
Acts|24|9|And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.
Acts|24|10|And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:
Acts|24|11|Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:
Acts|24|12|and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
Acts|24|13|Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.
Acts|24|14|But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
Acts|24|15|having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.
Acts|24|16|Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.
Acts|24|17|Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:
Acts|24|18|certain Jews from Asia--
Acts|24|19|who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.
Acts|24|20|Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,
Acts|24|21|except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.
Acts|24|22|But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.
Acts|24|23|And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.
Acts|24|24|But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
Acts|24|25|And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.
Acts|24|26|He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
Acts|24|27|
Acts|25|1|Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Acts|25|2|And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,
Acts|25|3|asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.
Acts|25|4|shortly.
Acts|25|5|Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.
Acts|25|6|And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
Acts|25|7|And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;
Acts|25|8|while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.
Acts|25|9|But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
Acts|25|10|But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar’s judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.
Acts|25|11|whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
Acts|25|12|Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.
Acts|25|13|Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus.
Acts|25|14|And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
Acts|25|15|, asking for sentence against him.
Acts|25|16|To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
Acts|25|17|When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.
Acts|25|18|Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;
Acts|25|19|but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Acts|25|20|And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.
Acts|25|21|But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar.
Acts|25|22|unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.
Acts|25|23|So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.
Acts|25|24|And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts|25|25|But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.
Acts|25|26|Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.
Acts|25|27|
Acts|26|1|And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:
Acts|26|2|I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:
Acts|26|3|especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Acts|26|4|My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
Acts|26|5|having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
Acts|26|6|to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;
Acts|26|7|night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!
Acts|26|8|Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?
Acts|26|9|I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Acts|26|10|And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
Acts|26|11|And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.
Acts|26|12|Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
Acts|26|13|at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.
Acts|26|14|And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.
Acts|26|15|And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
Acts|26|16|But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;
Acts|26|17|delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,
Acts|26|18|to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.
Acts|26|19|Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
Acts|26|20|but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
Acts|26|21|For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.
Acts|26|22|Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;
Acts|26|23|how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.
Acts|26|24|And as he thus made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.
Acts|26|25|But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.
Acts|26|26|For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.
Acts|26|27|King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
Acts|26|28|unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.
Acts|26|29|, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.
Acts|26|30|And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
Acts|26|31|and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts|26|32|
Acts|27|1|And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.
Acts|27|2|And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Acts|27|3|And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.
Acts|27|4|And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
Acts|27|5|of Lycia.
Acts|27|6|And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.
Acts|27|7|And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;
Acts|27|8|and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.
Acts|27|9|And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,
Acts|27|10|and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.
Acts|27|11|But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
Acts|27|12|a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.
Acts|27|13|And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.
Acts|27|14|But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:
Acts|27|15|and were driven.
Acts|27|16|And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:
Acts|27|17|and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.
Acts|27|18|overboard;
Acts|27|19|and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
Acts|27|20|all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.
Acts|27|21|And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
Acts|27|22|of the ship.
Acts|27|23|For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,
Acts|27|24|saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.
Acts|27|25|Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.
Acts|27|26|But we must be cast upon a certain island.
Acts|27|27|Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:
Acts|27|28|and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.
Acts|27|29|And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.
Acts|27|30|And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,
Acts|27|31|Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Acts|27|32|Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
Acts|27|33|And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
Acts|27|34|Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.
Acts|27|35|And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.
Acts|27|36|Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.
Acts|27|37|And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
Acts|27|38|And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts|27|39|And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.
Acts|27|40|And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
Acts|27|41|.
Acts|27|42|should swim out, and escape.
Acts|27|43|But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;
Acts|27|44|
Acts|28|1|And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.
Acts|28|2|And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
Acts|28|3|But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
Acts|28|4|creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.
Acts|28|5|Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.
Acts|28|6|But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
Acts|28|7|Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.
Acts|28|8|And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.
Acts|28|9|And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:
Acts|28|10|who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.
Acts|28|11|And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.
Acts|28|12|And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
Acts|28|13|And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;
Acts|28|14|where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.
Acts|28|15|And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
Acts|28|16|And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
Acts|28|17|And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:
Acts|28|18|who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.
Acts|28|19|But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.
Acts|28|20|: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Acts|28|21|And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.
Acts|28|22|But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.
Acts|28|23|testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.
Acts|28|24|And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
Acts|28|25|And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,
Acts|28|26|
Acts|28|27|
Acts|28|28|Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.
Acts|28|29|
Acts|28|30|And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,
Acts|28|31|
Micah|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
Micah|1|2|Hear, ye peoples, all of you: hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
Micah|1|3|For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
Micah|1|4|And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.
Micah|1|5|For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
Micah|1|6|as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.
Micah|1|7|And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.
Micah|1|8|For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.
Micah|1|9|For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
Micah|1|10|Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.
Micah|1|11|Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.
Micah|1|12|For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem.
Micah|1|13|Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
Micah|1|14|Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
Micah|1|15|I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.
Micah|1|16|
Micah|2|1|Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
Micah|2|2|And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
Micah|2|3|Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
Micah|2|4|from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.
Micah|2|5|Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.
Micah|2|6|they prophesy. They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.
Micah|2|7|Shall it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Jehovah straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
Micah|2|8|averse from war.
Micah|2|9|The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.
Micah|2|10|Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.
Micah|2|11|, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
Micah|2|12|men.
Micah|2|13|
Micah|3|1|And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
Micah|3|2|ye who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Micah|3|3|who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
Micah|3|4|Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.
Micah|3|5|Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
Micah|3|6|Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
Micah|3|7|And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.
Micah|3|8|But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Micah|3|9|Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity.
Micah|3|10|They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
Micah|3|11|The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
Micah|3|12|
Micah|4|1|But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.
Micah|4|2|And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;
Micah|4|3|and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
Micah|4|4|But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.
Micah|4|5|For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.
Micah|4|6|In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;
Micah|4|7|and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.
Micah|4|8|And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Micah|4|9|Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?
Micah|4|10|Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will Jehovah redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
Micah|4|11|upon Zion.
Micah|4|12|But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.
Micah|4|13|
Micah|5|1|Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
Micah|5|2|But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.
Micah|5|3|Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
Micah|5|4|in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
Micah|5|5|peace. When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
Micah|5|6|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.
Micah|5|7|And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
Micah|5|8|And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
Micah|5|9|Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.
Micah|5|10|And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots:
Micah|5|11|and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.
Micah|5|12|soothsayers:
Micah|5|13|and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands;
Micah|5|14|and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.
Micah|5|15|
Micah|6|1|Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
Micah|6|2|Hear, O ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
Micah|6|3|O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
Micah|6|4|For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
Micah|6|5|from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.
Micah|6|6|Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old?
Micah|6|7|with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
Micah|6|8|He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?
Micah|6|9|wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
Micah|6|10|Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable?
Micah|6|11|Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights?
Micah|6|12|For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Micah|6|13|Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.
Micah|6|14|Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.
Micah|6|15|Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.
Micah|6|16|
Micah|7|1|Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.
Micah|7|2|The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
Micah|7|3|for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.
Micah|7|4|than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.
Micah|7|5|Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
Micah|7|6|For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
Micah|7|7|But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
Micah|7|8|Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.
Micah|7|9|I shall behold his righteousness.
Micah|7|10|upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
Micah|7|11|A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.
Micah|7|12|mountain to mountain.
Micah|7|13|Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
Micah|7|14|Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
Micah|7|15|As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.
Micah|7|16|The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
Micah|7|17|They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.
Micah|7|18|Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.
Micah|7|19|He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Micah|7|20|
Joel|1|1|The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
Joel|1|2|Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
Joel|1|3|their children, and their children another generation.
Joel|1|4|That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
Joel|1|5|Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
Joel|1|6|For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
Joel|1|7|He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
Joel|1|8|Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
Joel|1|9|The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn.
Joel|1|10|The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
Joel|1|11|Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.
Joel|1|12|The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.
Joel|1|13|, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.
Joel|1|14|all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.
Joel|1|15|Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
Joel|1|16|, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
Joel|1|17|The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.
Joel|1|18|How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
Joel|1|19|O Jehovah, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
Joel|1|20|
Joel|2|1|Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;
Joel|2|2|a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.
Joel|2|3|A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.
Joel|2|4|The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.
Joel|2|5|Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
Joel|2|6|At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.
Joel|2|7|They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.
Joel|2|8|.
Joel|2|9|They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.
Joel|2|10|The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|2|11|And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?
Joel|2|12|Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:
Joel|2|13|and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.
Joel|2|14|Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?
Joel|2|15|Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;
Joel|2|16|gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.
Joel|2|17|Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
Joel|2|18|Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.
Joel|2|19|And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;
Joel|2|20|, and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.
Joel|2|21|Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.
Joel|2|22|Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
Joel|2|23|.
Joel|2|24|And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
Joel|2|25|And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
Joel|2|26|And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.
Joel|2|27|And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.
Joel|2|28|And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
Joel|2|29|and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
Joel|2|30|And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
Joel|2|31|The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.
Joel|2|32|
Joel|3|1|For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
Joel|3|2|I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment upon them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land,
Joel|3|3|and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.
Joel|3|4|Yea, and what are ye to me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head.
Joel|3|5|Forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things,
Joel|3|6|and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye may remove them far from their border;
Joel|3|7|behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompense upon your own head;
Joel|3|8|and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken it.
Joel|3|9|Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.
Joel|3|10|Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.
Joel|3|11|Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.
Joel|3|12|Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
Joel|3|13|Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
Joel|3|14|Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.
Joel|3|15|The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
Joel|3|16|And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but Jehovah will be a refuge unto his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.
Joel|3|17|So shall ye know that I am Jehovah your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
Joel|3|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.
Joel|3|19|Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
Joel|3|20|But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
Joel|3|21|
Job|1|1|There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.
Job|1|2|And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
Job|1|3|His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.
Job|1|4|And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
Job|1|5|And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
Job|1|6|Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.
Job|1|7|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|1|8|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.
Job|1|9|Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Job|1|10|Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
Job|1|11|But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|1|12|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.
Job|1|13|And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
Job|1|14|that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;
Job|1|15|, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|16|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|17|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|18|While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;
Job|1|19|and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Job|1|20|Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;
Job|1|21|and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.
Job|1|22|
Job|2|1|Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
Job|2|2|And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
Job|2|3|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
Job|2|4|And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
Job|2|5|But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
Job|2|6|And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.
Job|2|7|So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
Job|2|8|And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.
Job|2|9|Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.
Job|2|10|But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
Job|2|11|Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
Job|2|12|And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
Job|2|13|
Job|3|1|After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

Job|32|1|So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Job|32|2|Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Job|32|3|Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Job|32|4|Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.

Job|42|7|And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
Job|42|8|Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
Job|42|9|
Job|42|10|And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Job|42|11|Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.
Job|42|12|So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
Job|42|13|He had also seven sons and three daughters.
Job|42|14|And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
Job|42|15|And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
Job|42|16|four generations.
Job|42|17|
Ezra|1|1|also in writing, saying,
Ezra|1|2|Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
Ezra|1|3|Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|4|And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|5|of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|6|And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
Ezra|1|7|Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;
Ezra|1|8|even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
Ezra|1|9|And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,
Ezra|1|10|thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
Ezra|1|11|

Ezra|2|59|Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
Ezra|2|60|the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
Ezra|2|61|And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
Ezra|2|62|those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
Ezra|2|63|And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
Ezra|2|64|The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
Ezra|2|65|besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
Ezra|2|66|Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
Ezra|2|67|asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
Ezra|2|68|, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place:
Ezra|2|69|they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.
Ezra|2|70|
Ezra|3|1|And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
Ezra|3|2|Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
Ezra|3|3|And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.
Ezra|3|4|the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;
Ezra|3|5|of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|3|6|From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.
Ezra|3|7|They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
Ezra|3|8|Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|3|9|Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
Ezra|3|10|And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.
Ezra|3|11|for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
Ezra|3|12|, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
Ezra|3|13|
Ezra|4|1|Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;
Ezra|4|2|, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.
Ezra|4|3|of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
Ezra|4|4|Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
Ezra|4|5|and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra|4|6|And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra|4|7|.
Ezra|4|8|Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
Ezra|4|9|Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,
Ezra|4|10|beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|11|This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.
Ezra|4|12|Be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.
Ezra|4|13|Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful unto the kings.
Ezra|4|14|Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
Ezra|4|15|that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste.
Ezra|4|16|We certify the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.
Ezra|4|17|beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.
Ezra|4|18|The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
Ezra|4|19|And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
Ezra|4|20|beyond the River; and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid unto them.
Ezra|4|21|Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me.
Ezra|4|22|And take heed that ye be not slack herein: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
Ezra|4|23|Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
Ezra|4|24|
Ezra|5|1|unto them.
Ezra|5|2|Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.
Ezra|5|3|At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|4|Then we told them after this manner, what the names of the men were that were making this building.
Ezra|5|5|But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.
Ezra|5|6|The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king;
Ezra|5|7|they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: Unto Darius the king, all peace.
Ezra|5|8|Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands.
Ezra|5|9|Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?
Ezra|5|10|We asked them their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.
Ezra|5|11|And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished.
Ezra|5|12|But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
Ezra|5|13|But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.
Ezra|5|14|And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
Ezra|5|15|and he said unto him, Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place.
Ezra|5|16|Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.
Ezra|5|17|
Ezra|6|1|Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
Ezra|6|2|And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written for a record:
Ezra|6|3|In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
Ezra|6|4|with three courses of great stones, and a course of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.
Ezra|6|5|And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place; and thou shalt put them in the house of God.
Ezra|6|6|Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence:
Ezra|6|7|let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place.
Ezra|6|8|Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered.
Ezra|6|9|wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail;
Ezra|6|10|that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
Ezra|6|11|Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this:
Ezra|6|12|, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.
Ezra|6|13|Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had sent, did accordingly with all diligence.
Ezra|6|14|And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
Ezra|6|15|And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
Ezra|6|16|And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.
Ezra|6|17|And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Ezra|6|18|And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
Ezra|6|19|of the first month.
Ezra|6|20|For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure: and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
Ezra|6|21|And the children of Israel that were come again out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, did eat,
Ezra|6|22|
Ezra|7|1|Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
Ezra|7|2|the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
Ezra|7|3|the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
Ezra|7|4|the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
Ezra|7|5|the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;
Ezra|7|6|this Ezra went up from Babylon: and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which Jehovah, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.
Ezra|7|7|And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
Ezra|7|8|And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
Ezra|7|9|of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
Ezra|7|10|For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.
Ezra|7|11|Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel:
Ezra|7|12|Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.
Ezra|7|13|I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
Ezra|7|14|Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,
Ezra|7|15|and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
Ezra|7|16|and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|17|therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|18|And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God.
Ezra|7|19|And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
Ezra|7|20|And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure-house.
Ezra|7|21|And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence,
Ezra|7|22|unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
Ezra|7|23|Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
Ezra|7|24|Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, upon them.
Ezra|7|25|And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not.
Ezra|7|26|And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
Ezra|7|27|Blessed be Jehovah, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem;
Ezra|7|28|

Ezra|8|14|And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud; and with them seventy males.
Ezra|8|15|And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
Ezra|8|16|Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, who were teachers.
Ezra|8|17|his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra|8|18|And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
Ezra|8|19|and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
Ezra|8|20|and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were mentioned by name.
Ezra|8|21|Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
Ezra|8|22|For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
Ezra|8|23|So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated of us.
Ezra|8|24|Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
Ezra|8|25|and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered:
Ezra|8|26|I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents;
Ezra|8|27|and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.
Ezra|8|28|And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers.
Ezra|8|29|of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|8|30|So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
Ezra|8|31|of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the lier-in-wait by the way.
Ezra|8|32|And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
Ezra|8|33|And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite;
Ezra|8|34|the whole by number and by weight: and all the weight was written at that time.
Ezra|8|35|The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt-offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|8|36|
Ezra|9|1|according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
Ezra|9|2|For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
Ezra|9|3|And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
Ezra|9|4|Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.
Ezra|9|5|And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto Jehovah my God;
Ezra|9|6|and I said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens.
Ezra|9|7|Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
Ezra|9|8|And now for a little moment grace hath been showed from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
Ezra|9|9|For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended lovingkindness unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
Ezra|9|10|And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
Ezra|9|11|which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness:
Ezra|9|12|now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
Ezra|9|13|And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant,
Ezra|9|14|shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?
Ezra|9|15|
Ezra|10|1|Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
Ezra|10|2|And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
Ezra|10|3|Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
Ezra|10|4|Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
Ezra|10|5|Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they sware.
Ezra|10|6|he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.
Ezra|10|7|And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
Ezra|10|8|and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
Ezra|10|9|of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
Ezra|10|10|And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.
Ezra|10|11|Now therefore make confession unto Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
Ezra|10|12|Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.
Ezra|10|13|But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
Ezra|10|14|Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
Ezra|10|15|: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
Ezra|10|16|, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
Ezra|10|17|And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
Ezra|10|18|, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
Ezra|10|19|a ram of the flock for their guilt.

Ezra|10|23|And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
Ezra|10|24|And of the singers: Eliashib. And of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
Ezra|10|25|And of Israel: Of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
Ezra|10|26|And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah.
Ezra|10|27|And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
Ezra|10|28|And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai.
Ezra|10|29|And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, Jeremoth.

Ezra|10|43|Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.
Ezra|10|44|
Leviticus|1|1|And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus|1|2|
Leviticus|1|3|If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.
Leviticus|1|4|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Leviticus|1|5|And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|1|6|And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus|1|7|And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;
Leviticus|1|8|and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|9|
Leviticus|1|10|And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.
Leviticus|1|11|And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|1|12|And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus|1|13|
Leviticus|1|14|And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.
Leviticus|1|15|And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;
Leviticus|1|16|and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:
Leviticus|1|17|
Leviticus|2|1|And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
Leviticus|2|2|the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah:
Leviticus|2|3|
Leviticus|2|4|And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
Leviticus|2|5|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
Leviticus|2|6|Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus|2|7|And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
Leviticus|2|8|And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.
Leviticus|2|9|And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|10|
Leviticus|2|11|No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|2|12|ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
Leviticus|2|13|
Leviticus|2|14|And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
Leviticus|2|15|And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus|2|16|
Leviticus|3|1|And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah.
Leviticus|3|2|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|3|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|4|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|5|
Leviticus|3|6|And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
Leviticus|3|7|If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;
Leviticus|3|8|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|9|And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|10|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|11|
Leviticus|3|12|And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:
Leviticus|3|13|and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|3|14|an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|3|15|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus|3|16|And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|3|17|
Leviticus|4|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|4|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:
Leviticus|4|3|if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|4|And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|5|And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|6|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|4|7|And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|8|And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus|4|9|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,
Leviticus|4|10|as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|11|And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,
Leviticus|4|12|
Leviticus|4|13|And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
Leviticus|4|14|when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|15|And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|4|16|And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus|4|17|and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.
Leviticus|4|18|And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|4|19|And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.
Leviticus|4|20|Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|4|21|
Leviticus|4|22|When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;
Leviticus|4|23|if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.
Leviticus|4|24|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|4|25|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|26|
Leviticus|4|27|And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;
Leviticus|4|28|if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
Leviticus|4|29|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|30|And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus|4|31|
Leviticus|4|32|And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
Leviticus|4|33|And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.
Leviticus|4|34|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:
Leviticus|4|35|
Leviticus|5|1|, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|2|Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|3|Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus|5|4|.
Leviticus|5|5|, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:
Leviticus|5|6|
Leviticus|5|7|And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|5|8|And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
Leviticus|5|9|and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|10|
Leviticus|5|11|But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|12|And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus|5|13|
Leviticus|5|14|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|5|15|If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
Leviticus|5|16|
Leviticus|5|17|And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|5|18|And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus|5|19|
Leviticus|6|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|2|If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,
Leviticus|6|3|or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;
Leviticus|6|4|then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,
Leviticus|6|5|or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.
Leviticus|6|6|And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:
Leviticus|6|7|
Leviticus|6|8|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|9|Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.
Leviticus|6|10|And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
Leviticus|6|11|And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
Leviticus|6|12|And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|6|13|
Leviticus|6|14|And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar.
Leviticus|6|15|And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|16|And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus|6|17|It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
Leviticus|6|18|
Leviticus|6|19|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|20|This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.
Leviticus|6|21|On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|22|And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|6|23|
Leviticus|6|24|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|6|25|Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy.
Leviticus|6|26|The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|6|27|Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.
Leviticus|6|28|But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
Leviticus|6|29|Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
Leviticus|6|30|
Leviticus|7|1|And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.
Leviticus|7|2|In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|7|3|And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
Leviticus|7|4|and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;
Leviticus|7|5|and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering.
Leviticus|7|6|Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.
Leviticus|7|7|As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it.
Leviticus|7|8|And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.
Leviticus|7|9|And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.
Leviticus|7|10|
Leviticus|7|11|And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|7|12|If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.
Leviticus|7|13|With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.
Leviticus|7|14|
Leviticus|7|15|And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Leviticus|7|16|But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:
Leviticus|7|17|but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|7|18|
Leviticus|7|19|And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:
Leviticus|7|20|but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|21|
Leviticus|7|22|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|7|23|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.
Leviticus|7|24|And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
Leviticus|7|25|For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|7|26|And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
Leviticus|7|27|
Leviticus|7|28|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|7|29|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:
Leviticus|7|30|his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|7|31|And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
Leviticus|7|32|And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
Leviticus|7|33|He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.
Leviticus|7|34|
Leviticus|7|35|This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priest’s office;
Leviticus|7|36|
Leviticus|7|37|This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;
Leviticus|7|38|
Leviticus|8|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|8|2|Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
Leviticus|8|3|and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|8|4|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|8|5|
Leviticus|8|6|And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
Leviticus|8|7|And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
Leviticus|8|8|And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.
Leviticus|8|9|
Leviticus|8|10|And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
Leviticus|8|11|And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
Leviticus|8|12|And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
Leviticus|8|13|
Leviticus|8|14|And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
Leviticus|8|15|And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
Leviticus|8|16|And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.
Leviticus|8|17|
Leviticus|8|18|And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus|8|19|And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|8|20|And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
Leviticus|8|21|
Leviticus|8|22|And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus|8|23|And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|8|24|And he brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|8|25|And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:
Leviticus|8|26|and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:
Leviticus|8|27|and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|8|28|And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|8|29|
Leviticus|8|30|
Leviticus|8|31|And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus|8|32|And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus|8|33|And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
Leviticus|8|34|As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
Leviticus|8|35|And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus|8|36|
Leviticus|9|1|And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus|9|2|and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.
Leviticus|9|3|And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus|9|4|and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.
Leviticus|9|5|And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.
Leviticus|9|6|And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.
Leviticus|9|7|
Leviticus|9|8|So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
Leviticus|9|9|And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
Leviticus|9|10|but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus|9|11|
Leviticus|9|12|And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
Leviticus|9|13|And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
Leviticus|9|14|
Leviticus|9|15|And he presented the people’s oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
Leviticus|9|16|And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus|9|17|
Leviticus|9|18|He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
Leviticus|9|19|, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:
Leviticus|9|20|and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Leviticus|9|21|
Leviticus|9|22|And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
Leviticus|9|23|And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.
Leviticus|9|24|
Leviticus|10|1|And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus|10|2|And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
Leviticus|10|3|Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus|10|4|And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus|10|5|So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus|10|6|And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.
Leviticus|10|7|
Leviticus|10|8|And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|10|9|Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
Leviticus|10|10|and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus|10|11|
Leviticus|10|12|And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;
Leviticus|10|13|and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus|10|14|And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
Leviticus|10|15|
Leviticus|10|16|And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
Leviticus|10|17|Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|18|Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Leviticus|10|19|And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?
Leviticus|10|20|
Leviticus|11|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus|11|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus|11|3|cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|4|Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|5|And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|6|And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|7|And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|8|
Leviticus|11|9|These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.
Leviticus|11|10|And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
Leviticus|11|11|and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
Leviticus|11|12|
Leviticus|11|13|And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Leviticus|11|14|and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,
Leviticus|11|15|every raven after its kind,
Leviticus|11|16|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,
Leviticus|11|17|and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
Leviticus|11|18|and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,
Leviticus|11|19|
Leviticus|11|20|All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus|11|21|Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|22|Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
Leviticus|11|23|
Leviticus|11|24|And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;
Leviticus|11|25|of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|26|Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|27|And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|28|
Leviticus|11|29|And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,
Leviticus|11|30|and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus|11|31|These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|32|And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.
Leviticus|11|33|And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.
Leviticus|11|34|vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|35|of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
Leviticus|11|36|Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus|11|37|of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus|11|38|
Leviticus|11|39|And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|11|40|
Leviticus|11|41|And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|11|42|Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
Leviticus|11|43|Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
Leviticus|11|44|For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.
Leviticus|11|45|
Leviticus|11|46|This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
Leviticus|11|47|
Leviticus|12|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|12|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.
Leviticus|12|3|And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus|12|4|purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
Leviticus|12|5|
Leviticus|12|6|And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:
Leviticus|12|7|and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus|12|8|
Leviticus|13|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|13|2|When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
Leviticus|13|3|and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus|13|4|the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|5|and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|6|and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|7|But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:
Leviticus|13|8|
Leviticus|13|9|When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
Leviticus|13|10|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,
Leviticus|13|11|it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|12|the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;
Leviticus|13|13|the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
Leviticus|13|14|But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus|13|15|And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus|13|16|Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;
Leviticus|13|17|
Leviticus|13|18|And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,
Leviticus|13|19|and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;
Leviticus|13|20|and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.
Leviticus|13|21|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|22|And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
Leviticus|13|23|
Leviticus|13|24|of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;
Leviticus|13|25|then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|26|But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus|13|27|and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus|13|28|
Leviticus|13|29|And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,
Leviticus|13|30|then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus|13|31|the plague of the scall seven days:
Leviticus|13|32|And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,
Leviticus|13|33|the scall seven days more:
Leviticus|13|34|and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus|13|35|But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,
Leviticus|13|36|then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus|13|37|
Leviticus|13|38|And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
Leviticus|13|39|
Leviticus|13|40|is he clean.
Leviticus|13|41|is he clean.
Leviticus|13|42|But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
Leviticus|13|43|Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;
Leviticus|13|44|
Leviticus|13|45|And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
Leviticus|13|46|
Leviticus|13|47|The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
Leviticus|13|48|whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;
Leviticus|13|49|if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.
Leviticus|13|50|the plague seven days:
Leviticus|13|51|and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus|13|52|
Leviticus|13|53|And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;
Leviticus|13|54|then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
Leviticus|13|55|
Leviticus|13|56|And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
Leviticus|13|57|and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
Leviticus|13|58|
Leviticus|13|59|
Leviticus|14|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|14|2|This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus|14|3|and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,
Leviticus|14|4|then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|5|And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
Leviticus|14|6|As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
Leviticus|14|7|And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.
Leviticus|14|8|And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.
Leviticus|14|9|
Leviticus|14|10|of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
Leviticus|14|11|And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|14|12|And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|13|and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:
Leviticus|14|14|and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|15|And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|16|and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|17|and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|18|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|19|And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;
Leviticus|14|20|
Leviticus|14|21|of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;
Leviticus|14|22|and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|14|23|And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|24|and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|25|And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus|14|26|And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus|14|27|and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus|14|28|and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus|14|29|and the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|30|And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,
Leviticus|14|31|even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
Leviticus|14|32|
Leviticus|14|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|14|34|When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
Leviticus|14|35|then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.
Leviticus|14|36|And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
Leviticus|14|37|and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;
Leviticus|14|38|then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
Leviticus|14|39|And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
Leviticus|14|40|then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:
Leviticus|14|41|and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:
Leviticus|14|42|
Leviticus|14|43|And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
Leviticus|14|44|then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
Leviticus|14|45|And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
Leviticus|14|46|Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|14|47|
Leviticus|14|48|And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
Leviticus|14|49|And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus|14|50|and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus|14|51|and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
Leviticus|14|52|and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
Leviticus|14|53|
Leviticus|14|54|This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,
Leviticus|14|55|and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
Leviticus|14|56|and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
Leviticus|14|57|
Leviticus|15|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus|15|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
Leviticus|15|3|And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.
Leviticus|15|4|Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|5|And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|6|And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|7|And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|8|And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|9|And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|10|And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|11|And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|12|
Leviticus|15|13|And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|14|And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:
Leviticus|15|15|
Leviticus|15|16|And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|17|And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|18|
Leviticus|15|19|her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|20|And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus|15|21|And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|22|And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|23|And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|24|
Leviticus|15|25|And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.
Leviticus|15|26|Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.
Leviticus|15|27|And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus|15|28|But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
Leviticus|15|29|And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|15|30|
Leviticus|15|31|
Leviticus|15|32|This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;
Leviticus|15|33|
Leviticus|16|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;
Leviticus|16|2|and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
Leviticus|16|3|Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus|16|4|He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
Leviticus|16|5|
Leviticus|16|6|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
Leviticus|16|7|And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus|16|8|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.
Leviticus|16|9|And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.
Leviticus|16|10|
Leviticus|16|11|And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:
Leviticus|16|12|and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:
Leviticus|16|13|and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
Leviticus|16|14|
Leviticus|16|15|Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
Leviticus|16|16|and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
Leviticus|16|17|And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
Leviticus|16|18|And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
Leviticus|16|19|
Leviticus|16|20|And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:
Leviticus|16|21|and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:
Leviticus|16|22|
Leviticus|16|23|And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
Leviticus|16|24|and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus|16|25|And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
Leviticus|16|26|And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus|16|27|And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
Leviticus|16|28|
Leviticus|16|29|And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:
Leviticus|16|30|for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.
Leviticus|16|31|It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.
Leviticus|16|32|And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his father’s stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:
Leviticus|16|33|and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus|16|34|
Leviticus|17|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|17|2|Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,
Leviticus|17|3|What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,
Leviticus|17|4|and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
Leviticus|17|5|To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|6|And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|17|7|
Leviticus|17|8|And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
Leviticus|17|9|
Leviticus|17|10|And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus|17|11|For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.
Leviticus|17|12|Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
Leviticus|17|13|
Leviticus|17|14|with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
Leviticus|17|15|And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
Leviticus|17|16|
Leviticus|18|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|18|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|3|After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
Leviticus|18|4|Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|18|5|
Leviticus|18|6|nakedness: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|7|The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|8|The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father’s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|9|The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
Leviticus|18|10|The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.
Leviticus|18|11|The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|12|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is thy father’s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|13|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.
Leviticus|18|14|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
Leviticus|18|15|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus|18|16|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.
Leviticus|18|17|Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
Leviticus|18|18|
Leviticus|18|19|And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
Leviticus|18|20|And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor’s wife, to defile thyself with her.
Leviticus|18|21|to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|18|22|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
Leviticus|18|23|
Leviticus|18|24|Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;
Leviticus|18|25|And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.
Leviticus|18|26|Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;
Leviticus|18|27|(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);
Leviticus|18|28|that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus|18|29|For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus|18|30|
Leviticus|19|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|19|2|Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy.
Leviticus|19|3|Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|19|4|
Leviticus|19|5|And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus|19|6|It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus|19|7|And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:
Leviticus|19|8|
Leviticus|19|9|And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
Leviticus|19|10|
Leviticus|19|11|Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
Leviticus|19|12|
Leviticus|19|13|Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
Leviticus|19|14|
Leviticus|19|15|Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
Leviticus|19|16|
Leviticus|19|17|Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
Leviticus|19|18|
Leviticus|19|19|Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
Leviticus|19|20|And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
Leviticus|19|21|And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
Leviticus|19|22|And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him.
Leviticus|19|23|And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus|19|24|But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|19|25|
Leviticus|19|26|Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.
Leviticus|19|27|Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
Leviticus|19|28|
Leviticus|19|29|Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
Leviticus|19|30|
Leviticus|19|31|
Leviticus|19|32|
Leviticus|19|33|And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
Leviticus|19|34|
Leviticus|19|35|Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
Leviticus|19|36|Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Leviticus|19|37|
Leviticus|20|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|20|2|Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus|20|3|I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
Leviticus|20|4|And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death;
Leviticus|20|5|
Leviticus|20|6|And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus|20|7|Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|20|8|And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.
Leviticus|20|9|
Leviticus|20|10|And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|20|11|And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|12|And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|13|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus|20|14|And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
Leviticus|20|15|And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
Leviticus|20|16|
Leviticus|20|17|And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus|20|18|And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus|20|19|And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
Leviticus|20|20|And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
Leviticus|20|21|
Leviticus|20|22|Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.
Leviticus|20|23|And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus|20|24|But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus|20|25|Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.
Leviticus|20|26|
Leviticus|20|27|
Leviticus|21|1|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;
Leviticus|21|2|except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
Leviticus|21|3|and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.
Leviticus|21|4|a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
Leviticus|21|5|They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
Leviticus|21|6|They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus|21|7|They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
Leviticus|21|8|Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.
Leviticus|21|9|
Leviticus|21|10|And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;
Leviticus|21|11|neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
Leviticus|21|12|neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|21|13|And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus|21|14|A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.
Leviticus|21|15|
Leviticus|21|16|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|21|17|Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus|21|18|For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,
Leviticus|21|19|or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
Leviticus|21|20|or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
Leviticus|21|21|no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus|21|22|He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:
Leviticus|21|23|only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus|21|24|
Leviticus|22|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|2|Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|3|Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|4|What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Leviticus|22|5|or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Leviticus|22|6|the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
Leviticus|22|7|And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
Leviticus|22|8|That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|9|
Leviticus|22|10|There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|11|But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
Leviticus|22|12|And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.
Leviticus|22|13|But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
Leviticus|22|14|And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
Leviticus|22|15|And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,
Leviticus|22|16|
Leviticus|22|17|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|18|Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus|22|19|a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Leviticus|22|20|But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus|22|21|And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Leviticus|22|22|Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|23|Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Leviticus|22|24|in your land.
Leviticus|22|25|
Leviticus|22|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|22|27|When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|28|And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
Leviticus|22|29|And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus|22|30|On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|31|Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus|22|32|And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,
Leviticus|22|33|
Leviticus|23|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Leviticus|23|3|
Leviticus|23|4|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
Leviticus|23|5|In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovah’s passover.
Leviticus|23|6|And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus|23|7|In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|8|
Leviticus|23|9|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|10|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Leviticus|23|11|and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus|23|12|And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|13|of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
Leviticus|23|14|
Leviticus|23|15|And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:
Leviticus|23|16|even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|17|: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|18|And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|19|And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Leviticus|23|20|And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.
Leviticus|23|21|
Leviticus|23|22|
Leviticus|23|23|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|24|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
Leviticus|23|25|
Leviticus|23|26|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|27|Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|28|And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|29|For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus|23|30|And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Leviticus|23|31|Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus|23|32|
Leviticus|23|33|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|23|34|Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|23|35|On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus|23|36|
Leviticus|23|37|These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
Leviticus|23|38|
Leviticus|23|39|Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Leviticus|23|40|And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.
Leviticus|23|41|And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus|23|42|Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
Leviticus|23|43|that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|23|44|
Leviticus|24|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|2|Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus|24|3|Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Leviticus|24|4|
Leviticus|24|5|shall be in one cake.
Leviticus|24|6|And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|7|And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|24|8|Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus|24|9|
Leviticus|24|10|And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:
Leviticus|24|11|and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus|24|12|
Leviticus|24|13|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|24|14|Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus|24|15|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus|24|16|, shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|17|And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus|24|18|And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus|24|19|And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:
Leviticus|24|20|breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
Leviticus|24|21|And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus|24|22|Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|24|23|
Leviticus|25|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus|25|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|25|3|Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;
Leviticus|25|4|but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Leviticus|25|5|That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Leviticus|25|6|And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.
Leviticus|25|7|
Leviticus|25|8|And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.
Leviticus|25|9|Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus|25|10|And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Leviticus|25|11|in it of the undressed vines.
Leviticus|25|12|
Leviticus|25|13|In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|14|And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus|25|15|according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|16|According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.
Leviticus|25|17|
Leviticus|25|18|Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus|25|19|And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Leviticus|25|20|And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;
Leviticus|25|21|then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
Leviticus|25|22|
Leviticus|25|23|And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus|25|24|And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus|25|25|If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.
Leviticus|25|26|And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
Leviticus|25|27|then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus|25|28|
Leviticus|25|29|And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.
Leviticus|25|30|And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|31|But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus|25|32|Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Leviticus|25|33|And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Leviticus|25|34|
Leviticus|25|35|a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
Leviticus|25|36|Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Leviticus|25|37|Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
Leviticus|25|38|
Leviticus|25|39|And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant.
Leviticus|25|40|As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:
Leviticus|25|41|then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Leviticus|25|42|For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus|25|43|Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus|25|44|And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus|25|45|Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus|25|46|
Leviticus|25|47|sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family;
Leviticus|25|48|after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;
Leviticus|25|49|or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus|25|50|And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
Leviticus|25|51|If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Leviticus|25|52|And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
Leviticus|25|53|As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
Leviticus|25|54|, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.
Leviticus|25|55|
Leviticus|26|1|Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus|26|2|
Leviticus|26|3|If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus|26|4|then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Leviticus|26|5|And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
Leviticus|26|6|And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
Leviticus|26|7|And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|8|And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus|26|9|And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
Leviticus|26|10|And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.
Leviticus|26|11|And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus|26|12|And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
Leviticus|26|13|
Leviticus|26|14|But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
Leviticus|26|15|and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;
Leviticus|26|16|I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus|26|17|And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
Leviticus|26|18|And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus|26|19|And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;
Leviticus|26|20|
Leviticus|26|21|And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus|26|22|And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
Leviticus|26|23|And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|24|then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|25|And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus|26|26|
Leviticus|26|27|And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus|26|28|then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus|26|29|And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
Leviticus|26|30|And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus|26|31|And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
Leviticus|26|32|And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus|26|33|
Leviticus|26|34|Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus|26|35|As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
Leviticus|26|36|And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
Leviticus|26|37|And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus|26|38|And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus|26|39|
Leviticus|26|40|And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,
Leviticus|26|41|I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
Leviticus|26|42|then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
Leviticus|26|43|The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Leviticus|26|44|And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;
Leviticus|26|45|
Leviticus|26|46|
Leviticus|27|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus|27|2|Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|3|And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus|27|4|And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus|27|5|And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|6|And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|7|And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus|27|8|
Leviticus|27|9|And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|10|He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
Leviticus|27|11|And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;
Leviticus|27|12|and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
Leviticus|27|13|
Leviticus|27|14|And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
Leviticus|27|15|
Leviticus|27|16|at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus|27|17|If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
Leviticus|27|18|But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
Leviticus|27|19|And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
Leviticus|27|20|And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:
Leviticus|27|21|but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
Leviticus|27|22|And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;
Leviticus|27|23|then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|24|In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.
Leviticus|27|25|
Leviticus|27|26|Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovah’s.
Leviticus|27|27|
Leviticus|27|28|Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|29|
Leviticus|27|30|And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s: it is holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|31|And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.
Leviticus|27|32|And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus|27|33|
Leviticus|27|34|
2 Corinthians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:
2 Corinthians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|3|the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
2 Corinthians|1|4|who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
2 Corinthians|1|5|For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.
2 Corinthians|1|6|But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:
2 Corinthians|1|7|and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.
2 Corinthians|1|8|in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
2 Corinthians|1|9|yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:
2 Corinthians|1|10|who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;
2 Corinthians|1|11|ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
2 Corinthians|1|12|For our glorifying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
2 Corinthians|1|13|For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:
2 Corinthians|1|14|as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
2 Corinthians|1|15|And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;
2 Corinthians|1|16|and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.
2 Corinthians|1|17|When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?
2 Corinthians|1|18|But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.
2 Corinthians|1|19|by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.
2 Corinthians|1|20|For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.
2 Corinthians|1|21|Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;
2 Corinthians|1|22|the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2 Corinthians|1|23|But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.
2 Corinthians|1|24|
2 Corinthians|2|1|But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|2|For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?
2 Corinthians|2|3|of you all.
2 Corinthians|2|4|For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.
2 Corinthians|2|5|But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.
2 Corinthians|2|6|by the many;
2 Corinthians|2|7|so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.
2 Corinthians|2|8|love toward him.
2 Corinthians|2|9|For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
2 Corinthians|2|10|in the presence of Christ;
2 Corinthians|2|11|that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians|2|12|Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,
2 Corinthians|2|13|I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
2 Corinthians|2|14|But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.
2 Corinthians|2|15|For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;
2 Corinthians|2|16|to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians|2|17|
2 Corinthians|3|1|Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?
2 Corinthians|3|2|Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;
2 Corinthians|3|3|hearts of flesh.
2 Corinthians|3|4|And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:
2 Corinthians|3|5|not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;
2 Corinthians|3|6|who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2 Corinthians|3|7|was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|8|how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?
2 Corinthians|3|9|For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|10|For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.
2 Corinthians|3|11|in glory.
2 Corinthians|3|12|Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,
2 Corinthians|3|13|put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:
2 Corinthians|3|14|that it is done away in Christ.
2 Corinthians|3|15|But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.
2 Corinthians|3|16|But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
2 Corinthians|3|17|is liberty.
2 Corinthians|3|18|
2 Corinthians|4|1|Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:
2 Corinthians|4|2|but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians|4|3|And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:
2 Corinthians|4|4|.
2 Corinthians|4|5|For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
2 Corinthians|4|6|Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians|4|7|But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;
2 Corinthians|4|8|pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;
2 Corinthians|4|9|pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;
2 Corinthians|4|10|always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.
2 Corinthians|4|11|For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
2 Corinthians|4|12|So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2 Corinthians|4|13|But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;
2 Corinthians|4|14|knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.
2 Corinthians|4|15|for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.
2 Corinthians|4|16|Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
2 Corinthians|4|17|For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;
2 Corinthians|4|18|
2 Corinthians|5|1|For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
2 Corinthians|5|2|For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:
2 Corinthians|5|3|if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians|5|4|For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
2 Corinthians|5|5|Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2 Corinthians|5|6|Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
2 Corinthians|5|7|(for we walk by faith, not by sight);
2 Corinthians|5|8|we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.
2 Corinthians|5|9|Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.
2 Corinthians|5|10|good or bad.
2 Corinthians|5|11|Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
2 Corinthians|5|12|as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.
2 Corinthians|5|13|For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.
2 Corinthians|5|14|For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;
2 Corinthians|5|15|and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.
2 Corinthians|5|16|no more.
2 Corinthians|5|17|a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.
2 Corinthians|5|18|But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;
2 Corinthians|5|19|to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
2 Corinthians|5|20|on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians|5|21|
2 Corinthians|6|1|we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain
2 Corinthians|6|2|behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):
2 Corinthians|6|3|giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;
2 Corinthians|6|4|but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
2 Corinthians|6|5|in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
2 Corinthians|6|6|in pureness, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
2 Corinthians|6|7|in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2 Corinthians|6|8|true;
2 Corinthians|6|9|well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
2 Corinthians|6|10|possessing all things.
2 Corinthians|6|11|Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
2 Corinthians|6|12|Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.
2 Corinthians|6|13|children), be ye also enlarged.
2 Corinthians|6|14|Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?
2 Corinthians|6|15|And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?
2 Corinthians|6|16|And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2 Corinthians|6|17|
2 Corinthians|6|18|
2 Corinthians|7|1|Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2 Corinthians|7|2|Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.
2 Corinthians|7|3|: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together.
2 Corinthians|7|4|Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
2 Corinthians|7|5|fears.
2 Corinthians|7|6|God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
2 Corinthians|7|7|and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.
2 Corinthians|7|8|(for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season),
2 Corinthians|7|9|I now rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.
2 Corinthians|7|10|which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
2 Corinthians|7|11|For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea what zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.
2 Corinthians|7|12|not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians|7|13|Therefore we have been comforted: And in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.
2 Corinthians|7|14|For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.
2 Corinthians|7|15|And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
2 Corinthians|7|16|
2 Corinthians|8|1|Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;
2 Corinthians|8|2|how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians|8|3|of their own accord,
2 Corinthians|8|4|beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:
2 Corinthians|8|5|, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
2 Corinthians|8|6|Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.
2 Corinthians|8|7|that ye abound in this grace also.
2 Corinthians|8|8|I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
2 Corinthians|8|9|For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.
2 Corinthians|8|10|judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.
2 Corinthians|8|11|the completion also out of your ability.
2 Corinthians|8|12|hath not.
2 Corinthians|8|13|ye distressed;
2 Corinthians|8|14|for your want; that there may be equality:
2 Corinthians|8|15|little had no lack.
2 Corinthians|8|16|But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
2 Corinthians|8|17|For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.
2 Corinthians|8|18|through all the churches;
2 Corinthians|8|19|our readiness:
2 Corinthians|8|20|this bounty which is ministered by us:
2 Corinthians|8|21|for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2 Corinthians|8|22|in you.
2 Corinthians|8|23|the glory of Christ.
2 Corinthians|8|24|
2 Corinthians|9|1|For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2 Corinthians|9|2|for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.
2 Corinthians|9|3|But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:
2 Corinthians|9|4|lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.
2 Corinthians|9|5|I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.
2 Corinthians|9|6|He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
2 Corinthians|9|7|according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
2 Corinthians|9|8|And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:
2 Corinthians|9|9|
2 Corinthians|9|10|And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:
2 Corinthians|9|11|ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians|9|12|For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;
2 Corinthians|9|13|contribution unto them and unto all;
2 Corinthians|9|14|while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.
2 Corinthians|9|15|
2 Corinthians|10|1|Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:
2 Corinthians|10|2|yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians|10|3|For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh
2 Corinthians|10|4|(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds),
2 Corinthians|10|5|casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
2 Corinthians|10|6|and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.
2 Corinthians|10|7|Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.
2 Corinthians|10|8|For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:
2 Corinthians|10|9|that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
2 Corinthians|10|10|For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.
2 Corinthians|10|11|also in deed when we are present.
2 Corinthians|10|12|For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
2 Corinthians|10|13|measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.
2 Corinthians|10|14|For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:
2 Corinthians|10|15|abundance,
2 Corinthians|10|16|not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.
2 Corinthians|10|17|But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2 Corinthians|10|18|
2 Corinthians|11|1|Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.
2 Corinthians|11|2|a pure virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|3|But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|4|.
2 Corinthians|11|5|For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2 Corinthians|11|6|manifest unto you in all things.
2 Corinthians|11|7|Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?
2 Corinthians|11|8|that I might minister unto you;
2 Corinthians|11|9|.
2 Corinthians|11|10|As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians|11|11|Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2 Corinthians|11|12|But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2 Corinthians|11|13|For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians|11|14|And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians|11|15|It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians|11|16|, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.
2 Corinthians|11|17|That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.
2 Corinthians|11|18|Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2 Corinthians|11|19|.
2 Corinthians|11|20|, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.
2 Corinthians|11|21|I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
2 Corinthians|11|22|Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2 Corinthians|11|23|Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.
2 Corinthians|11|24|save one.
2 Corinthians|11|25|Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;
2 Corinthians|11|26|perils among false brethren;
2 Corinthians|11|27|labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2 Corinthians|11|28|Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.
2 Corinthians|11|29|Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?
2 Corinthians|11|30|If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.
2 Corinthians|11|31|The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.
2 Corinthians|11|32|In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:
2 Corinthians|11|33|
2 Corinthians|12|1|I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians|12|2|I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
2 Corinthians|12|3|And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),
2 Corinthians|12|4|how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2 Corinthians|12|5|weaknesses.
2 Corinthians|12|6|, or heareth from me.
2 Corinthians|12|7|And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.
2 Corinthians|12|8|Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
2 Corinthians|12|9|power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians|12|10|Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2 Corinthians|12|11|I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
2 Corinthians|12|12|Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.
2 Corinthians|12|13|that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.
2 Corinthians|12|14|Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2 Corinthians|12|15|And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
2 Corinthians|12|16|But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2 Corinthians|12|17|Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?
2 Corinthians|12|18|not in the same steps?
2 Corinthians|12|19|for your edifying.
2 Corinthians|12|20|strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;
2 Corinthians|12|21|
2 Corinthians|13|1|This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word established.
2 Corinthians|13|2|I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;
2 Corinthians|13|3|seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:
2 Corinthians|13|4|for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.
2 Corinthians|13|5|Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|6|But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|7|Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.
2 Corinthians|13|8|For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2 Corinthians|13|9|For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
2 Corinthians|13|10|For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.
2 Corinthians|13|11|Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
2 Corinthians|13|12|Salute one another with a holy kiss.
2 Corinthians|13|13|All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians|13|14|

Titus|1|1|Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
Titus|1|2|in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
Titus|1|3|but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus|1|4|to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
Titus|1|5|For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
Titus|1|6|if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus|1|7|For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
Titus|1|8|but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
Titus|1|9|holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
Titus|1|10|For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
Titus|1|11|whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
Titus|1|12|One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
Titus|1|13|This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus|1|14|not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus|1|15|To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus|1|16|
Titus|2|1|But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
Titus|2|2|that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
Titus|2|3|that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
Titus|2|4|that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus|2|5|sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
Titus|2|6|the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
Titus|2|7|uncorruptness, gravity,
Titus|2|8|sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
Titus|2|9|in all things; not gainsaying;
Titus|2|10|not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus|2|11|For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus|2|12|instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
Titus|2|13|looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus|2|14|who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
Titus|2|15|
Titus|3|1|Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
Titus|3|2|to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
Titus|3|3|For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus|3|4|But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
Titus|3|5|in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus|3|6|which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus|3|7|that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus|3|8|Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
Titus|3|9|but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus|3|10|A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
Titus|3|11|knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
Titus|3|12|When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
Titus|3|13|Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus|3|14|also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus|3|15|
Habakkuk|1|1|The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
Habakkuk|1|2|O Jehovah, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.
Habakkuk|1|3|Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.
Habakkuk|1|4|Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.
Habakkuk|1|5|Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.
Habakkuk|1|6|For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.
Habakkuk|1|7|They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
Habakkuk|1|8|Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.
Habakkuk|1|9|They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.
Habakkuk|1|10|Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.
Habakkuk|1|11|he whose might is his god.
Habakkuk|1|12|Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.
Habakkuk|1|13|Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;
Habakkuk|1|14|and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
Habakkuk|1|15|He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.
Habakkuk|1|16|Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.
Habakkuk|1|17|
Habakkuk|2|1|I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will look forth to see what he will speak with me, and what I shall answer concerning my complaint.
Habakkuk|2|2|And Jehovah answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.
Habakkuk|2|3|For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hasteth toward the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not delay.
Habakkuk|2|4|Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith.
Habakkuk|2|5|Yea, moreover, wine is treacherous, a haughty man, that keepeth not at home; who enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and he is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all peoples.
Habakkuk|2|6|Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and that ladeth himself with pledges!
Habakkuk|2|7|Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booty unto them?
Habakkuk|2|8|Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder thee, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|9|Woe to him that getteth an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!
Habakkuk|2|10|Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many peoples, and hast sinned against thy soul.
Habakkuk|2|11|For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
Habakkuk|2|12|Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and establisheth a city by iniquity!
Habakkuk|2|13|Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?
Habakkuk|2|14|For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
Habakkuk|2|15|that addest thy venom, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
Habakkuk|2|16|Thou art filled with shame, and not glory: drink thou also, and be as one uncircumcised; the cup of Jehovah’s right hand shall come round unto thee, and foul shame shall be upon thy glory.
Habakkuk|2|17|For the violence done to Lebanon shall cover thee, and the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all that dwell therein.
Habakkuk|2|18|What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he that fashioneth its form trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
Habakkuk|2|19|Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

Jonah|1|1|Now the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
Jonah|1|2|Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
Jonah|1|3|But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah.
Jonah|1|4|But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
Jonah|1|5|Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
Jonah|1|6|So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
Jonah|1|7|And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
Jonah|1|8|Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
Jonah|1|9|And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Jehovah, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.
Jonah|1|10|Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
Jonah|1|11|Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
Jonah|1|12|And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
Jonah|1|13|Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
Jonah|1|14|Wherefore they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We beseech thee, O Jehovah, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O Jehovah, hast done as it pleased thee.
Jonah|1|15|So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
Jonah|1|16|Then the men feared Jehovah exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah, and made vows.
Jonah|1|17|
Jonah|2|1|Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fish’s belly.
Jonah|2|2|thou heardest my voice.
Jonah|2|3|For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
Jonah|2|4|And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|5|The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.
Jonah|2|6|upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
Jonah|2|7|When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.
Jonah|2|8|They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.
Jonah|2|9|But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.
Jonah|2|10|
Jonah|3|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the second time, saying,
Jonah|3|2|Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
Jonah|3|3|So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of Jehovah. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.
Jonah|3|4|And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
Jonah|3|5|And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
Jonah|3|6|And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
Jonah|3|7|And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water;
Jonah|3|8|but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands.
Jonah|3|9|Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?
Jonah|3|10|
Jonah|4|1|But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
Jonah|4|2|And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, I pray thee, O Jehovah, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
Jonah|4|3|Therefore now, O Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|4|And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?
Jonah|4|5|Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.
Jonah|4|6|And Jehovah God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.
Jonah|4|7|But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
Jonah|4|8|And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
Jonah|4|9|And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
Jonah|4|10|And Jehovah said, Thou hast had regard for the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:
Jonah|4|11|
1 Samuel|1|1|Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
1 Samuel|1|2|and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1 Samuel|1|3|And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests unto Jehovah, were there.
1 Samuel|1|4|And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
1 Samuel|1|5|but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|6|And her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
1 Samuel|1|7|he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1 Samuel|1|8|
1 Samuel|1|9|So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|10|And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore.
1 Samuel|1|11|
1 Samuel|1|12|And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
1 Samuel|1|13|Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1 Samuel|1|14|And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
1 Samuel|1|15|And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|16|Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.
1 Samuel|1|17|Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1 Samuel|1|18|
1 Samuel|1|19|And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
1 Samuel|1|20|
1 Samuel|1|21|And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto Jehovah the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1 Samuel|1|22|until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
1 Samuel|1|23|And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only Jehovah establish his word. So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.
1 Samuel|1|24|And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of Jehovah in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1 Samuel|1|25|And they slew the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel|1|26|And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|1|27|For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him:

1 Samuel|2|13|And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
1 Samuel|2|14|and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
1 Samuel|2|15|Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
1 Samuel|2|16|And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
1 Samuel|2|17|
1 Samuel|2|18|But Samuel ministered before Jehovah, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
1 Samuel|2|19|Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel|2|20|And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Jehovah. And they went unto their own home.
1 Samuel|2|21|
1 Samuel|2|22|Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
1 Samuel|2|23|And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
1 Samuel|2|24|Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah’s people to transgress.
1 Samuel|2|25|If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because Jehovah was minded to slay them.
1 Samuel|2|26|
1 Samuel|2|27|to Pharaoh’s house?
1 Samuel|2|28|and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
1 Samuel|2|29|habitation, and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1 Samuel|2|30|Therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now Jehovah saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
1 Samuel|2|31|Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
1 Samuel|2|32|shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
1 Samuel|2|33|to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart; and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
1 Samuel|2|34|And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
1 Samuel|2|35|And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
1 Samuel|2|36|
1 Samuel|3|1|And the child Samuel ministered unto Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
1 Samuel|3|2|And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),
1 Samuel|3|3|, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was;
1 Samuel|3|4|that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|5|And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1 Samuel|3|6|And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
1 Samuel|3|7|Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him.
1 Samuel|3|8|And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child.
1 Samuel|3|9|
1 Samuel|3|10|And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
1 Samuel|3|11|And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
1 Samuel|3|12|In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end.
1 Samuel|3|13|For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
1 Samuel|3|14|
1 Samuel|3|15|And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
1 Samuel|3|16|Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
1 Samuel|3|17|hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee.
1 Samuel|3|18|
1 Samuel|3|19|And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
1 Samuel|3|20|And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|3|21|
1 Samuel|4|1|Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
1 Samuel|4|2|And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1 Samuel|4|3|And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh unto us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
1 Samuel|4|4|
1 Samuel|4|5|And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
1 Samuel|4|6|And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah was come into the camp.
1 Samuel|4|7|And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
1 Samuel|4|8|Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.
1 Samuel|4|9|Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
1 Samuel|4|10|And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
1 Samuel|4|11|
1 Samuel|4|12|And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
1 Samuel|4|13|And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
1 Samuel|4|14|And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli.
1 Samuel|4|15|Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.
1 Samuel|4|16|And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, How went the matter, my son?
1 Samuel|4|17|And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
1 Samuel|4|18|
1 Samuel|4|19|And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came upon her.
1 Samuel|4|20|And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
1 Samuel|4|21|And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
1 Samuel|4|22|
1 Samuel|5|1|Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
1 Samuel|5|2|And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
1 Samuel|5|3|And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
1 Samuel|5|4|Dagon was left to him.
1 Samuel|5|5|
1 Samuel|5|6|But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.
1 Samuel|5|7|And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
1 Samuel|5|8|.
1 Samuel|5|9|And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.
1 Samuel|5|10|So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
1 Samuel|5|11|They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that is slay us not, and our people. For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
1 Samuel|5|12|
1 Samuel|6|1|And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1 Samuel|6|2|And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? show us wherewith we shall sent it to its place.
1 Samuel|6|3|And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
1 Samuel|6|4|the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
1 Samuel|6|5|Wherefore ye shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
1 Samuel|6|6|Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
1 Samuel|6|7|Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
1 Samuel|6|8|and take the ark of Jehovah, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.
1 Samuel|6|9|
1 Samuel|6|10|And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;
1 Samuel|6|11|and they put the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
1 Samuel|6|12|And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
1 Samuel|6|13|And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
1 Samuel|6|14|And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|6|15|And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|6|16|
1 Samuel|6|17|And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering unto Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
1 Samuel|6|18|
1 Samuel|6|19|fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter.
1 Samuel|6|20|And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
1 Samuel|6|21|
1 Samuel|7|1|And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|2|And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|3|And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto Jehovah with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto Jehovah, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|4|
1 Samuel|7|5|And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|7|6|And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
1 Samuel|7|7|And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|8|And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|7|9|And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto Jehovah: and Samuel cried unto Jehovah for Israel; and Jehovah answered him.
1 Samuel|7|10|And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.
1 Samuel|7|11|
1 Samuel|7|12|Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us.
1 Samuel|7|13|So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
1 Samuel|7|14|
1 Samuel|7|15|And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1 Samuel|7|16|And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.
1 Samuel|7|17|
1 Samuel|8|1|And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1 Samuel|8|2|Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
1 Samuel|8|3|
1 Samuel|8|4|Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah;
1 Samuel|8|5|and they said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
1 Samuel|8|6|But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.
1 Samuel|8|7|And Jehovah said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.
1 Samuel|8|8|According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
1 Samuel|8|9|
1 Samuel|8|10|And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah unto the people that asked of him a king.
1 Samuel|8|11|And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots;
1 Samuel|8|12|to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
1 Samuel|8|13|And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
1 Samuel|8|14|And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel|8|15|And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1 Samuel|8|16|And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
1 Samuel|8|17|He will take the tenth of your flocks: and ye shall be his servants.
1 Samuel|8|18|
1 Samuel|8|19|But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay: but we will have a king over us,
1 Samuel|8|20|that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
1 Samuel|8|21|And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|8|22|
1 Samuel|9|1|Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.
1 Samuel|9|2|And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a young man and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1 Samuel|9|3|And the asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
1 Samuel|9|4|
1 Samuel|9|5|When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.
1 Samuel|9|6|And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
1 Samuel|9|7|Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
1 Samuel|9|8|And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
1 Samuel|9|9|(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)
1 Samuel|9|10|
1 Samuel|9|11|As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?
1 Samuel|9|12|before thee: make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place:
1 Samuel|9|13|afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find him.
1 Samuel|9|14|
1 Samuel|9|15|Now Jehovah had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,
1 Samuel|9|16|To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
1 Samuel|9|17|And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said unto him, Behold, the man of whom I spake to thee! this same shall have authority over my people.
1 Samuel|9|18|Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.
1 Samuel|9|19|And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day: and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
1 Samuel|9|20|And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for thee, and for all thy father’s house?
1 Samuel|9|21|
1 Samuel|9|22|And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.
1 Samuel|9|23|And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.
1 Samuel|9|24|
1 Samuel|9|25|And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul upon the housetop.
1 Samuel|9|26|And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1 Samuel|9|27|
1 Samuel|10|1|Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not that Jehovah hath anointed thee to be prince over his inheritance?
1 Samuel|10|2|When thou art departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found; and, lo, thy father hath left off caring for the asses, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1 Samuel|10|3|Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet thee there three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
1 Samuel|10|4|and they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, which thou shalt receive of their hand.
1 Samuel|10|5|After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:
1 Samuel|10|6|and the Spirit of Jehovah will come mightily upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
1 Samuel|10|7|And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.
1 Samuel|10|8|
1 Samuel|10|9|And it was so, that, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
1 Samuel|10|10|And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.
1 Samuel|10|11|And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|12|And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1 Samuel|10|13|
1 Samuel|10|14|And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.
1 Samuel|10|15|And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
1 Samuel|10|16|
1 Samuel|10|17|And Samuel called the people together unto Jehovah to Mizpah;
1 Samuel|10|18|and he said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
1 Samuel|10|19|, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
1 Samuel|10|20|So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1 Samuel|10|21|And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.
1 Samuel|10|22|Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
1 Samuel|10|23|And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1 Samuel|10|24|
1 Samuel|10|25|Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
1 Samuel|10|26|And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.
1 Samuel|10|27|
1 Samuel|11|1|Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|11|2|And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1 Samuel|11|3|And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to thee.
1 Samuel|11|4|Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|11|5|
1 Samuel|11|6|And the Spirit of God came mightily upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1 Samuel|11|7|And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
1 Samuel|11|8|And he numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1 Samuel|11|9|And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
1 Samuel|11|10|Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
1 Samuel|11|11|
1 Samuel|11|12|And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1 Samuel|11|13|
1 Samuel|11|14|Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
1 Samuel|11|15|
1 Samuel|12|1|And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|2|And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth unto this day.
1 Samuel|12|3|Here I am: witness against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
1 Samuel|12|4|And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man’s hand.
1 Samuel|12|5|
1 Samuel|12|6|And Samuel said unto the people, It is Jehovah that appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|12|7|Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|8|When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
1 Samuel|12|9|But they forgat Jehovah their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
1 Samuel|12|10|And they cried unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
1 Samuel|12|11|And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and ye dwelt in safety.
1 Samuel|12|12|And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.
1 Samuel|12|13|Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have asked for: and, behold, Jehovah hath set a king over you.
1 Samuel|12|14|:
1 Samuel|12|15|but if ye will not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as it was against your fathers.
1 Samuel|12|16|Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
1 Samuel|12|17|Is it not wheat harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, that he may send thunder and rain; and ye shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah, in asking you a king.
1 Samuel|12|18|
1 Samuel|12|19|evil, to ask us a king.
1 Samuel|12|20|And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not; ye have indeed done all this evil; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart:
1 Samuel|12|21|after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
1 Samuel|12|22|For Jehovah will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it hath pleased Jehovah to make you a people unto himself.
1 Samuel|12|23|Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
1 Samuel|12|24|Only fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he hath done for you.
1 Samuel|12|25|
1 Samuel|13|1|years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1 Samuel|13|2|Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
1 Samuel|13|3|And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1 Samuel|13|4|
1 Samuel|13|5|And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth-aven.
1 Samuel|13|6|When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
1 Samuel|13|7|
1 Samuel|13|8|: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
1 Samuel|13|9|And Saul said, Bring hither the burnt-offering to me, and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|10|And it came to pass that, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
1 Samuel|13|11|And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;
1 Samuel|13|12|therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of Jehovah: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.
1 Samuel|13|13|And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
1 Samuel|13|14|But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people, because thou hast not kept that which Jehovah commanded thee.
1 Samuel|13|15|And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1 Samuel|13|16|And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1 Samuel|13|17|And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
1 Samuel|13|18|
1 Samuel|13|19|Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
1 Samuel|13|20|but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock;
1 Samuel|13|21|yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
1 Samuel|13|22|So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
1 Samuel|13|23|
1 Samuel|14|1|Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on yonder side. But he told not his father.
1 Samuel|14|2|And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1 Samuel|14|3|and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
1 Samuel|14|4|And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
1 Samuel|14|5|
1 Samuel|14|6|And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
1 Samuel|14|7|And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee, behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
1 Samuel|14|8|Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto the men, and we will disclose ourselves unto them.
1 Samuel|14|9|If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
1 Samuel|14|10|But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up; for Jehovah hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign unto us.
1 Samuel|14|11|And both of them disclosed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
1 Samuel|14|12|And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
1 Samuel|14|13|And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer slew them after him.
1 Samuel|14|14|And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land.
1 Samuel|14|15|
1 Samuel|14|16|and thither.
1 Samuel|14|17|Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.
1 Samuel|14|18|at that time with the children of Israel.
1 Samuel|14|19|And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
1 Samuel|14|20|a very great discomfiture.
1 Samuel|14|21|to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
1 Samuel|14|22|Likewise all the men of Israel that had hid themselves in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
1 Samuel|14|23|
1 Samuel|14|24|And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
1 Samuel|14|25|And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey upon the ground.
1 Samuel|14|26|And when the people were come unto the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.
1 Samuel|14|27|But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
1 Samuel|14|28|Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day. And the people were faint.
1 Samuel|14|29|Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
1 Samuel|14|30|
1 Samuel|14|31|And they smote of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint;
1 Samuel|14|32|and the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people did eat them with the blood.
1 Samuel|14|33|Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, ye have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone unto me this day.
1 Samuel|14|34|And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
1 Samuel|14|35|
1 Samuel|14|36|And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
1 Samuel|14|37|And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
1 Samuel|14|38|And Saul said, Draw nigh hither, all ye chiefs of the people; and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
1 Samuel|14|39|For, as Jehovah liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
1 Samuel|14|40|Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
1 Samuel|14|41|; but the people escaped.
1 Samuel|14|42|
1 Samuel|14|43|Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and, lo, I must die.
1 Samuel|14|44|And Saul said, God do so and more also; for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
1 Samuel|14|45|And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
1 Samuel|14|46|Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
1 Samuel|14|47|to the worse.
1 Samuel|14|48|
1 Samuel|14|49|Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
1 Samuel|14|50|and the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
1 Samuel|14|51|
1 Samuel|14|52|
1 Samuel|15|1|And Samuel said unto Saul, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|2|Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
1 Samuel|15|3|
1 Samuel|15|4|And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1 Samuel|15|5|And Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1 Samuel|15|6|And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel|15|7|And Saul smote the Amalekites, from Havilah as thou goest to Shur, that is before Egypt.
1 Samuel|15|8|And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel|15|9|
1 Samuel|15|10|Then came the word of Jehovah unto Samuel, saying,
1 Samuel|15|11|It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And Samuel was wroth; and he cried unto Jehovah all night.
1 Samuel|15|12|And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
1 Samuel|15|13|And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah: I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|14|And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1 Samuel|15|15|And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
1 Samuel|15|16|
1 Samuel|15|17|And Samuel said, Though thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel;
1 Samuel|15|18|and Jehovah sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
1 Samuel|15|19|Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of Jehovah, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah?
1 Samuel|15|20|And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
1 Samuel|15|21|But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
1 Samuel|15|22|And Samuel said, Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
1 Samuel|15|23|
1 Samuel|15|24|And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
1 Samuel|15|25|Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.
1 Samuel|15|26|And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
1 Samuel|15|27|laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it rent.
1 Samuel|15|28|And Samuel said unto him, Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.
1 Samuel|15|29|And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.
1 Samuel|15|30|Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
1 Samuel|15|31|
1 Samuel|15|32|Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
1 Samuel|15|33|
1 Samuel|15|34|Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel|15|35|
1 Samuel|16|1|And Jehovah said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
1 Samuel|16|2|And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.
1 Samuel|16|3|And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
1 Samuel|16|4|And Samuel did that which Jehovah spake, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
1 Samuel|16|5|
1 Samuel|16|6|And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah’s anointed is before him.
1 Samuel|16|7|not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looketh on the heart.
1 Samuel|16|8|Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.
1 Samuel|16|9|Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this.
1 Samuel|16|10|And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these.
1 Samuel|16|11|And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.
1 Samuel|16|12|And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
1 Samuel|16|13|Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of Jehovah came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel|16|14|Now the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
1 Samuel|16|15|And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
1 Samuel|16|16|Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
1 Samuel|16|17|And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
1 Samuel|16|18|Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Jehovah is with him.
1 Samuel|16|19|Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
1 Samuel|16|20|with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
1 Samuel|16|21|And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.
1 Samuel|16|22|And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
1 Samuel|16|23|
1 Samuel|17|1|Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
1 Samuel|17|2|And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the vale of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
1 Samuel|17|3|And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
1 Samuel|17|4|And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
1 Samuel|17|5|And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
1 Samuel|17|6|And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
1 Samuel|17|7|six hundred shekels of iron: and his shield-bearer went before him.
1 Samuel|17|8|And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
1 Samuel|17|9|If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
1 Samuel|17|10|And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
1 Samuel|17|11|
1 Samuel|17|12|among men.
1 Samuel|17|13|And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1 Samuel|17|14|And David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.
1 Samuel|17|15|Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Beth-lehem.
1 Samuel|17|16|
1 Samuel|17|17|quickly to the camp to thy brethren;
1 Samuel|17|18|and bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
1 Samuel|17|19|
1 Samuel|17|20|And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
1 Samuel|17|21|And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
1 Samuel|17|22|And David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
1 Samuel|17|23|And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.
1 Samuel|17|24|And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
1 Samuel|17|25|And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.
1 Samuel|17|26|And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1 Samuel|17|27|
1 Samuel|17|28|And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why art thou come down? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
1 Samuel|17|29|And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1 Samuel|17|30|
1 Samuel|17|31|And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
1 Samuel|17|32|And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|33|And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
1 Samuel|17|34|And David said unto Saul, Thy servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,
1 Samuel|17|35|I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
1 Samuel|17|36|Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
1 Samuel|17|37|And David said, Jehovah that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
1 Samuel|17|38|And Saul clad David with his apparel, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel|17|39|And David girded his sword upon his apparel, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.
1 Samuel|17|40|
1 Samuel|17|41|And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.
1 Samuel|17|42|And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.
1 Samuel|17|43|And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1 Samuel|17|44|And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.
1 Samuel|17|45|Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
1 Samuel|17|46|This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
1 Samuel|17|47|and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah’s, and he will give you into our hand.
1 Samuel|17|48|And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
1 Samuel|17|49|
1 Samuel|17|50|So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1 Samuel|17|51|Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
1 Samuel|17|52|And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
1 Samuel|17|53|And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
1 Samuel|17|54|
1 Samuel|17|55|And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
1 Samuel|17|56|And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1 Samuel|17|57|And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1 Samuel|17|58|
1 Samuel|18|1|And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|2|And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.
1 Samuel|18|3|Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel|18|4|And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
1 Samuel|18|5|behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
1 Samuel|18|6|And it came to pass as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music.
1 Samuel|18|7|
1 Samuel|18|8|And Saul was very wroth, and this saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1 Samuel|18|9|
1 Samuel|18|10|And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as he did day by day. And Saul had his spear in his hand;
1 Samuel|18|11|and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1 Samuel|18|12|And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and was departed from Saul.
1 Samuel|18|13|Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel|18|14|And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.
1 Samuel|18|15|And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
1 Samuel|18|16|
1 Samuel|18|17|And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
1 Samuel|18|18|my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
1 Samuel|18|19|But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
1 Samuel|18|20|And Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1 Samuel|18|21|
1 Samuel|18|22|, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son-in-law.
1 Samuel|18|23|And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
1 Samuel|18|24|And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.
1 Samuel|18|25|And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|18|26|And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. And the days were not expired;
1 Samuel|18|27|and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.
1 Samuel|18|28|And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
1 Samuel|18|29|
1 Samuel|18|30|
1 Samuel|19|1|And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should slay David. But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David.
1 Samuel|19|2|And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to slay thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself in the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
1 Samuel|19|3|and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and if I see aught, I will tell thee.
1 Samuel|19|4|And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:
1 Samuel|19|5|for he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and Jehovah wrought a great victory for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice; wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
1 Samuel|19|6|And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death.
1 Samuel|19|7|
1 Samuel|19|8|And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled before him.
1 Samuel|19|9|And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.
1 Samuel|19|10|And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the spear into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1 Samuel|19|11|And Saul sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.
1 Samuel|19|12|So Michal let David down through the window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
1 Samuel|19|13|at the head thereof, and covered it with the clothes.
1 Samuel|19|14|And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1 Samuel|19|15|And Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
1 Samuel|19|16|at the head thereof.
1 Samuel|19|17|
1 Samuel|19|18|Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1 Samuel|19|19|And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|20|And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel|19|21|And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
1 Samuel|19|22|Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|23|And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1 Samuel|19|24|
1 Samuel|20|1|And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
1 Samuel|20|2|And he said unto him, Far from it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father doeth nothing either great or small, but that he discloseth it unto me; and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
1 Samuel|20|3|And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father knoweth well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
1 Samuel|20|4|Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
1 Samuel|20|5|And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.
1 Samuel|20|6|If thy father miss me at all, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Beth-lehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
1 Samuel|20|7|If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be wroth, then know that evil is determined by him.
1 Samuel|20|8|Therefore deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee: but if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
1 Samuel|20|9|And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
1 Samuel|20|10|Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me if perchance thy father answer thee roughly?
1 Samuel|20|11|
1 Samuel|20|12|the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?
1 Samuel|20|13|Jehovah do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and Jehovah be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
1 Samuel|20|14|And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Jehovah, that I die not;
1 Samuel|20|15|but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
1 Samuel|20|16|
1 Samuel|20|17|And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1 Samuel|20|18|Then Jonathan said unto him, To-morrow is the new moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
1 Samuel|20|19|And when thou hast stayed three days, thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
1 Samuel|20|20|And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.
1 Samuel|20|21|, Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as Jehovah liveth.
1 Samuel|20|22|But if I say thus unto the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for Jehovah hath sent thee away.
1 Samuel|20|23|
1 Samuel|20|24|So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.
1 Samuel|20|25|And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.
1 Samuel|20|26|Nevertheless Saul spake not anything that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
1 Samuel|20|27|, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
1 Samuel|20|28|And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:
1 Samuel|20|29|
1 Samuel|20|30|Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?
1 Samuel|20|31|For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
1 Samuel|20|32|And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore should he be put to death? what hath he done?
1 Samuel|20|33|And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.
1 Samuel|20|34|
1 Samuel|20|35|And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
1 Samuel|20|36|And he said unto his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
1 Samuel|20|37|And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
1 Samuel|20|38|And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
1 Samuel|20|39|But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1 Samuel|20|40|And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
1 Samuel|20|41|toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
1 Samuel|20|42|
1 Samuel|21|1|Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
1 Samuel|21|2|And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know anything of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.
1 Samuel|21|3|Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present.
1 Samuel|21|4|And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.
1 Samuel|21|5|And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then to-day shall their vessels be holy?
1 Samuel|21|6|
1 Samuel|21|7|Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chiefest of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul.
1 Samuel|21|8|And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.
1 Samuel|21|9|
1 Samuel|21|10|And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel|21|11|
1 Samuel|21|12|And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
1 Samuel|21|13|And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
1 Samuel|21|14|Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad; wherefore then have ye brought him to me?
1 Samuel|21|15|
1 Samuel|22|1|David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.
1 Samuel|22|2|
1 Samuel|22|3|with you, till I know what God will do for me.
1 Samuel|22|4|And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
1 Samuel|22|5|
1 Samuel|22|6|And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him: now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.
1 Samuel|22|7|And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
1 Samuel|22|8|that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that discloseth to me when my son maketh a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or discloseth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1 Samuel|22|9|Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
1 Samuel|22|10|
1 Samuel|22|11|Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
1 Samuel|22|12|And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
1 Samuel|22|13|And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1 Samuel|22|14|Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into thy council, and is honorable in thy house?
1 Samuel|22|15|Have I to-day begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute anything unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for thy servant knoweth nothing of all this, less or more.
1 Samuel|22|16|And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.
1 Samuel|22|17|And the king said unto the guard that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of Jehovah; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
1 Samuel|22|18|And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
1 Samuel|22|19|
1 Samuel|22|20|And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
1 Samuel|22|21|And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Jehovah’s priests.
1 Samuel|22|22|of all the persons of thy father’s house.
1 Samuel|22|23|
1 Samuel|23|1|And they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing-floors.
1 Samuel|23|2|Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And Jehovah said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|3|And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1 Samuel|23|4|Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
1 Samuel|23|5|And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and slew them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1 Samuel|23|6|
1 Samuel|23|7|And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
1 Samuel|23|8|And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1 Samuel|23|9|And David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
1 Samuel|23|10|Then said David, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
1 Samuel|23|11|Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Jehovah, the God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
1 Samuel|23|12|Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up.
1 Samuel|23|13|Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
1 Samuel|23|14|
1 Samuel|23|15|And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
1 Samuel|23|16|And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
1 Samuel|23|17|And he said unto him, Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
1 Samuel|23|18|
1 Samuel|23|19|Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
1 Samuel|23|20|Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s hand.
1 Samuel|23|21|And Saul said, Blessed be ye of Jehovah; for ye have had compassion on me.
1 Samuel|23|22|who hath seen him there; for it is told me that he dealeth very subtly.
1 Samuel|23|23|
1 Samuel|23|24|And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
1 Samuel|23|25|, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1 Samuel|23|26|And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
1 Samuel|23|27|But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land.
1 Samuel|23|28|So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.
1 Samuel|23|29|
1 Samuel|24|1|And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
1 Samuel|24|2|Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1 Samuel|24|3|And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
1 Samuel|24|4|And the men of David said unto him, Behold, the day of which Jehovah said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thy hand, and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.
1 Samuel|24|5|And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
1 Samuel|24|6|And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|7|
1 Samuel|24|8|David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.
1 Samuel|24|9|And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearkenest thou to men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
1 Samuel|24|10|spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|24|11|Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee, though thou huntest after my life to take it.
1 Samuel|24|12|Jehovah judge between me and thee, and Jehovah avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|13|As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1 Samuel|24|14|After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
1 Samuel|24|15|
1 Samuel|24|16|And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
1 Samuel|24|17|And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.
1 Samuel|24|18|And thou hast declared this day how that thou hast dealt well with me, forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand, thou killedst me not.
1 Samuel|24|19|For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that which thou hast done unto me this day.
1 Samuel|24|20|And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
1 Samuel|24|21|Swear now therefore unto me by Jehovah, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.
1 Samuel|24|22|
1 Samuel|25|1|
1 Samuel|25|2|And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|3|Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
1 Samuel|25|4|And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel|25|5|And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
1 Samuel|25|6|, Peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.
1 Samuel|25|7|And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: thy shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there aught missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
1 Samuel|25|8|
1 Samuel|25|9|And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
1 Samuel|25|10|And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master.
1 Samuel|25|11|Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?
1 Samuel|25|12|So David’s young men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to all these words.
1 Samuel|25|13|
1 Samuel|25|14|But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
1 Samuel|25|15|But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:
1 Samuel|25|16|they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
1 Samuel|25|17|
1 Samuel|25|18|Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
1 Samuel|25|19|And she said unto her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|20|And it was so, as she rode on her ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.
1 Samuel|25|21|Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.
1 Samuel|25|22|
1 Samuel|25|23|And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and alighted from her ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
1 Samuel|25|24|And she fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy handmaid.
1 Samuel|25|25|Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
1 Samuel|25|26|Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
1 Samuel|25|27|And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the young men that follow my lord.
1 Samuel|25|28|Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battles of Jehovah; and evil shall not be found in thee all thy days.
1 Samuel|25|29|And though men be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
1 Samuel|25|30|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee prince over Israel,
1 Samuel|25|31|
1 Samuel|25|32|And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:
1 Samuel|25|33|and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
1 Samuel|25|34|For in very deed, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one man-child.
1 Samuel|25|35|
1 Samuel|25|36|And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1 Samuel|25|37|And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1 Samuel|25|38|
1 Samuel|25|39|And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Jehovah, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back his servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal hath Jehovah returned upon his own head. And David sent and spake concerning Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|40|And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
1 Samuel|25|41|And she arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1 Samuel|25|42|
1 Samuel|25|43|David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them his wives.
1 Samuel|25|44|
1 Samuel|26|1|And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
1 Samuel|26|2|Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1 Samuel|26|3|And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
1 Samuel|26|4|David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come of a certainty.
1 Samuel|26|5|
1 Samuel|26|6|Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1 Samuel|26|7|So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the people lay round about him.
1 Samuel|26|8|Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered up thine enemy into thy hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not smite him the second time.
1 Samuel|26|9|And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can put forth his hand against Jehovah’s anointed, and be guiltless?
1 Samuel|26|10|And David said, As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.
1 Samuel|26|11|Jehovah forbid that I should put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed: but now take, I pray thee, the spear that is at his head, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
1 Samuel|26|12|
1 Samuel|26|13|Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
1 Samuel|26|14|and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
1 Samuel|26|15|man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
1 Samuel|26|16|
1 Samuel|26|17|And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1 Samuel|26|18|And he said, Wherefore doth my lord pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
1 Samuel|26|19|Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it be Jehovah that hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if it be the children of men, cursed be they before Jehovah: for they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
1 Samuel|26|20|
1 Samuel|26|21|Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David; for I will no more do thee harm, because my life was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
1 Samuel|26|22|And David answered and said, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of the young men come over and fetch it.
1 Samuel|26|23|And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; forasmuch as Jehovah delivered thee into my hand to-day, and I would not put forth my hand against Jehovah’s anointed.
1 Samuel|26|24|And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Jehovah, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
1 Samuel|26|25|
1 Samuel|27|1|And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
1 Samuel|27|2|And David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men that were with him, unto Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1 Samuel|27|3|And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
1 Samuel|27|4|
1 Samuel|27|5|And David said unto Achish, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
1 Samuel|27|6|Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
1 Samuel|27|7|
1 Samuel|27|8|were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel|27|9|And David smote the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel; and he returned, and came to Achish.
1 Samuel|27|10|And Achish said, Against whom have ye made a raid to-day? And David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
1 Samuel|27|11|And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David, and so hath been his manner all the while he hath dwelt in the country of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|27|12|
1 Samuel|28|1|And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their hosts together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me in the host, thou and thy men.
1 Samuel|28|2|
1 Samuel|28|3|Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1 Samuel|28|4|And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
1 Samuel|28|5|And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
1 Samuel|28|6|And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
1 Samuel|28|7|
1 Samuel|28|8|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomsoever I shall name unto thee.
1 Samuel|28|9|And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1 Samuel|28|10|And Saul sware to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
1 Samuel|28|11|Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1 Samuel|28|12|And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
1 Samuel|28|13|And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
1 Samuel|28|14|
1 Samuel|28|15|And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
1 Samuel|28|16|And Samuel said, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine adversary?
1 Samuel|28|17|And Jehovah hath done unto thee, as he spake by me: and Jehovah hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.
1 Samuel|28|18|Because thou obeyedst not the voice of Jehovah, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath Jehovah done this thing unto thee this day.
1 Samuel|28|19|
1 Samuel|28|20|Then Saul fell straightway his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
1 Samuel|28|21|And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
1 Samuel|28|22|Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
1 Samuel|28|23|But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1 Samuel|28|24|And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
1 Samuel|28|25|
1 Samuel|29|1|Now the Philistines gathered together all their hosts to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.
1 Samuel|29|2|And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.
1 Samuel|29|3|unto this day?
1 Samuel|29|4|reconcile himself unto his lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?
1 Samuel|29|5|
1 Samuel|29|6|Then Achish called David, and said unto him, As Jehovah liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
1 Samuel|29|7|Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
1 Samuel|29|8|And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1 Samuel|29|9|And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1 Samuel|29|10|Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and as soon as ye are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
1 Samuel|29|11|
1 Samuel|30|1|And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid upon the South, and upon Ziklag, and had smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
1 Samuel|30|2|that were therein, both small and great: they slew not any, but carried them off, and went their way.
1 Samuel|30|3|And when David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive.
1 Samuel|30|4|Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
1 Samuel|30|5|And David’s two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
1 Samuel|30|6|
1 Samuel|30|7|And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
1 Samuel|30|8|.
1 Samuel|30|9|So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
1 Samuel|30|10|
1 Samuel|30|11|And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they gave him water to drink.
1 Samuel|30|12|And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
1 Samuel|30|13|And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
1 Samuel|30|14|We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1 Samuel|30|15|
1 Samuel|30|16|And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
1 Samuel|30|17|And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels and fled.
1 Samuel|30|18|And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel|30|19|And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.
1 Samuel|30|20|
1 Samuel|30|21|And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
1 Samuel|30|22|Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.
1 Samuel|30|23|Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
1 Samuel|30|24|And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as his share is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his share be that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall share alike.
1 Samuel|30|25|
1 Samuel|30|26|And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:
1 Samuel|30|27|To them that were in Beth-el, and to them that were in Ramoth of the South, and to them that were in Jattir,
1 Samuel|30|28|and to them that were in Aroer, and to them that were in Siphmoth, and to them that were in Eshtemoa,
1 Samuel|30|29|and to them that were in Racal, and to them that were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them that were in the cities of the Kenites,
1 Samuel|30|30|and to them that were in Hormah, and to them that were in Bor-ashan, and to them that were in Athach,
1 Samuel|30|31|
1 Samuel|31|1|Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|2|And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Samuel|31|3|And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
1 Samuel|31|4|Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
1 Samuel|31|5|And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died with him.
1 Samuel|31|6|
1 Samuel|31|7|And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1 Samuel|31|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel|31|9|And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto the house of their idols, and to the people.
1 Samuel|31|10|And they put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
1 Samuel|31|11|And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard concerning him that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Samuel|31|12|all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
1 Samuel|31|13|
Deuteronomy|1|1|These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
Deuteronomy|1|2|from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|3|And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them;
Deuteronomy|1|4|after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|1|5|Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|6|Jehovah our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain:
Deuteronomy|1|7|nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Deuteronomy|1|8|
Deuteronomy|1|9|And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
Deuteronomy|1|10|Jehovah your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
Deuteronomy|1|11|Jehovah, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!
Deuteronomy|1|12|How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
Deuteronomy|1|13|Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
Deuteronomy|1|14|to do.
Deuteronomy|1|15|So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
Deuteronomy|1|16|between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.
Deuteronomy|1|17|Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.
Deuteronomy|1|18|And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
Deuteronomy|1|19|And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy|1|20|And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God giveth unto us.
Deuteronomy|1|21|Behold, Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
Deuteronomy|1|22|And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.
Deuteronomy|1|23|And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
Deuteronomy|1|24|and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
Deuteronomy|1|25|
Deuteronomy|1|26|Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God:
Deuteronomy|1|27|and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Deuteronomy|1|28|Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
Deuteronomy|1|29|Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
Deuteronomy|1|30|Jehovah your God who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
Deuteronomy|1|31|and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that Jehovah thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.
Deuteronomy|1|32|Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God,
Deuteronomy|1|33|
Deuteronomy|1|34|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
Deuteronomy|1|35|Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
Deuteronomy|1|36|save Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|1|37|Also Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither:
Deuteronomy|1|38|Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|1|39|Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy|1|40|
Deuteronomy|1|41|Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight, according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|42|And Jehovah said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
Deuteronomy|1|43|So I spake unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.
Deuteronomy|1|44|And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.
Deuteronomy|1|45|And ye returned and wept before Jehovah; but Jehovah hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
Deuteronomy|1|46|
Deuteronomy|2|1|Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Jehovah spake unto me; and we compassed mount Seir many days.
Deuteronomy|2|2|And Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|3|Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
Deuteronomy|2|4|And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore;
Deuteronomy|2|5|contend not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|6|Ye shall purchase food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
Deuteronomy|2|7|For Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; he hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Jehovah thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy|2|8|And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy|2|9|And Jehovah said unto me, Vex not Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|10|(The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
Deuteronomy|2|11|these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
Deuteronomy|2|12|The Horites also dwelt in Seir aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which Jehovah gave unto them.)
Deuteronomy|2|13|Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
Deuteronomy|2|14|And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware unto them.
Deuteronomy|2|15|
Deuteronomy|2|16|So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
Deuteronomy|2|17|that Jehovah spake unto me, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|18|Thou art this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
Deuteronomy|2|19|and when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, vex them not, nor contend with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
Deuteronomy|2|20|(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt therein aforetime; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
Deuteronomy|2|21|a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Jehovah destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;
Deuteronomy|2|22|as he did for the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
Deuteronomy|2|23|and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
Deuteronomy|2|24|Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
Deuteronomy|2|25|
Deuteronomy|2|26|And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
Deuteronomy|2|27|Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left.
Deuteronomy|2|28|Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,
Deuteronomy|2|29|as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us.
Deuteronomy|2|30|But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|2|31|And Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
Deuteronomy|2|32|Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy|2|33|And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
Deuteronomy|2|34|And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:
Deuteronomy|2|35|only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
Deuteronomy|2|36|the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us:
Deuteronomy|2|37|
Deuteronomy|3|1|Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.
Deuteronomy|3|2|And Jehovah said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
Deuteronomy|3|3|So Jehovah our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
Deuteronomy|3|4|And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy|3|5|All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.
Deuteronomy|3|6|And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.
Deuteronomy|3|7|But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey unto ourselves.
Deuteronomy|3|8|And we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon unto mount Hermon;
Deuteronomy|3|9|Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir);
Deuteronomy|3|10|all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
Deuteronomy|3|11|
Deuteronomy|3|12|And this land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
Deuteronomy|3|13|and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
Deuteronomy|3|14|Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth-jair, unto this day.)
Deuteronomy|3|15|And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
Deuteronomy|3|16|, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
Deuteronomy|3|17|
Deuteronomy|3|18|And I commanded you at that time, saying, Jehovah your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the men of valor.
Deuteronomy|3|19|But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you,
Deuteronomy|3|20|until Jehovah give rest unto your brethren, as unto you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
Deuteronomy|3|21|And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall Jehovah do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest over.
Deuteronomy|3|22|
Deuteronomy|3|23|And I besought Jehovah at that time, saying,
Deuteronomy|3|24|O Lord Jehovah, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy mighty acts?
Deuteronomy|3|25|Let me go over, I pray thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
Deuteronomy|3|26|But Jehovah was wroth with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.
Deuteronomy|3|27|Get thee up unto the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy|3|28|But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
Deuteronomy|3|29|
Deuteronomy|4|1|And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah, the God of your fathers, giveth you.
Deuteronomy|4|2|Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it, that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you.
Deuteronomy|4|3|Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-peor; for all the men that followed Baal-peor, Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|4|4|But ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day.
Deuteronomy|4|5|Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Jehovah my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the midst of the land whither ye go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|4|6|Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, that shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
Deuteronomy|4|7|For what great nation is there, that hath a god so nigh unto them, as Jehovah our God is whensoever we call upon him?
Deuteronomy|4|8|
Deuteronomy|4|9|Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children’s children;
Deuteronomy|4|10|the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, when Jehovah said unto me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
Deuteronomy|4|11|And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
Deuteronomy|4|12|a voice.
Deuteronomy|4|13|And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
Deuteronomy|4|14|
Deuteronomy|4|15|Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of form on the day that Jehovah spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy|4|16|Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
Deuteronomy|4|17|the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens,
Deuteronomy|4|18|the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
Deuteronomy|4|19|and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Jehovah thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.
Deuteronomy|4|20|But Jehovah hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|4|21|Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:
Deuteronomy|4|22|but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
Deuteronomy|4|23|Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image in the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee.
Deuteronomy|4|24|
Deuteronomy|4|25|When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God, to provoke him to anger;
Deuteronomy|4|26|I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over the Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
Deuteronomy|4|27|And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number among the nations, whither Jehovah shall lead you away.
Deuteronomy|4|28|And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
Deuteronomy|4|29|But from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt find him, when thou searchest after him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy|4|30|When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God, and hearken unto his voice:
Deuteronomy|4|31|
Deuteronomy|4|32|as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
Deuteronomy|4|33|Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
Deuteronomy|4|34|nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
Deuteronomy|4|35|Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that Jehovah he is God; there is none else besides him.
Deuteronomy|4|36|Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he made thee to see his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy|4|37|And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;
Deuteronomy|4|38|to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|4|39|Know therefore this day, and lay it to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else.
Deuteronomy|4|40|
Deuteronomy|4|41|Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy|4|42|that the manslayer might flee thither, that slayeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
Deuteronomy|4|43|
Deuteronomy|4|44|And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
Deuteronomy|4|45|these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,
Deuteronomy|4|46|beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, when they came forth out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|4|47|And they took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising;
Deuteronomy|4|48|from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even unto mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
Deuteronomy|4|49|
Deuteronomy|5|1|And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and observe to do them.
Deuteronomy|5|2|Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Deuteronomy|5|3|Jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
Deuteronomy|5|4|Jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy|5|5|
Deuteronomy|5|6|
Deuteronomy|5|7|
Deuteronomy|5|8|that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
Deuteronomy|5|9|thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I, Jehovah, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me;
Deuteronomy|5|10|
Deuteronomy|5|11|
Deuteronomy|5|12|Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
Deuteronomy|5|13|Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
Deuteronomy|5|14|thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
Deuteronomy|5|15|
Deuteronomy|5|16|
Deuteronomy|5|17|
Deuteronomy|5|18|
Deuteronomy|5|19|
Deuteronomy|5|20|
Deuteronomy|5|21|
Deuteronomy|5|22|These words Jehovah spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy|5|23|And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
Deuteronomy|5|24|and ye said, Behold, Jehovah our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth.
Deuteronomy|5|25|Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more, then we shall die.
Deuteronomy|5|26|For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Deuteronomy|5|27|
Deuteronomy|5|28|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|5|29|Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
Deuteronomy|5|30|Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.
Deuteronomy|5|31|But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
Deuteronomy|5|32|Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deuteronomy|5|33|
Deuteronomy|6|1|Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|6|2|that thou mightest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Deuteronomy|6|3|Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|6|4|Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:
Deuteronomy|6|5|and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
Deuteronomy|6|6|And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;
Deuteronomy|6|7|and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|6|8|And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.
Deuteronomy|6|9|
Deuteronomy|6|10|And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,
Deuteronomy|6|11|and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;
Deuteronomy|6|12|then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|6|13|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.
Deuteronomy|6|14|Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;
Deuteronomy|6|15|
Deuteronomy|6|16|Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
Deuteronomy|6|17|Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
Deuteronomy|6|18|And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,
Deuteronomy|6|19|
Deuteronomy|6|20|When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?
Deuteronomy|6|21|then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
Deuteronomy|6|22|and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;
Deuteronomy|6|23|and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
Deuteronomy|6|24|And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|6|25|
Deuteronomy|7|1|When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
Deuteronomy|7|2|and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;
Deuteronomy|7|3|neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
Deuteronomy|7|4|For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
Deuteronomy|7|5|
Deuteronomy|7|6|For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|7|7|Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:
Deuteronomy|7|8|but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|7|9|Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
Deuteronomy|7|10|and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
Deuteronomy|7|11|
Deuteronomy|7|12|And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:
Deuteronomy|7|13|and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
Deuteronomy|7|14|Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy|7|15|And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
Deuteronomy|7|16|
Deuteronomy|7|17|If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
Deuteronomy|7|18|thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
Deuteronomy|7|19|the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.
Deuteronomy|7|20|Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.
Deuteronomy|7|21|Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.
Deuteronomy|7|22|And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
Deuteronomy|7|23|But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.
Deuteronomy|7|24|And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy|7|25|The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|7|26|
Deuteronomy|8|1|All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers.
Deuteronomy|8|2|And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.
Deuteronomy|8|3|And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.
Deuteronomy|8|4|Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
Deuteronomy|8|5|And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.
Deuteronomy|8|6|And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
Deuteronomy|8|7|For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy|8|8|a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;
Deuteronomy|8|9|a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper.
Deuteronomy|8|10|
Deuteronomy|8|11|Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
Deuteronomy|8|12|lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
Deuteronomy|8|13|and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
Deuteronomy|8|14|then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
Deuteronomy|8|15|fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
Deuteronomy|8|16|who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:
Deuteronomy|8|17|thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
Deuteronomy|8|18|But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|8|19|And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy|8|20|
Deuteronomy|9|1|Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
Deuteronomy|9|2|a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Deuteronomy|9|3|Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee.
Deuteronomy|9|4|Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|9|5|
Deuteronomy|9|6|Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
Deuteronomy|9|7|Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|9|8|Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|9|When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
Deuteronomy|9|10|according to all the words, which Jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy|9|11|And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
Deuteronomy|9|12|And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
Deuteronomy|9|13|Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Deuteronomy|9|14|let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
Deuteronomy|9|15|So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy|9|16|And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
Deuteronomy|9|17|And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy|9|18|And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
Deuteronomy|9|19|For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.
Deuteronomy|9|20|And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
Deuteronomy|9|21|
Deuteronomy|9|22|And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked Jehovah to wrath.
Deuteronomy|9|23|And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of Jehovah your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
Deuteronomy|9|24|
Deuteronomy|9|25|So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Jehovah had said he would destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|26|And I prayed unto Jehovah, and said, O Lord Jehovah, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy|9|27|Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,
Deuteronomy|9|28|lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
Deuteronomy|9|29|
Deuteronomy|10|1|At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
Deuteronomy|10|2|And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
Deuteronomy|10|3|So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
Deuteronomy|10|4|And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Jehovah spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Jehovah gave them unto me.
Deuteronomy|10|5|And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Jehovah commanded me.
Deuteronomy|10|6|(And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.
Deuteronomy|10|7|From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
Deuteronomy|10|8|At that time Jehovah set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
Deuteronomy|10|9|Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, according as Jehovah thy God spake unto him.)
Deuteronomy|10|10|And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also; Jehovah would not destroy thee.
Deuteronomy|10|11|
Deuteronomy|10|12|And now, Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
Deuteronomy|10|13|to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
Deuteronomy|10|14|Behold, unto Jehovah thy God belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
Deuteronomy|10|15|Only Jehovah had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|10|16|Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
Deuteronomy|10|17|For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
Deuteronomy|10|18|He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.
Deuteronomy|10|19|Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|10|20|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
Deuteronomy|10|21|He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy|10|22|
Deuteronomy|11|1|Therefore thou shalt love Jehovah thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, alway.
Deuteronomy|11|2|not with your children that have not known, and that have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,
Deuteronomy|11|3|and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy|11|4|and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Jehovah hath destroyed them unto this day;
Deuteronomy|11|5|and what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place;
Deuteronomy|11|6|and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
Deuteronomy|11|7|
Deuteronomy|11|8|Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment which I command thee this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|11|9|and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|11|10|For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs;
Deuteronomy|11|11|drinketh water of the rain of heaven,
Deuteronomy|11|12|
Deuteronomy|11|13|And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy|11|14|that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy grain, and thy new wine, and thine oil.
Deuteronomy|11|15|And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be full.
Deuteronomy|11|16|Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
Deuteronomy|11|17|
Deuteronomy|11|18|Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
Deuteronomy|11|19|And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|11|20|And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates;
Deuteronomy|11|21|that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
Deuteronomy|11|22|For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;
Deuteronomy|11|23|then will Jehovah drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
Deuteronomy|11|24|Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the hinder sea shall be your border.
Deuteronomy|11|25|
Deuteronomy|11|26|Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
Deuteronomy|11|27|the blessing, if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I command you this day;
Deuteronomy|11|28|and the curse, if ye shall not hearken unto the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.
Deuteronomy|11|29|And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt set the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy|11|30|Are they not beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites that dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
Deuteronomy|11|31|For ye are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.
Deuteronomy|11|32|
Deuteronomy|12|1|These are the statutes and the ordinances which ye shall observe to do in the land which Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath given thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
Deuteronomy|12|2|Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye shall dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
Deuteronomy|12|3|and ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.
Deuteronomy|12|4|Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|12|5|But unto the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come;
Deuteronomy|12|6|and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill-offerings, and the firstlings of your herd and of your flock:
Deuteronomy|12|7|and there ye shall eat before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee.
Deuteronomy|12|8|Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes;
Deuteronomy|12|9|for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
Deuteronomy|12|10|But when ye go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit, and he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;
Deuteronomy|12|11|then it shall come to pass that to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, thither shall ye bring all that I command you: your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|12|And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates, forasmuch as he hath no portion nor inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy|12|13|Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest;
Deuteronomy|12|14|
Deuteronomy|12|15|Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh within all thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
Deuteronomy|12|16|Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|17|Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain, or of thy new wine, or of thine oil, or the firstlings of thy herd or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of thy hand;
Deuteronomy|12|18|but thou shalt eat them before Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|12|19|
Deuteronomy|12|20|When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul desireth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|21|If the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to put his name there, be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which Jehovah hath given thee, as I have commanded thee; and thou mayest eat within thy gates, after all the desire of thy soul.
Deuteronomy|12|22|Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat thereof: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike.
Deuteronomy|12|23|Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|24|Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
Deuteronomy|12|25|Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|12|26|Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which Jehovah shall choose:
Deuteronomy|12|27|and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God; and thou shalt eat the flesh.
Deuteronomy|12|28|
Deuteronomy|12|29|When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest in to dispossess them, and thou dispossessest them, and dwellest in their land;
Deuteronomy|12|30|take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
Deuteronomy|12|31|
Deuteronomy|12|32|
Deuteronomy|13|1|If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give thee a sign or a wonder,
Deuteronomy|13|2|and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
Deuteronomy|13|3|thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or unto that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah your God proveth you, to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy|13|4|Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.
Deuteronomy|13|5|
Deuteronomy|13|6|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, that is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|13|7|of the gods of the peoples that are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
Deuteronomy|13|8|thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
Deuteronomy|13|9|but thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
Deuteronomy|13|10|And thou shalt stone him to death with stones, because he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|13|11|
Deuteronomy|13|12|If thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to dwell there, saying,
Deuteronomy|13|13|Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of thee, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
Deuteronomy|13|14|then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in the midst of thee,
Deuteronomy|13|15|thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy|13|16|And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto Jehovah thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again.
Deuteronomy|13|17|And there shall cleave nought of the devoted thing to thy hand; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|13|18|
Deuteronomy|14|1|Ye are the children of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
Deuteronomy|14|2|
Deuteronomy|14|3|Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
Deuteronomy|14|4|These are the beasts which ye may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
Deuteronomy|14|5|the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the chamois.
Deuteronomy|14|6|cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Deuteronomy|14|7|Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the coney; because they chew the cud but part not the hoof, they are unclean unto you.
Deuteronomy|14|8|
Deuteronomy|14|9|These ye may eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat;
Deuteronomy|14|10|
Deuteronomy|14|11|Of all clean birds ye may eat.
Deuteronomy|14|12|But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Deuteronomy|14|13|and the glede, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|14|and every raven after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|15|and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-mew, and the hawk after its kind,
Deuteronomy|14|16|the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
Deuteronomy|14|17|and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
Deuteronomy|14|18|and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Deuteronomy|14|19|And all winged creeping things are unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.
Deuteronomy|14|20|
Deuteronomy|14|21|
Deuteronomy|14|22|Thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed, that which cometh forth from the field year by year.
Deuteronomy|14|23|And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always.
Deuteronomy|14|24|And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee;
Deuteronomy|14|25|then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose:
Deuteronomy|14|26|and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household.
Deuteronomy|14|27|
Deuteronomy|14|28|At the end of every three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase in the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
Deuteronomy|14|29|
Deuteronomy|15|1|At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
Deuteronomy|15|2|And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Jehovah’s release hath been proclaimed.
Deuteronomy|15|3|Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it: but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release.
Deuteronomy|15|4|Howbeit there shall be no poor with thee; (for Jehovah will surely bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it;)
Deuteronomy|15|5|if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy|15|6|
Deuteronomy|15|7|If there be with thee a poor man, one of thy brethren, within any of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother;
Deuteronomy|15|8|which he wanteth.
Deuteronomy|15|9|Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou give him nought; and he cry unto Jehovah against thee, and it be sin unto thee.
Deuteronomy|15|10|Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy work, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto.
Deuteronomy|15|11|
Deuteronomy|15|12|If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
Deuteronomy|15|13|And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty:
Deuteronomy|15|14|thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy threshing-floor, and out of thy winepress; as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.
Deuteronomy|15|15|And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to-day.
Deuteronomy|15|16|And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go out from thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;
Deuteronomy|15|17|then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.
Deuteronomy|15|18|
Deuteronomy|15|19|All the firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto Jehovah thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy herd, nor shear the firstling of thy flock.
Deuteronomy|15|20|Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God year by year in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou and thy household.
Deuteronomy|15|21|lame or blind, any ill blemish whatsoever, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|15|22|alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
Deuteronomy|15|23|

Deuteronomy|16|2|And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto Jehovah thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
Deuteronomy|16|3|Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

Deuteronomy|17|4|and it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, then shalt thou inquire diligently; and, behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel,

Deuteronomy|18|1|all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and his inheritance.

Deuteronomy|18|12|For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto Jehovah: and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|18|13|Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|18|14|
Deuteronomy|18|15|Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

Deuteronomy|18|17|And Jehovah said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|18|18|I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.

Deuteronomy|19|3|
Deuteronomy|19|4|And this is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee thither and live: whoso killeth his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in time past;
Deuteronomy|19|5|as when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbor, so that he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities and live:
Deuteronomy|19|6|lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and smite him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
Deuteronomy|19|7|Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt set apart three cities for thee.
Deuteronomy|19|8|And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|19|9|if thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
Deuteronomy|19|10|
Deuteronomy|19|11|But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally so that he dieth, and he flee into one of these cities;
Deuteronomy|19|12|then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

Deuteronomy|19|14|
Deuteronomy|19|15|One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
Deuteronomy|19|16|If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing,
Deuteronomy|19|17|then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days;
Deuteronomy|19|18|and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and have testified falsely against his brother;
Deuteronomy|19|19|then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.
Deuteronomy|19|20|And those that remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee.

Deuteronomy|20|3|and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint; fear not, nor tremble, neither be ye affrighted at them;
Deuteronomy|20|4|for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.

Deuteronomy|20|9|
Deuteronomy|20|10|When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
Deuteronomy|20|11|And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.
Deuteronomy|20|12|And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
Deuteronomy|20|13|and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
Deuteronomy|20|14|but the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take for a prey unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which Jehovah thy God hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|20|15|Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
Deuteronomy|20|16|But of the cities of these peoples, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth;
Deuteronomy|20|17|but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee;
Deuteronomy|20|18|
Deuteronomy|20|19|When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an axe against them; for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged of thee?
Deuteronomy|20|20|
Deuteronomy|21|1|If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;
Deuteronomy|21|2|then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:
Deuteronomy|21|3|and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
Deuteronomy|21|4|and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
Deuteronomy|21|5|And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
Deuteronomy|21|6|And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;
Deuteronomy|21|7|and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
Deuteronomy|21|8|in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

Deuteronomy|21|10|When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,
Deuteronomy|21|11|and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;
Deuteronomy|21|12|then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
Deuteronomy|21|13|and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
Deuteronomy|21|14|
Deuteronomy|21|15|If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;
Deuteronomy|21|16|then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:
Deuteronomy|21|17|
Deuteronomy|21|18|If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;
Deuteronomy|21|19|then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
Deuteronomy|21|20|and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
Deuteronomy|21|21|
Deuteronomy|21|22|And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;
Deuteronomy|21|23|
Deuteronomy|22|1|Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely bring them again unto thy brother.
Deuteronomy|22|2|And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him.
Deuteronomy|22|3|And so shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his garment; and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found: thou mayest not hide thyself.
Deuteronomy|22|4|
Deuteronomy|22|5|
Deuteronomy|22|6|If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:

Deuteronomy|22|9|Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which thou hast sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
Deuteronomy|22|10|Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

Deuteronomy|22|12|
Deuteronomy|22|13|If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
Deuteronomy|22|14|and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity;
Deuteronomy|22|15|then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate;
Deuteronomy|22|16|and the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
Deuteronomy|22|17|, saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
Deuteronomy|22|18|And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;
Deuteronomy|22|19|of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
Deuteronomy|22|20|But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel;
Deuteronomy|22|21|
Deuteronomy|22|22|
Deuteronomy|22|23|If there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
Deuteronomy|22|24|
Deuteronomy|22|25|But if the man find the damsel that is betrothed in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:
Deuteronomy|22|26|but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter;
Deuteronomy|22|27|
Deuteronomy|22|28|If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, that is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

Deuteronomy|23|2|
Deuteronomy|23|3|An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Jehovah for ever:
Deuteronomy|23|4|because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
Deuteronomy|23|5|Nevertheless Jehovah thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but Jehovah thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because Jehovah thy God loved thee.

Deuteronomy|26|7|and we cried unto Jehovah, the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;
Deuteronomy|26|8|and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders;
Deuteronomy|26|9|and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|26|10|And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O Jehovah, hast given me. And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God:
Deuteronomy|26|11|
Deuteronomy|26|12|When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled.
Deuteronomy|26|13|And thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed any of thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:
Deuteronomy|26|14|I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
Deuteronomy|26|15|
Deuteronomy|26|16|This day Jehovah thy God commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
Deuteronomy|26|17|Thou hast avouched Jehovah this day to be thy God, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice:
Deuteronomy|26|18|and Jehovah hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments;
Deuteronomy|26|19|
Deuteronomy|27|1|And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
Deuteronomy|27|2|And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
Deuteronomy|27|3|and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over; that thou mayest go in unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised thee.
Deuteronomy|27|4|And it shall be, when ye are passed over the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.

Deuteronomy|27|12|These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
Deuteronomy|27|13|And these shall stand upon mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

Deuteronomy|28|45|And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:
Deuteronomy|28|46|
Deuteronomy|28|47|Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;
Deuteronomy|28|48|therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies that Jehovah shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

Deuteronomy|28|58|If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;
Deuteronomy|28|59|then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
Deuteronomy|28|60|And he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

Deuteronomy|28|65|And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;
Deuteronomy|28|66|and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.
Deuteronomy|28|67|In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

Deuteronomy|29|1|
Deuteronomy|29|2|And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
Deuteronomy|29|3|the great trials which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
Deuteronomy|29|4|but Jehovah hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
Deuteronomy|29|5|And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxed old upon thy foot.
Deuteronomy|29|6|Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink; that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|29|7|And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:
Deuteronomy|29|8|and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
Deuteronomy|29|9|
Deuteronomy|29|10|Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,
Deuteronomy|29|11|your little ones, your wives, and thy sojourner that is in the midst of thy camps, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water;
Deuteronomy|29|12|that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day;
Deuteronomy|29|13|
Deuteronomy|29|14|Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
Deuteronomy|29|15|but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day
Deuteronomy|29|16|(for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed;
Deuteronomy|29|17|and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
Deuteronomy|29|18|lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
Deuteronomy|29|19|and it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.
Deuteronomy|29|20|Jehovah will not pardon him, but then the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie upon him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.
Deuteronomy|29|21|
Deuteronomy|29|22|And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath made it sick;
Deuteronomy|29|23|it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
Deuteronomy|29|24|even all the nations shall say, Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
Deuteronomy|29|25|Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
Deuteronomy|29|26|and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that he had not given unto them:
Deuteronomy|29|27|therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book;
Deuteronomy|29|28|and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|29|29|
Deuteronomy|30|1|And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee,
Deuteronomy|30|2|and shalt return unto Jehovah thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
Deuteronomy|30|3|that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee.
Deuteronomy|30|4|thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:
Deuteronomy|30|5|and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
Deuteronomy|30|6|And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
Deuteronomy|30|7|And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.
Deuteronomy|30|8|And thou shalt return and obey the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
Deuteronomy|30|9|And Jehovah thy God will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers;
Deuteronomy|30|10|
Deuteronomy|30|11|For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
Deuteronomy|30|12|It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|13|Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
Deuteronomy|30|14|
Deuteronomy|30|15|See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
Deuteronomy|30|16|in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|17|But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
Deuteronomy|30|18|I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
Deuteronomy|30|19|I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed;
Deuteronomy|30|20|
Deuteronomy|31|1|And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|2|And he said unto them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
Deuteronomy|31|3|Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Deuteronomy|31|4|And Jehovah will do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and unto their land; whom he destroyed.
Deuteronomy|31|5|And Jehovah will deliver them up before you, and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy|31|6|Be strong and of good courage, fear not, nor be affrighted at them: for Jehovah thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
Deuteronomy|31|7|And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for thou shalt go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
Deuteronomy|31|8|
Deuteronomy|31|9|And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and unto all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|10|seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
Deuteronomy|31|11|when all Israel is come to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
Deuteronomy|31|12|Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and thy sojourner that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Jehovah your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
Deuteronomy|31|13|
Deuteronomy|31|14|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
Deuteronomy|31|15|And Jehovah appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
Deuteronomy|31|16|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the harlot after the strange gods of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
Deuteronomy|31|17|Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
Deuteronomy|31|18|And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
Deuteronomy|31|19|Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach thou it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|20|For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
Deuteronomy|31|21|And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.
Deuteronomy|31|22|So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy|31|23|
Deuteronomy|31|24|And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
Deuteronomy|31|25|that Moses commanded the Levites, that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
Deuteronomy|31|26|Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
Deuteronomy|31|27|For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah; and how much more after my death?
Deuteronomy|31|28|Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.

Deuteronomy|32|49|Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;
Deuteronomy|32|50|and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
Deuteronomy|32|51|because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

Deuteronomy|34|3|and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar.
Deuteronomy|34|4|And Jehovah said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
Deuteronomy|34|5|So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|34|6|And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
Deuteronomy|34|7|And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
Deuteronomy|34|8|
Deuteronomy|34|9|And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Deuteronomy|34|10|And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
Deuteronomy|34|11|in all the signs and the wonders, which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
Deuteronomy|34|12|
1 John|1|1|That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life
1 John|1|2|, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us);
1 John|1|3|that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:
1 John|1|4|and these things we write, that our joy may be made full.
1 John|1|5|And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1 John|1|6|If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:
1 John|1|7|but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
1 John|1|8|If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
1 John|1|9|If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1 John|1|10|
1 John|2|1|My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
1 John|2|2|and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
1 John|2|3|And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
1 John|2|4|He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
1 John|2|5|but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:
1 John|2|6|he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
1 John|2|7|Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.
1 John|2|8|Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.
1 John|2|9|He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
1 John|2|10|He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
1 John|2|11|But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1 John|2|12|little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
1 John|2|13|I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.
1 John|2|14|I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.
1 John|2|15|Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
1 John|2|16|For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
1 John|2|17|And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
1 John|2|18|Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour.
1 John|2|19|, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.
1 John|2|20|And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all the things.
1 John|2|21|I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
1 John|2|22|he that denieth the Father and the Son.
1 John|2|23|Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also.
1 John|2|24|As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.
1 John|2|25|the life eternal.
1 John|2|26|These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.
1 John|2|27|And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you; concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.
1 John|2|28|little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
1 John|2|29|
1 John|3|1|we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
1 John|3|2|Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.
1 John|3|3|on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
1 John|3|4|Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
1 John|3|5|And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.
1 John|3|6|Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.
1 John|3|7|little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:
1 John|3|8|he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
1 John|3|9|Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.
1 John|3|10|In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
1 John|3|11|For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:
1 John|3|12|not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
1 John|3|13|Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.
1 John|3|14|We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.
1 John|3|15|Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
1 John|3|16|Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
1 John|3|17|But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?
1 John|3|18|Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.
1 John|3|19|Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him:
1 John|3|20|because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
1 John|3|21|Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;
1 John|3|22|and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
1 John|3|23|And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.
1 John|3|24|
1 John|4|1|Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
1 John|4|2|Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
1 John|4|3|of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.
1 John|4|4|little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
1 John|4|5|of the world, and the world heareth them.
1 John|4|6|We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
1 John|4|7|Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.
1 John|4|8|He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
1 John|4|9|Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.
1 John|4|10|the propitiation for our sins.
1 John|4|11|Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
1 John|4|12|No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:
1 John|4|13|hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
1 John|4|14|the Saviour of the world.
1 John|4|15|Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.
1 John|4|16|And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.
1 John|4|17|Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.
1 John|4|18|There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.
1 John|4|19|We love, because he first loved us.
1 John|4|20|If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.
1 John|4|21|
1 John|5|1|Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
1 John|5|2|Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments.
1 John|5|3|For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
1 John|5|4|our faith.
1 John|5|5|And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?
1 John|5|6|Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
1 John|5|7|And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
1 John|5|8|For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.
1 John|5|9|If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.
1 John|5|10|He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son.
1 John|5|11|And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
1 John|5|12|He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life.
1 John|5|13|unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God.
1 John|5|14|And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us:
1 John|5|15|and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
1 John|5|16|will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.
1 John|5|17|All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
1 John|5|18|We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.
1 John|5|19|We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.
1 John|5|20|in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
1 John|5|21|
Philemon|1|1|Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
Philemon|1|2|and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
Philemon|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon|1|4|I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
Philemon|1|5|hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
Philemon|1|6|that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
Philemon|1|7|For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
Philemon|1|8|Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
Philemon|1|9|yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
Philemon|1|10|I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
Philemon|1|11|who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
Philemon|1|12|whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
Philemon|1|13|whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Philemon|1|14|but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
Philemon|1|15|for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
Philemon|1|16|no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon|1|17|If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon|1|18|aught, put that to mine account;
Philemon|1|19|I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
Philemon|1|20|Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon|1|21|Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
Philemon|1|22|But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
Philemon|1|23|Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
Philemon|1|24|Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
Philemon|1|25|
