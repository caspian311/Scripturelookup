1 Chronicles|28|4|Howbeit Jehovah, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;

1 Chronicles|28|7|And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and mine ordinances, as at this day.
1 Chronicles|28|8|Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Jehovah, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God; that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you for ever.
1 Chronicles|28|9|And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
1 Chronicles|28|10|Take heed now; for Jehovah hath chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

1 Chronicles|28|13|also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah;
1 Chronicles|28|14|of gold by weight for the {vessels of} gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; {of silver} for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;

1 Chronicles|28|18|and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, {even} the cherubim, that spread out {their wings}, and covered the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles|28|19|All this, {said David}, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Jehovah, even all the works of this pattern.
1 Chronicles|28|20|And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed; for Jehovah God, even my God, is with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah be finished.
1 Chronicles|28|21|And, behold, there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee in all manner of work every willing man that hath skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
1 Chronicles|29|1|And David the king said unto all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Jehovah God.
1 Chronicles|29|2|Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the {things of} gold, and the silver for the {things of} silver, and the brass for the {things of} brass, the iron for the {things of} iron, and wood for the {things of} wood; onyx stones, and {stones} to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
1 Chronicles|29|3|Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
1 Chronicles|29|4|even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;
1 Chronicles|29|5|of gold for the {things of} gold, and of silver for the {things of} silver, and for all manner of work {to be made} by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?
1 Chronicles|29|6|Then the princes of the fathers’ {houses}, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;
1 Chronicles|29|7|and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
1 Chronicles|29|8|And they with whom {precious} stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles|29|9|Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
1 Chronicles|29|10|Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
1 Chronicles|29|11|Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth {is thine}; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.
1 Chronicles|29|12|Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
1 Chronicles|29|13|Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1 Chronicles|29|14|But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
1 Chronicles|29|15|For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
1 Chronicles|29|16|O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own.
1 Chronicles|29|17|I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto thee.
1 Chronicles|29|18|O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;
1 Chronicles|29|19|and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
1 Chronicles|29|20|And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.

1 Chronicles|29|22|and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness.      And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
1 Chronicles|29|23|Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

1 Chronicles|29|28|And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles|29|29|Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
1 Chronicles|29|30|with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
2 Samuel|1|1|And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
2 Samuel|1|2|it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
2 Samuel|1|3|And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
2 Samuel|1|4|And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
2 Samuel|1|5|And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
