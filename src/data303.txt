Deuteronomy|5|26|For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
Deuteronomy|5|27|Go thou near, and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
Deuteronomy|5|28|And Jehovah heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and Jehovah said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
Deuteronomy|5|29|Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
Deuteronomy|5|30|Go say to them, Return ye to your tents.
Deuteronomy|5|31|But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
Deuteronomy|5|32|Ye shall observe to do therefore as Jehovah your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deuteronomy|5|33|Ye shall walk in all the way which Jehovah your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
Deuteronomy|6|1|Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it;
Deuteronomy|6|2|that thou mightest fear Jehovah thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
Deuteronomy|6|3|Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as Jehovah, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy|6|4|Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah:
Deuteronomy|6|5|and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
Deuteronomy|6|6|And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;
Deuteronomy|6|7|and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
Deuteronomy|6|8|And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.
Deuteronomy|6|9|And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.
Deuteronomy|6|10|And it shall be, when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee, great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not,
Deuteronomy|6|11|and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out, which thou hewedst not, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou plantedst not, and thou shalt eat and be full;
Deuteronomy|6|12|then beware lest thou forget Jehovah, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy|6|13|Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.
Deuteronomy|6|14|Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;
Deuteronomy|6|15|for Jehovah thy God in the midst of thee is a jealous God; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee, and he destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|6|16|Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
Deuteronomy|6|17|Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
Deuteronomy|6|18|And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers,
Deuteronomy|6|19|to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as Jehovah hath spoken.
Deuteronomy|6|20|When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Jehovah our God hath commanded you?
Deuteronomy|6|21|then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt: and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
Deuteronomy|6|22|and Jehovah showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes;
Deuteronomy|6|23|and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
Deuteronomy|6|24|And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|6|25|And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as he hath commanded us.
Deuteronomy|7|1|When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
Deuteronomy|7|2|and when Jehovah thy God shall deliver them up before thee, and thou shalt smite them; then thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them;
Deuteronomy|7|3|neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
Deuteronomy|7|4|For he will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Jehovah be kindled against you, and he will destroy thee quickly.
Deuteronomy|7|5|But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.
Deuteronomy|7|6|For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God: Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy|7|7|Jehovah did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all peoples:
Deuteronomy|7|8|but because Jehovah loveth you, and because he would keep the oath which he sware unto your fathers, hath Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy|7|9|Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
Deuteronomy|7|10|and repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
Deuteronomy|7|11|Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command thee this day, to do them.
Deuteronomy|7|12|And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the lovingkindness which he sware unto thy fathers:
Deuteronomy|7|13|and he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground, thy grain and thy new wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cattle and the young of thy flock, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
Deuteronomy|7|14|Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
Deuteronomy|7|15|And Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, will he put upon thee, but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
Deuteronomy|7|16|And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God shall deliver unto thee; thine eye shall not pity them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.
Deuteronomy|7|17|If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
Deuteronomy|7|18|thou shalt not be afraid of them: thou shalt well remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
Deuteronomy|7|19|the great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples of whom thou art afraid.
Deuteronomy|7|20|Moreover Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves, perish from before thee.
Deuteronomy|7|21|Thou shalt not be affrighted at them; for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great God and a terrible.
Deuteronomy|7|22|And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
Deuteronomy|7|23|But Jehovah thy God will deliver them up before thee, and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture, until they be destroyed.
Deuteronomy|7|24|And he will deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt make their name to perish from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
Deuteronomy|7|25|The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
Deuteronomy|7|26|And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, and become a devoted thing like unto it: thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
Deuteronomy|8|1|All the commandment which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware unto your fathers.
Deuteronomy|8|2|And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or not.
Deuteronomy|8|3|And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live.
Deuteronomy|8|4|Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
Deuteronomy|8|5|And thou shalt consider in thy heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee.
Deuteronomy|8|6|And thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
Deuteronomy|8|7|For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills;
Deuteronomy|8|8|a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey;
Deuteronomy|8|9|a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig copper.
Deuteronomy|8|10|And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
Deuteronomy|8|11|Beware lest thou forget Jehovah thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
Deuteronomy|8|12|lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;
Deuteronomy|8|13|and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;
Deuteronomy|8|14|then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget Jehovah thy God, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
Deuteronomy|8|15|who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness, {wherein were} fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
Deuteronomy|8|16|who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end:
Deuteronomy|8|17|and {lest} thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
Deuteronomy|8|18|But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as at this day.
Deuteronomy|8|19|And it shall be, if thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
Deuteronomy|8|20|As the nations that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God.
Deuteronomy|9|1|Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
Deuteronomy|9|2|a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Deuteronomy|9|3|Know therefore this day, that Jehovah thy God is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Jehovah hath spoken unto thee.
Deuteronomy|9|4|Speak not thou in thy heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah doth drive them out from before thee.
Deuteronomy|9|5|Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Jehovah thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Jehovah sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Deuteronomy|9|6|Know therefore, that Jehovah thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
Deuteronomy|9|7|Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against Jehovah.
Deuteronomy|9|8|Also in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath, and Jehovah was angry with you to destroy you.
Deuteronomy|9|9|When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
Deuteronomy|9|10|And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them {was written} according to all the words, which Jehovah speak with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
Deuteronomy|9|11|And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
Deuteronomy|9|12|And Jehovah said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
Deuteronomy|9|13|Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
Deuteronomy|9|14|let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
Deuteronomy|9|15|So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
Deuteronomy|9|16|And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
Deuteronomy|9|17|And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
Deuteronomy|9|18|And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
Deuteronomy|9|19|For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you. But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.
Deuteronomy|9|20|And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
Deuteronomy|9|21|And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
