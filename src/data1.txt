2 John|1|1|The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;
2 John|1|2|for the truth’s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever:
2 John|1|3|Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
2 John|1|4|I rejoice greatly that I have found {certain} of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
2 John|1|5|And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
2 John|1|6|And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
2 John|1|7|For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, {even} they that confess not that Jesus Christ cometh in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
2 John|1|8|Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.
2 John|1|9|Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of Christ, hath not God: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the Father and the Son.
2 John|1|10|If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into {your} house, and give him no greeting:
2 John|1|11|for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
2 John|1|12|Having many things to write unto you, I would not {write them} with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
2 John|1|13|The children of thine elect sister salute thee.
Colossians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
Colossians|1|2|To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ {that are} at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians|1|3|We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Colossians|1|4|having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have toward all the saints,
Colossians|1|5|because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
Colossians|1|6|which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as {it doth} in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
Colossians|1|7|even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
Colossians|1|8|who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians|1|9|For this cause we also, since the day we heard {it}, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians|1|10|to walk worthily of the Lord unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians|1|11|strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;
Colossians|1|12|giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
Colossians|1|13|who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;
Colossians|1|14|in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:
Colossians|1|15|who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;
Colossians|1|16|for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him;
Colossians|1|17|and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.
Colossians|1|18|And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
Colossians|1|19|For it was the good pleasure {of the Father} that in him should all the fulness dwell;
Colossians|1|20|and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, {I say}, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.
Colossians|1|21|And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works,
Colossians|1|22|yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:
Colossians|1|23|if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.
Colossians|1|24|Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church;
Colossians|1|25|whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil the word of God,
Colossians|1|26|{even} the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints,
Colossians|1|27|to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
Colossians|1|28|whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;
Colossians|1|29|whereunto I labor also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
Colossians|2|1|For I would have you know how greatly I strive for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
Colossians|2|2|that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, {even} Christ,
Colossians|2|3|in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden.
Colossians|2|4|This I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech.
Colossians|2|5|For though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians|2|6|As therefore ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, {so} walk in him,
Colossians|2|7|rooted and builded up in him, and established in your faith, even as ye were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
Colossians|2|8|Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ:
Colossians|2|9|for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,
Colossians|2|10|and in him ye are made full, who is the head of all principality and power:
Colossians|2|11|in whom ye were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
Colossians|2|12|having been buried with him in baptism, wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
Colossians|2|13|And you, being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you, {I say}, did he make alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses;
Colossians|2|14|having blotted out the bond written in ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he hath taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;
Colossians|2|15|having despoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
Colossians|2|16|Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day:
Colossians|2|17|which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s.
Colossians|2|18|Let no man rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he hath seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
Colossians|2|19|and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increasing with the increase of God.
Colossians|2|20|If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances,
Colossians|2|21|Handle not, nor taste, nor touch
Colossians|2|22|(all which things are to perish with the using), after the precepts and doctrines of men?
Colossians|2|23|Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; {but are} not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
Colossians|3|1|If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.
Colossians|3|2|Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.
Colossians|3|3|For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Colossians|3|4|When Christ, {who is} our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.
Colossians|3|5|Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
Colossians|3|6|for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:
Colossians|3|7|wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;
Colossians|3|8|but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:
Colossians|3|9|lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,
Colossians|3|10|and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:
Colossians|3|11|where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
Colossians|3|12|Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;
Colossians|3|13|forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye:
Colossians|3|14|and above all these things {put on} love, which is the bond of perfectness.
Colossians|3|15|And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.
Colossians|3|16|Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms {and} hymns {and} spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.
Colossians|3|17|And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, {do} all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
Colossians|3|18|Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Colossians|3|19|Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
Colossians|3|20|Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.
Colossians|3|21|Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.
Colossians|3|22|Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:
Colossians|3|23|whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;
Colossians|3|24|knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians|3|25|For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
Colossians|4|1|Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
Colossians|4|2|Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;
Colossians|4|3|withal praying for us also, that God may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;
Colossians|4|4|that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
Colossians|4|5|Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
Colossians|4|6|Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.
Colossians|4|7|All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord:
Colossians|4|8|whom I have sent you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts;
Colossians|4|9|together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things that {are done} here.
Colossians|4|10|Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him),
Colossians|4|11|and Jesus that is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only {are my} fellow-workers unto the kingdom of God, men that have been a comfort unto me.
Colossians|4|12|Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.
Colossians|4|13|For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
Colossians|4|14|Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you.
Colossians|4|15|Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in their house.
Colossians|4|16|And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.
Colossians|4|17|And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
Colossians|4|18|The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
Matthew|1|1|The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Matthew|1|2|Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;
Matthew|1|3|and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;
Matthew|1|4|and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;
Matthew|1|5|and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
Matthew|1|6|and Jesse begat David the king.      And David begat Solomon of her {that had been the wife} of Uriah;
Matthew|1|7|and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;
Matthew|1|8|and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;
Matthew|1|9|and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;
Matthew|1|10|and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;
Matthew|1|11|and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
Matthew|1|12|And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;
Matthew|1|13|and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
Matthew|1|14|and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
Matthew|1|15|and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
Matthew|1|16|and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Matthew|1|17|So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.
Matthew|1|18|Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|19|And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
Matthew|1|20|But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|21|And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.
Matthew|1|22|Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
Matthew|1|23|Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,                   And they shall call his name Immanuel;            which is, being interpreted, God with us.
Matthew|1|24|And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;
Matthew|1|25|and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.
Matthew|2|1|Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew|2|2|Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
Matthew|2|3|And when Herod the king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew|2|4|And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
Matthew|2|5|And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written through the prophet,
Matthew|2|6|And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,                   Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah:                   For out of thee shall come forth a governor,                   Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel.
Matthew|2|7|Then Herod privily called the Wise-men, and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.
Matthew|2|8|And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search out exactly concerning the young child; and when ye have found {him,} bring me word, that I also may come and worship him.
Matthew|2|9|And they, having heard the king, went their way; and lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
Matthew|2|10|And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
Matthew|2|11|And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother; and they fell down and worshipped him; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew|2|12|And being warned {of God} in a dream that they should not  return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
Matthew|2|13|Now when they were departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Matthew|2|14|And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt;
Matthew|2|15|and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt did I call my son.
Matthew|2|16|Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise-men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise-men.
Matthew|2|17|Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|2|18|A voice was heard in Ramah,                   Weeping and great mourning,                   Rachel weeping for her children;                   And she would not be comforted, because they are not.
Matthew|2|19|But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
Matthew|2|20|Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead that sought the young child’s life.
Matthew|2|21|And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
Matthew|2|22|But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither; and being warned {of God} in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,
Matthew|2|23|and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, that he should be called a Nazarene.
Matthew|3|1|And in those days cometh John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying,
Matthew|3|2|Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|3|3|For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying,             The voice of one crying in the wilderness,                   Make ye ready the way of the Lord,                   Make his paths straight.
Matthew|3|4|Now John himself had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew|3|5|Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan;
Matthew|3|6|and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
Matthew|3|7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said unto them, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Matthew|3|8|Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance:
Matthew|3|9|and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
Matthew|3|10|And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew|3|11|I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and {in} fire:
Matthew|3|12|whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing-floor; and he will gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Matthew|3|13|Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
Matthew|3|14|But John would have hindered him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
Matthew|3|15|But Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer {it} now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffereth him.
Matthew|3|16|And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him;
Matthew|3|17|and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Matthew|4|1|Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
Matthew|4|2|And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
Matthew|4|3|And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
Matthew|4|4|But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
Matthew|4|5|Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple,
Matthew|4|6|and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,             He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:            and,             On their hands they shall bear thee up,                   Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
Matthew|4|7|Jesus said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God.
Matthew|4|8|Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
Matthew|4|9|and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
Matthew|4|10|Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
Matthew|4|11|Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
Matthew|4|12|Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee;
Matthew|4|13|and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:
Matthew|4|14|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|4|15|The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,                   Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,                   Galilee of the Gentiles,
Matthew|4|16|The people that sat in darkness                   Saw a great light,                   And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,                   To them did light spring up.
Matthew|4|17|From that time began Jesus to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|4|18|And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
Matthew|4|19|And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew|4|20|And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
Matthew|4|21|And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
Matthew|4|22|And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.
Matthew|4|23|And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.
Matthew|4|24|And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
Matthew|4|25|And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and {from} beyond the Jordan.
Matthew|5|1|And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:
Matthew|5|2|and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
Matthew|5|3|Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|4|Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Matthew|5|5|Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Matthew|5|6|Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Matthew|5|7|Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Matthew|5|8|Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Matthew|5|9|Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.
Matthew|5|10|Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|11|Blessed are ye when {men} shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Matthew|5|12|Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you.
Matthew|5|13|Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.
Matthew|5|14|Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
Matthew|5|15|Neither do {men} light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.
Matthew|5|16|Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|5|17|Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.
Matthew|5|18|For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.
Matthew|5|19|Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|20|For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed {the righteousness} of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|5|21|Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
Matthew|5|22|but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.
Matthew|5|23|If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,
Matthew|5|24|leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
Matthew|5|25|Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
Matthew|5|26|Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.
Matthew|5|27|Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
Matthew|5|28|but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
Matthew|5|29|And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.
Matthew|5|30|And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.
Matthew|5|31|It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
Matthew|5|32|but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.
Matthew|5|33|Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
Matthew|5|34|but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;
Matthew|5|35|nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Matthew|5|36|Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.
Matthew|5|37|But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil {one}.
Matthew|5|38|Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
Matthew|5|39|but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Matthew|5|40|And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
Matthew|5|41|And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.
Matthew|5|42|Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
Matthew|5|43|Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:
Matthew|5|44|but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;
Matthew|5|45|that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.
Matthew|5|46|For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
Matthew|5|47|And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more {than others?} do not even the Gentiles the same?
Matthew|5|48|Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Matthew|6|1|Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|6|2|When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|3|But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
Matthew|6|4|that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
Matthew|6|5|And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|6|But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee.
Matthew|6|7|And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
Matthew|6|8|Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
Matthew|6|9|After this manner therefore pray ye. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Matthew|6|10|Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Matthew|6|11|Give us this day our daily bread.
Matthew|6|12|And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Matthew|6|13|And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil {one.}
Matthew|6|14|For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
Matthew|6|15|But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
Matthew|6|16|Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward.
Matthew|6|17|But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
Matthew|6|18|that thou be not seen of men to fast, but of thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee.
Matthew|6|19|Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:
Matthew|6|20|but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
Matthew|6|21|for where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also.
Matthew|6|22|The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
Matthew|6|23|But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is the darkness!
Matthew|6|24|No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Matthew|6|25|Therefore I say unto you, be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment?
Matthew|6|26|Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value then they?
Matthew|6|27|And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life?
Matthew|6|28|And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
Matthew|6|29|yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Matthew|6|30|But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, {shall he} not much more {clothe} you, O ye of little faith?
Matthew|6|31|Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
Matthew|6|32|For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
Matthew|6|33|But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Matthew|6|34|Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
Matthew|7|1|Judge not, that ye be not judged.
Matthew|7|2|For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.
Matthew|7|3|And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Matthew|7|4|Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?
Matthew|7|5|Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
Matthew|7|6|Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you.
Matthew|7|7|Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
Matthew|7|8|for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Matthew|7|9|Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;
Matthew|7|10|or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?
Matthew|7|11|If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
Matthew|7|12|All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.
Matthew|7|13|Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many are they that enter in thereby.
Matthew|7|14|For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leadeth unto life, and few are they that find it.
Matthew|7|15|Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
Matthew|7|16|By their fruits ye shall know them. Do {men} gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
Matthew|7|17|Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
Matthew|7|18|A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Matthew|7|19|Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
Matthew|7|20|Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
Matthew|7|21|Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|7|22|Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out demons, and by thy name do many mighty works?
Matthew|7|23|And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
Matthew|7|24|Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the rock:
Matthew|7|25|and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and if fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.
Matthew|7|26|And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:
Matthew|7|27|and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.
Matthew|7|28|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:
Matthew|7|29|for he taught them as {one} having authority, and not as their scribes.
Matthew|8|1|And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
Matthew|8|2|And behold, there came to him a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Matthew|8|3|And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew|8|4|And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Matthew|8|5|And when he was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
Matthew|8|6|and saying, Lord, my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
Matthew|8|7|And he saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
Matthew|8|8|And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
Matthew|8|9|For I also am a man under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
Matthew|8|10|And when Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
Matthew|8|11|And I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:
Matthew|8|12|but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|8|13|And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as thou hast believed, {so} be it done unto thee. And the servant was healed in that hour.
Matthew|8|14|And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick of a fever.
Matthew|8|15|And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and ministered unto him.
Matthew|8|16|And when even was come, they brought unto him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick:
Matthew|8|17|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.
Matthew|8|18|Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandments to depart unto the other side.
Matthew|8|19|And there came a scribe, and said unto him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
Matthew|8|20|And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven {have} nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
Matthew|8|21|And another of the disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
Matthew|8|22|But Jesus saith unto him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.
Matthew|8|23|And when he was entered into a boat, his disciples followed him.
Matthew|8|24|And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.
Matthew|8|25|And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Save, Lord; we perish.
Matthew|8|26|And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
Matthew|8|27|And the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?
Matthew|8|28|And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming forth out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man could pass by that way.
Matthew|8|29|And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
Matthew|8|30|Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
Matthew|8|31|And the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.
Matthew|8|32|And he said unto them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.
Matthew|8|33|And they that fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons.
Matthew|8|34|And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought {him} that he would depart from their borders.
Matthew|9|1|And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
Matthew|9|2|And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.
Matthew|9|3|And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
Matthew|9|4|And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?
Matthew|9|5|For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?
Matthew|9|6|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go up unto thy house.
Matthew|9|7|And he arose, and departed to his house.
Matthew|9|8|But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.
Matthew|9|9|And as Jesus passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
Matthew|9|10|And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
Matthew|9|11|And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners?
Matthew|9|12|But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
Matthew|9|13|But go ye and learn what {this} meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Matthew|9|14|Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
Matthew|9|15|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
Matthew|9|16|And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
Matthew|9|17|Neither do {men} put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.
Matthew|9|18|While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
Matthew|9|19|And Jesus arose, and followed him, and {so did} his disciples.
Matthew|9|20|And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:
Matthew|9|21|for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.
Matthew|9|22|But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
Matthew|9|23|And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,
Matthew|9|24|he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
Matthew|9|25|But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.
Matthew|9|26|And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.
Matthew|9|27|And as Jesus passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|9|28|And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
Matthew|9|29|Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.
Matthew|9|30|And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
Matthew|9|31|But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
Matthew|9|32|And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
Matthew|9|33|And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
Matthew|9|34|But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
Matthew|9|35|And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
Matthew|9|36|But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Matthew|9|37|Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
Matthew|9|38|Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
Matthew|10|1|And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
Matthew|10|2|Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew|10|3|Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the {son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew|10|4|Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
Matthew|10|5|These twelve Jesus sent forth, and charged them, saying, Go not into {any} way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans:
Matthew|10|6|but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|10|7|And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Matthew|10|8|Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons: freely ye received, freely give.
Matthew|10|9|Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
Matthew|10|10|no wallet for {your} journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
Matthew|10|11|And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter, search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go forth.
Matthew|10|12|And as ye enter into the house, salute it.
Matthew|10|13|And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
Matthew|10|14|And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your feet.
Matthew|10|15|Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Matthew|10|16|Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
Matthew|10|17|But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you;
Matthew|10|18|yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
Matthew|10|19|But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
Matthew|10|20|For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
Matthew|10|21|And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
Matthew|10|22|And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew|10|23|But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
Matthew|10|24|A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
Matthew|10|25|It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household!
Matthew|10|26|Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
Matthew|10|27|What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the house-tops.
Matthew|10|28|And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Matthew|10|29|Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father:
Matthew|10|30|but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew|10|31|Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew|10|32|Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|10|33|But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|10|34|Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.
Matthew|10|35|For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law:
Matthew|10|36|and a man’s foes {shall be} they of his own household.
Matthew|10|37|He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|38|And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me, is not worthy of me.
Matthew|10|39|He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew|10|40|He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.
Matthew|10|41|He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward: and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew|10|42|And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward.
Matthew|11|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities.
Matthew|11|2|Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent by his disciples
Matthew|11|3|and said unto him, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
Matthew|11|4|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see:
Matthew|11|5|the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good tidings preached to them.
Matthew|11|6|And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
Matthew|11|7|And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind?
Matthew|11|8|But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft {raiment}? Behold, they that wear soft {raiment} are in king’s houses.
Matthew|11|9|But wherefore went ye out? to see a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
Matthew|11|10|This is he, of whom it is written,             Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,                   Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Matthew|11|11|Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Matthew|11|12|And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and men of violence take it by force.
Matthew|11|13|For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
Matthew|11|14|And if ye are willing to receive {it,} this is Elijah, that is to come.
Matthew|11|15|He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|11|16|But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows
Matthew|11|17|and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn.
Matthew|11|18|For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.
Matthew|11|19|The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is justified by her works.
Matthew|11|20|Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not.
Matthew|11|21|Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew|11|22|But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew|11|23|And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades: for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee, it would have remained until this day.
Matthew|11|24|But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.
Matthew|11|25|At that season Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes:
Matthew|11|26|yea, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
Matthew|11|27|All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth any know the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal {him.}
Matthew|11|28|Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Matthew|11|29|Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
Matthew|11|30|For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
Matthew|12|1|At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.
Matthew|12|2|But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.
Matthew|12|3|But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him;
Matthew|12|4|how he entered into the house of God, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?
Matthew|12|5|Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless?
Matthew|12|6|But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.
Matthew|12|7|But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew|12|8|For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath.
Matthew|12|9|And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue:
Matthew|12|10|and behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.
Matthew|12|11|And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?
Matthew|12|12|How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
Matthew|12|13|Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
Matthew|12|14|But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
Matthew|12|15|And Jesus perceiving {it} withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all,
Matthew|12|16|and charged them that they should not make him known:
Matthew|12|17|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
Matthew|12|18|Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;                   My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:                   I will put my Spirit upon him,                   And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.
Matthew|12|19|He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;                   Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
Matthew|12|20|A bruised reed shall he not break,                   And smoking flax shall he not quench,                   Till he send forth judgment unto victory.
Matthew|12|21|And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
Matthew|12|22|Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw.
Matthew|12|23|And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David?
Matthew|12|24|But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
Matthew|12|25|And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:
Matthew|12|26|and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
Matthew|12|27|And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
Matthew|12|28|But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.
Matthew|12|29|Or how can one enter into the house of the strong {man,} and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong {man}? and then he will spoil his house.
Matthew|12|30|He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
Matthew|12|31|Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
Matthew|12|32|And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.
Matthew|12|33|Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.
Matthew|12|34|Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
Matthew|12|35|The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
Matthew|12|36|And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
Matthew|12|37|For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
Matthew|12|38|Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.
Matthew|12|39|But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet:
Matthew|12|40|for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew|12|41|The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
Matthew|12|42|The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Matthew|12|43|But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.
Matthew|12|44|Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
Matthew|12|45|Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.
Matthew|12|46|While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
Matthew|12|47|And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
Matthew|12|48|But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
Matthew|12|49|And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Matthew|12|50|For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Matthew|13|1|On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
Matthew|13|2|And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
Matthew|13|3|And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
Matthew|13|4|and as he sowed, some {seeds} fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:
Matthew|13|5|and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:
Matthew|13|6|and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Matthew|13|7|And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:
Matthew|13|8|and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew|13|9|He that hath ears, let him hear.
Matthew|13|10|And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
Matthew|13|11|And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
Matthew|13|12|For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Matthew|13|13|Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
Matthew|13|14|And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,             By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;                   And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
Matthew|13|15|For this people’s heart is waxed gross,                   And their ears are dull of hearing,                   And their eyes they have closed;                   Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,                   And hear with their ears,                   And understand with their heart,                   And should turn again,                   And I should heal them.
Matthew|13|16|But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
Matthew|13|17|For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
Matthew|13|18|Hear then ye the parable of the sower.
Matthew|13|19|When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, {then} cometh the evil {one}, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.
Matthew|13|20|And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;
Matthew|13|21|yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.
Matthew|13|22|And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
Matthew|13|23|And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
Matthew|13|24|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:
Matthew|13|25|but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
Matthew|13|26|But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
Matthew|13|27|And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?
Matthew|13|28|And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
Matthew|13|29|But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.
Matthew|13|30|Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
Matthew|13|31|Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:
Matthew|13|32|which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.
Matthew|13|33|Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
Matthew|13|34|All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:
Matthew|13|35|that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,             I will open my mouth in parables;                   I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
Matthew|13|36|Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
Matthew|13|37|And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
Matthew|13|38|and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil {one};
Matthew|13|39|and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew|13|40|As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
Matthew|13|41|The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,
Matthew|13|42|and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|43|Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.
Matthew|13|44|The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
Matthew|13|45|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:
Matthew|13|46|and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
Matthew|13|47|Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
Matthew|13|48|which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.
Matthew|13|49|So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,
Matthew|13|50|and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|51|Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.
Matthew|13|52|And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Matthew|13|53|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.
Matthew|13|54|And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
Matthew|13|55|Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
Matthew|13|56|And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
Matthew|13|57|And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
Matthew|13|58|And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew|14|1|At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
Matthew|14|2|and said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.
Matthew|14|3|For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
Matthew|14|4|For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
Matthew|14|5|And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
Matthew|14|6|But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Matthew|14|7|Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.
Matthew|14|8|And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Matthew|14|9|And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given;
Matthew|14|10|and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew|14|11|And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew|14|12|And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told Jesus.
Matthew|14|13|Now when Jesus heard {it}, he withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard {thereof,} they followed him on foot from the cities.
Matthew|14|14|And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
Matthew|14|15|And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
Matthew|14|16|But Jesus said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.
Matthew|14|17|And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
Matthew|14|18|And he said, Bring them hither to me.
Matthew|14|19|And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|14|20|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
Matthew|14|21|And they that did eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew|14|22|And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.
Matthew|14|23|And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.
Matthew|14|24|But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
Matthew|14|25|And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
Matthew|14|26|And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
Matthew|14|27|But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
Matthew|14|28|And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
Matthew|14|29|And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
Matthew|14|30|But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
Matthew|14|31|And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
Matthew|14|32|And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Matthew|14|33|And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
Matthew|14|34|And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.
Matthew|14|35|And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick,
Matthew|14|36|and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.
Matthew|15|1|Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,
Matthew|15|2|Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew|15|3|And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Matthew|15|4|For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.
Matthew|15|5|But ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given {to God};
Matthew|15|6|he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.
Matthew|15|7|Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
Matthew|15|8|This people honoreth me with their lips;                   But their heart is far from me.
Matthew|15|9|But in vain do they worship me,                   Teaching {as their} doctrines the precepts of men.
Matthew|15|10|And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
Matthew|15|11|Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.
Matthew|15|12|Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?
Matthew|15|13|But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.
Matthew|15|14|Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.
Matthew|15|15|And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.
Matthew|15|16|And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?
Matthew|15|17|Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
Matthew|15|18|But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew|15|19|For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:
Matthew|15|20|these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.
Matthew|15|21|And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew|15|22|And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
Matthew|15|23|But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
Matthew|15|24|But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|15|25|But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
Matthew|15|26|And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
Matthew|15|27|But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
Matthew|15|28|Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
Matthew|15|29|And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.
Matthew|15|30|And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:
Matthew|15|31|insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew|15|32|And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.
Matthew|15|33|And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?
Matthew|15|34|And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.
Matthew|15|35|And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
Matthew|15|36|and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
Matthew|15|37|And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
Matthew|15|38|And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.
Matthew|15|39|And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.
Matthew|16|1|And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Matthew|16|2|But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, {It will be} fair weather: for the heaven is red.
Matthew|16|3|And in the morning, {It will be} foul weather to-day: for the heaven is red and lowering. Ye know how to discern the face of the heaven; but ye cannot {discern} the signs of the times.
Matthew|16|4|An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.
Matthew|16|5|And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.
Matthew|16|6|And Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|7|And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread.
Matthew|16|8|And Jesus perceiving it said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have no bread?
Matthew|16|9|Do ye not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|10|Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
Matthew|16|11|How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|12|Then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|13|Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is?
Matthew|16|14|And they said, Some {say} John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
Matthew|16|15|He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am?
Matthew|16|16|And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew|16|17|And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|16|18|And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
Matthew|16|19|I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|16|20|Then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ.
Matthew|16|21|From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples, that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
Matthew|16|22|And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall never be unto thee.
Matthew|16|23|But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art a stumbling-block unto me: for thou mindest not the things of God, but the things of men.
Matthew|16|24|Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
Matthew|16|25|For whosoever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew|16|26|For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?
Matthew|16|27|For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds.
Matthew|16|28|Verily I say unto you, there are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
Matthew|17|1|And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
Matthew|17|2|and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
Matthew|17|3|And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him.
Matthew|17|4|And Peter answered, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
Matthew|17|5|While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
Matthew|17|6|And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
Matthew|17|7|And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
Matthew|17|8|And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save Jesus only.
Matthew|17|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen from the dead.
Matthew|17|10|And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come?
Matthew|17|11|And he answered and said, Elijah indeed cometh, and shall restore all things:
Matthew|17|12|but I say unto you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them.
Matthew|17|13|Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
Matthew|17|14|And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, saying,
Matthew|17|15|Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and off-times into the water.
Matthew|17|16|And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
Matthew|17|17|And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
Matthew|17|18|And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.
Matthew|17|19|Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out?
Matthew|17|20|And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
Matthew|17|21|{But this kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting.}
Matthew|17|22|And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men;
Matthew|17|23|and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up. And they were exceeding sorry.
Matthew|17|24|And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel?
Matthew|17|25|He saith, Yea. And when he came into the house, Jesus spake first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers?
Matthew|17|26|And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.
Matthew|17|27|But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
Matthew|18|1|In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Matthew|18|2|And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,
Matthew|18|3|and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|4|Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|18|5|And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:
Matthew|18|6|But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and {that} he should be sunk in the depth of the sea.
Matthew|18|7|Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling! for it must needs be that the occasions come; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh!
Matthew|18|8|And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
Matthew|18|9|And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
Matthew|18|10|See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|11|{For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.}
Matthew|18|12|How think ye? if any man have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and go unto the mountains, and seek that which goeth astray?
Matthew|18|13|And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray.
Matthew|18|14|Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
Matthew|18|15|And if thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
Matthew|18|16|But if he hear {thee} not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established.
Matthew|18|17|And if he refuse to hear them, tell it unto the church: and if he refuse to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican.
Matthew|18|18|Verily I say unto you, what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew|18|19|Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.
Matthew|18|20|For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
Matthew|18|21|Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times?
Matthew|18|22|Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven.
Matthew|18|23|Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, who would make a reckoning with his servants.
Matthew|18|24|And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, that owed him ten thousand talents.
Matthew|18|25|But forasmuch as he had not {wherewith} to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
Matthew|18|26|The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
Matthew|18|27|And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
Matthew|18|28|But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred shillings: and he laid hold on him, and took {him} by the throat, saying, Pay what thou owest.
Matthew|18|29|So his fellow-servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
Matthew|18|30|And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which was due.
Matthew|18|31|So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
Matthew|18|32|Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me:
Matthew|18|33|shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?
Matthew|18|34|And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due.
Matthew|18|35|So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.
Matthew|19|1|And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
Matthew|19|2|and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.
Matthew|19|3|And there came unto him Pharisees, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful {for a man} to put away his wife for every cause?
Matthew|19|4|And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made {them} from the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew|19|5|and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?
Matthew|19|6|So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
Matthew|19|7|They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put {her} away?
Matthew|19|8|He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.
Matthew|19|9|And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.
Matthew|19|10|The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
Matthew|19|11|But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.
Matthew|19|12|For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
Matthew|19|13|Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew|19|14|But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|15|And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
Matthew|19|16|And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
Matthew|19|17|And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew|19|18|He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Matthew|19|19|Honor thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|19|20|The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?
Matthew|19|21|Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
Matthew|19|22|But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.
Matthew|19|23|And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Matthew|19|24|And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew|19|25|And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?
Matthew|19|26|And Jesus looking upon {them} said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
Matthew|19|27|Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?
Matthew|19|28|And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew|19|29|And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
Matthew|19|30|But many shall be last {that are} first; and first {that are} last.
Matthew|20|1|For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|2|And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|3|And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing in the marketplace idle;
Matthew|20|4|and to them he said, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Matthew|20|5|Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
Matthew|20|6|And about the eleventh {hour} he went out, and found others standing; and he saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
Matthew|20|7|They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard.
Matthew|20|8|And when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
Matthew|20|9|And when they came that {were hired} about the eleventh hour, they received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|10|And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received every man a shilling.
Matthew|20|11|And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,
Matthew|20|12|saying, These last have spent {but} one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
Matthew|20|13|But he answered and said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a shilling?
Matthew|20|14|Take up that which is thine, and go thy way; it is my will to give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Matthew|20|15|Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good?
Matthew|20|16|So the last shall be first, and the first last.
Matthew|20|17|And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples apart, and on the way he said unto them,
Matthew|20|18|Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death,
Matthew|20|19|and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify: and the third day he shall be raised up.
Matthew|20|20|Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping {him}, and asking a certain thing of him.
Matthew|20|21|And he said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Command that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy kingdom.
Matthew|20|22|But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say unto him, We are able.
Matthew|20|23|He saith unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink: but to sit on my right hand, and on {my} left hand, is not mine to give; but {it is for them} for whom it hath been prepared of my Father.
Matthew|20|24|And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren.
Matthew|20|25|But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Matthew|20|26|Not so shall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister;
Matthew|20|27|and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant:
Matthew|20|28|even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
Matthew|20|29|And as they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
Matthew|20|30|And behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|31|And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold their peace: but they cried out the more, saying, Lord, have mercy on us, thou son of David.
Matthew|20|32|And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?
Matthew|20|33|They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew|20|34|And Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and straightway they received their sight, and followed him.
Matthew|21|1|And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
Matthew|21|2|saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose {them}, and bring {them} unto me.
Matthew|21|3|And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
Matthew|21|4|Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
Matthew|21|5|Tell ye the daughter of Zion,                   Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,                   Meek, and riding upon an ass,                   And upon a colt the foal of an ass.
Matthew|21|6|And the disciples went, and did even as Jesus appointed them,
Matthew|21|7|and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.
Matthew|21|8|And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.
Matthew|21|9|And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
Matthew|21|10|And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?
Matthew|21|11|And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew|21|12|And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;
Matthew|21|13|and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.
Matthew|21|14|And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
Matthew|21|15|But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were moved with indignation,
Matthew|21|16|and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise?
Matthew|21|17|And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
Matthew|21|18|Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.
Matthew|21|19|And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.
Matthew|21|20|And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away?
Matthew|21|21|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.
Matthew|21|22|And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
Matthew|21|23|And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Matthew|21|24|And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|25|The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him?
Matthew|21|26|But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew|21|27|And they answered Jesus, and said, We know not. He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|28|But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.
Matthew|21|29|And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.
Matthew|21|30|And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I {go}, sir: and went not.
Matthew|21|31|Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew|21|32|For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.
Matthew|21|33|Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
Matthew|21|34|And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.
Matthew|21|35|And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew|21|36|Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.
Matthew|21|37|But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
Matthew|21|38|But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.
Matthew|21|39|And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
Matthew|21|40|When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
Matthew|21|41|They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Matthew|21|42|Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,             The stone which the builders rejected,                   The same was made the head of the corner;                   This was from the Lord,                   And it is marvelous in our eyes?
Matthew|21|43|Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
Matthew|21|44|And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
Matthew|21|45|And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
Matthew|21|46|And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.
Matthew|22|1|And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,
Matthew|22|2|The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
Matthew|22|3|and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
Matthew|22|4|Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|5|But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise;
Matthew|22|6|and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
Matthew|22|7|But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
Matthew|22|8|Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.
Matthew|22|9|Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
Matthew|22|10|And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
Matthew|22|11|But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment:
Matthew|22|12|and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
Matthew|22|13|Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|22|14|For many are called, but few chosen.
Matthew|22|15|Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in {his} talk.
Matthew|22|16|And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Matthew|22|17|Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
Matthew|22|18|But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites?
Matthew|22|19|Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a denarius.
Matthew|22|20|And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
Matthew|22|21|They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
Matthew|22|22|And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.
Matthew|22|23|On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,
Matthew|22|24|saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Matthew|22|25|Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;
Matthew|22|26|in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
Matthew|22|27|And after them all, the woman died.
Matthew|22|28|In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Matthew|22|29|But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
Matthew|22|30|For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
Matthew|22|31|But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
Matthew|22|32|I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not {the God} of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew|22|33|And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
Matthew|22|34|But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.
Matthew|22|35|And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him:
Matthew|22|36|Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew|22|37|And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
Matthew|22|38|This is the great and first commandment.
Matthew|22|39|And a second like {unto it} is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Matthew|22|40|On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.
Matthew|22|41|Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
Matthew|22|42|saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, {The son} of David.
Matthew|22|43|He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
Matthew|22|44|The Lord said unto my Lord,                   Sit thou on my right hand,                   Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?
Matthew|22|45|If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
Matthew|22|46|And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
Matthew|23|1|Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples,
Matthew|23|2|saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses seat:
Matthew|23|3|all things therefore whatsoever they bid you, {these} do and observe: but do not ye after their works; for they say, and do not.
Matthew|23|4|Yea, they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.
Matthew|23|5|But all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders {of their garments},
Matthew|23|6|and love the chief place at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
Matthew|23|7|and the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called of men, Rabbi.
Matthew|23|8|But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your teacher, and all ye are brethren.
Matthew|23|9|And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, {even} he who is in heaven.
Matthew|23|10|Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, {even} the Christ.
Matthew|23|11|But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew|23|12|And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.
Matthew|23|13|But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter{.}
Matthew|23|14|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, even while for a pretence ye make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation.
Matthew|23|15|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is become so, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
Matthew|23|16|Woe unto you, ye blind guides, that say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
Matthew|23|17|Ye fools and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?
Matthew|23|18|And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.
Matthew|23|19|Ye blind: for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Matthew|23|20|He therefore that sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
Matthew|23|21|And he that sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
Matthew|23|22|And he that sweareth by the heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
Matthew|23|23|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law, justice, and mercy, and faith: but these ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other undone.
Matthew|23|24|Ye blind guides, that strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel!
Matthew|23|25|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full from extortion and excess.
Matthew|23|26|Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside thereof may become clean also.
Matthew|23|27|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
Matthew|23|28|Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Matthew|23|29|Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and garnish the tombs of the righteous,
Matthew|23|30|and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Matthew|23|31|Wherefore ye witness to yourselves, that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets.
Matthew|23|32|Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Matthew|23|33|Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of hell?
Matthew|23|34|Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: some of them shall ye kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city:
Matthew|23|35|that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar.
Matthew|23|36|Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Matthew|23|37|O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killeth the prophets, and stoneth them that are sent unto her! how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Matthew|23|38|Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
Matthew|23|39|For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed {is} he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
Matthew|24|1|And Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew|24|2|But he answered and said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Matthew|24|3|And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what {shall be} the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
Matthew|24|4|And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man lead you astray.
Matthew|24|5|For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray.
Matthew|24|6|And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled: for {these things} must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet.
Matthew|24|7|For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places.
Matthew|24|8|But all these things are the beginning of travail.
Matthew|24|9|Then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name’s sake.
Matthew|24|10|And then shall many stumble, and shall deliver up one another, and shall hate one another.
Matthew|24|11|And many false prophets shall arise, and shall lead many astray.
Matthew|24|12|And because iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold.
Matthew|24|13|But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.
Matthew|24|14|And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations; and then shall the end come.
Matthew|24|15|When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),
Matthew|24|16|then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains:
Matthew|24|17|let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house:
Matthew|24|18|and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak.
Matthew|24|19|But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days!
Matthew|24|20|And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on a sabbath:
Matthew|24|21|for then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.
Matthew|24|22|And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
Matthew|24|23|Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ, or, Here; believe {it} not.
Matthew|24|24|For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Matthew|24|25|Behold, I have told you beforehand.
Matthew|24|26|If therefore they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the wilderness; go not forth: Behold, he is in the inner chambers; believe {it} not.
Matthew|24|27|For as the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|28|Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
Matthew|24|29|But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
Matthew|24|30|and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew|24|31|And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Matthew|24|32|Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh;
Matthew|24|33|even so ye also, when ye see all these things, know ye that he is nigh, {even} at the doors.
Matthew|24|34|Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished.
Matthew|24|35|Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
Matthew|24|36|But of that day and hour knoweth no one, not even the angels of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father only.
Matthew|24|37|And as {were} the days of Noah, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|38|For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
Matthew|24|39|and they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall be the coming of the Son of man.
Matthew|24|40|Then shall two man be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:
Matthew|24|41|two women {shall be} grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.
Matthew|24|42|Watch therefore: for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh.
Matthew|24|43|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through.
Matthew|24|44|Therefore be ye also ready; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Matthew|24|45|Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their food in due season?
Matthew|24|46|Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Matthew|24|47|Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all that he hath.
Matthew|24|48|But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord tarrieth;
Matthew|24|49|and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall eat and drink with the drunken;
Matthew|24|50|the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not, and in an hour when he knoweth not,
Matthew|24|51|and shall cut him asunder, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|25|1|Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew|25|2|And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
Matthew|25|3|For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:
Matthew|25|4|but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew|25|5|Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew|25|6|But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.
Matthew|25|7|Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew|25|8|And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.
Matthew|25|9|But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew|25|10|And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.
Matthew|25|11|Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
Matthew|25|12|But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Matthew|25|13|Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.
Matthew|25|14|For {it is} as {when} a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
Matthew|25|15|And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.
Matthew|25|16|Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.
Matthew|25|17|In like manner he also that {received} the two gained other two.
Matthew|25|18|But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
Matthew|25|19|Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.
Matthew|25|20|And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.
Matthew|25|21|His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew|25|22|And he also that {received} the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.
Matthew|25|23|His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Matthew|25|24|And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;
Matthew|25|25|and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.
Matthew|25|26|But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;
Matthew|25|27|thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.
Matthew|25|28|Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.
Matthew|25|29|For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.
Matthew|25|30|And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|25|31|But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:
Matthew|25|32|and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;
Matthew|25|33|and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Matthew|25|34|Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Matthew|25|35|for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
Matthew|25|36|naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Matthew|25|37|Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?
Matthew|25|38|And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Matthew|25|39|And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Matthew|25|40|And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, {even} these least, ye did it unto me.
Matthew|25|41|Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:
Matthew|25|42|for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
Matthew|25|43|I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Matthew|25|44|Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Matthew|25|45|Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.
Matthew|25|46|And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.
Matthew|26|1|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,
Matthew|26|2|Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
Matthew|26|3|Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;
Matthew|26|4|and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.
Matthew|26|5|But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.
Matthew|26|6|Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew|26|7|there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.
Matthew|26|8|But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
Matthew|26|9|For this {ointment} might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
Matthew|26|10|But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
Matthew|26|11|For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
Matthew|26|12|For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
Matthew|26|13|Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
Matthew|26|14|Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
Matthew|26|15|and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew|26|16|And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him {unto them.}
Matthew|26|17|Now on the first {day} of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?
Matthew|26|18|And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
Matthew|26|19|And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
Matthew|26|20|Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;
Matthew|26|21|and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
Matthew|26|22|And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?
Matthew|26|23|And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
Matthew|26|24|The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
Matthew|26|25|And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.
Matthew|26|26|And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
Matthew|26|27|And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
Matthew|26|28|for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.
Matthew|26|29|But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
Matthew|26|30|And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.
Matthew|26|31|Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
Matthew|26|32|But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew|26|33|But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.
Matthew|26|34|Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Matthew|26|35|Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, {yet} will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
Matthew|26|36|Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.
Matthew|26|37|And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.
Matthew|26|38|Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.
Matthew|26|39|And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
Matthew|26|40|And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Matthew|26|41|Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Matthew|26|42|Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.
Matthew|26|43|And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew|26|44|And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.
Matthew|26|45|Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Matthew|26|46|Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.
Matthew|26|47|And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.
Matthew|26|48|Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.
Matthew|26|49|And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
Matthew|26|50|And Jesus said unto him, Friend, {do} that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Matthew|26|51|And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
Matthew|26|52|Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Matthew|26|53|Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew|26|54|How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?
Matthew|26|55|In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.
Matthew|26|56|But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
Matthew|26|57|And they that had taken Jesus led him away to {the house of} Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
Matthew|26|58|But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.
Matthew|26|59|Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;
Matthew|26|60|and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,
Matthew|26|61|and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
Matthew|26|62|And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
Matthew|26|63|But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew|26|64|Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Matthew|26|65|Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:
Matthew|26|66|what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
Matthew|26|67|Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,
Matthew|26|68|saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?
Matthew|26|69|Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.
Matthew|26|70|But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
Matthew|26|71|And when he was gone out into the porch, another {maid} saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
Matthew|26|72|And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
Matthew|26|73|And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art {one} of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.
Matthew|26|74|Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.
Matthew|26|75|And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Matthew|27|1|Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
Matthew|27|2|and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.
Matthew|27|3|Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew|27|4|saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? see thou {to it}.
Matthew|27|5|And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew|27|6|And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.
Matthew|27|7|And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Matthew|27|8|Wherefore that field was called, the field of blood, unto this day.
Matthew|27|9|Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom {certain} of the children of Israel did price;
Matthew|27|10|and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
Matthew|27|11|Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
Matthew|27|12|And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Matthew|27|13|Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
Matthew|27|14|And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Matthew|27|15|Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
Matthew|27|16|And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Matthew|27|17|When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
Matthew|27|18|For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
Matthew|27|19|And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
Matthew|27|20|Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
Matthew|27|21|But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
Matthew|27|22|Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|23|And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.
Matthew|27|24|So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye {to it}.
Matthew|27|25|And all the people answered and said, His blood {be} on us, and on our children.
Matthew|27|26|Then released he unto them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.
Matthew|27|27|Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.
Matthew|27|28|And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
Matthew|27|29|And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
Matthew|27|30|And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.
Matthew|27|31|And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.
Matthew|27|32|And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go {with them}, that he might bear his cross.
Matthew|27|33|And they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull,
Matthew|27|34|they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
Matthew|27|35|And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;
Matthew|27|36|and they sat and watched him there.
Matthew|27|37|And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew|27|38|Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
Matthew|27|39|And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
Matthew|27|40|and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Matthew|27|41|In like manner also the chief priests mocking {him}, with the scribes and elders, said,
Matthew|27|42|He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
Matthew|27|43|He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew|27|44|And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach.
Matthew|27|45|Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew|27|46|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Matthew|27|47|And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.
Matthew|27|48|And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
Matthew|27|49|And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.
Matthew|27|50|And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Matthew|27|51|And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;
Matthew|27|52|and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;
Matthew|27|53|and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
Matthew|27|54|Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew|27|55|And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Matthew|27|56|among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew|27|57|And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
Matthew|27|58|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
Matthew|27|59|And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Matthew|27|60|and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
Matthew|27|61|And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Matthew|27|62|Now on the morrow, which is {the day} after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,
Matthew|27|63|saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
Matthew|27|64|Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
Matthew|27|65|Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it {as} sure as ye can.
Matthew|27|66|So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.
Matthew|28|1|Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first {day} of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
Matthew|28|2|And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.
Matthew|28|3|His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
Matthew|28|4|and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.
Matthew|28|5|And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.
Matthew|28|6|He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Matthew|28|7|And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
Matthew|28|8|And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.
Matthew|28|9|And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.
Matthew|28|10|Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
Matthew|28|11|Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.
Matthew|28|12|And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,
Matthew|28|13|saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
Matthew|28|14|And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.
Matthew|28|15|So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, {and continueth} until this day.
Matthew|28|16|But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
Matthew|28|17|And when they saw him, they worshipped {him}; but some doubted.
Matthew|28|18|And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.
Matthew|28|19|Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:
Matthew|28|20|teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
Ezekiel|1|1|Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
Ezekiel|1|2|In the fifth {day} of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,
Ezekiel|1|3|the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.
Ezekiel|1|4|And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
Ezekiel|1|5|And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
Ezekiel|1|6|And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
Ezekiel|1|7|And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.
Ezekiel|1|8|And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings {thus}:
Ezekiel|1|9|their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel|1|10|As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|1|11|And their faces and their wings were separate above; two {wings} of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|12|And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|13|As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: {the fire} went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
Ezekiel|1|14|And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
Ezekiel|1|15|Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.
Ezekiel|1|16|The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
Ezekiel|1|17|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.
Ezekiel|1|18|As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
Ezekiel|1|19|And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
Ezekiel|1|20|Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel|1|21|When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
Ezekiel|1|22|And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.
Ezekiel|1|23|And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
Ezekiel|1|24|And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|25|And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
Ezekiel|1|26|And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.
Ezekiel|1|27|And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
Ezekiel|1|28|As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
Ezekiel|2|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
Ezekiel|2|2|And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.
Ezekiel|2|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.
Ezekiel|2|4|And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do sent thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|2|5|And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
Ezekiel|2|6|And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|2|7|And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
Ezekiel|2|8|But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.
Ezekiel|2|9|And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;
Ezekiel|2|10|And he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
Ezekiel|3|1|And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|3|2|So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.
Ezekiel|3|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
Ezekiel|3|4|And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
Ezekiel|3|5|For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
Ezekiel|3|6|not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.
Ezekiel|3|7|But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
Ezekiel|3|8|Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
Ezekiel|3|9|As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|10|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
Ezekiel|3|11|And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
Ezekiel|3|12|Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, {saying}, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
Ezekiel|3|13|And {I heard} the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
Ezekiel|3|14|So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
Ezekiel|3|15|Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
Ezekiel|3|16|And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|3|17|Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
Ezekiel|3|18|When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|19|Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|20|Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|3|21|Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|3|22|And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
Ezekiel|3|23|Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Ezekiel|3|24|Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
Ezekiel|3|25|But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
Ezekiel|3|26|and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|3|27|But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|4|1|Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:
Ezekiel|4|2|and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.
Ezekiel|4|3|And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|4|Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; {according to} the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|4|5|For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|4|6|And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.
Ezekiel|4|7|And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.
Ezekiel|4|8|And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.
Ezekiel|4|9|Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; {according to} the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.
Ezekiel|4|10|And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
Ezekiel|4|11|And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
Ezekiel|4|12|And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.
Ezekiel|4|13|And Jehovah said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.
Ezekiel|4|14|Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! behold, my soul hath not been polluted; for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
Ezekiel|4|15|Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.
Ezekiel|4|16|Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay:
Ezekiel|4|17|that they may want bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
Ezekiel|5|1|And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword; {as} a barber’s razor shalt thou take it unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
Ezekiel|5|2|A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|3|And thou shalt take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
Ezekiel|5|4|And of these again shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|5|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.
Ezekiel|5|6|And she hath rebelled against mine ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have rejected mine ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.
Ezekiel|5|7|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are turbulent more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept mine ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;
Ezekiel|5|8|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee; and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|5|9|And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|5|10|Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on thee; and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter unto all the winds.
Ezekiel|5|11|Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish {thee}; neither shall mine eye spare, and I also will have no pity.
Ezekiel|5|12|A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a third part I will scatter unto all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
Ezekiel|5|13|Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|5|14|Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
Ezekiel|5|15|So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes; (I, Jehovah, have spoken it;)
Ezekiel|5|16|when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread;
Ezekiel|5|17|and I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|6|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|6|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy unto them,
Ezekiel|6|3|and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
Ezekiel|6|4|And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.
Ezekiel|6|5|And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
Ezekiel|6|6|In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.
Ezekiel|6|7|And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|6|8|Yet will I leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
Ezekiel|6|9|And those of you that escape shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captive, how that I have been broken with their lewd heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
Ezekiel|6|10|And they shall know that I am Jehovah: I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.
Ezekiel|6|11|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Ezekiel|6|12|He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my wrath upon them.
Ezekiel|6|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.
Ezekiel|6|14|And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|7|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|7|2|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
Ezekiel|7|3|Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|4|And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|7|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|6|An end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.
Ezekiel|7|7|Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near, {a day of} tumult, and not {of} joyful shouting, upon the mountains.
Ezekiel|7|8|Now will I shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|7|9|And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways; and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.
Ezekiel|7|10|Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
Ezekiel|7|11|Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them {shall remain}, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.
Ezekiel|7|12|The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|13|For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
Ezekiel|7|14|They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
Ezekiel|7|15|The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword: and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
Ezekiel|7|16|But those of them that escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|17|All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
Ezekiel|7|18|They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
Ezekiel|7|19|They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
Ezekiel|7|20|As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations {and} their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.
Ezekiel|7|21|And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.
Ezekiel|7|22|My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret {place}; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.
Ezekiel|7|23|Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
Ezekiel|7|24|Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
Ezekiel|7|25|Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
Ezekiel|7|26|Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
Ezekiel|7|27|The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|8|1|And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
Ezekiel|8|2|Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
Ezekiel|8|3|And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner {court} that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
Ezekiel|8|4|And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
Ezekiel|8|5|Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
Ezekiel|8|6|And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but thou shalt again see yet other great abominations.
Ezekiel|8|7|And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
Ezekiel|8|8|Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold, a door.
Ezekiel|8|9|And he said unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.
Ezekiel|8|10|So I went in and saw; and behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.
Ezekiel|8|11|And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.
Ezekiel|8|12|Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? for they say, Jehovah seeth us not; Jehovah hath forsaken the land.
Ezekiel|8|13|He said also unto me, Thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do.
Ezekiel|8|14|Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah’s house which was toward the north; and behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.
Ezekiel|8|15|Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these.
Ezekiel|8|16|And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah’s house; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east.
Ezekiel|8|17|Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen {this}, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.
Ezekiel|8|18|Therefore will I also deal in wrath; mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
Ezekiel|9|1|Then he cried in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
Ezekiel|9|2|And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
Ezekiel|9|3|And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.
Ezekiel|9|4|And Jehovah said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|9|5|And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;
Ezekiel|9|6|slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark: and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men that were before the house.
Ezekiel|9|7|And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.
Ezekiel|9|8|And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
Ezekiel|9|9|Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wrestling {of judgment}: for they say, Jehovah hath forsaken the land, and Jehovah seeth not.
Ezekiel|9|10|And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.
Ezekiel|9|11|And behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.
Ezekiel|10|1|Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
Ezekiel|10|2|And he spake unto the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling {wheels}, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.
Ezekiel|10|3|Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
Ezekiel|10|4|And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, {and stood} over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah’s glory.
Ezekiel|10|5|And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaketh.
Ezekiel|10|6|And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|7|And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took {thereof}, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
Ezekiel|10|8|And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|9|And I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like unto a beryl stone.
Ezekiel|10|10|And as for their appearance, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.
Ezekiel|10|11|When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
Ezekiel|10|12|And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, {even} the wheels that they four had.
Ezekiel|10|13|As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, the whirling {wheels}.
Ezekiel|10|14|And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
Ezekiel|10|15|And the cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
Ezekiel|10|16|And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also turned not from beside them.
Ezekiel|10|17|When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
Ezekiel|10|18|And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|19|And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|10|20|This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
Ezekiel|10|21|Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
Ezekiel|10|22|And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.
Ezekiel|11|1|Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Jehovah’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold, at the door of the gate five and twenty men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.
Ezekiel|11|2|And he said unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise iniquity, and that give wicked counsel in this city;
Ezekiel|11|3|that say, {The time} is not near to build houses: this {city} is the caldron, and we are the flesh.
Ezekiel|11|4|Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
Ezekiel|11|5|And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and he said unto me, Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Thus have ye said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
Ezekiel|11|6|Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
Ezekiel|11|7|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this {city} is the caldron; but ye shall be brought forth out of the midst of it.
Ezekiel|11|8|Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|9|And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.
Ezekiel|11|10|Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|11|This {city} shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; I will judge you in the border of Israel;
Ezekiel|11|12|and ye shall know that I am Jehovah: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither have ye executed mine ordinances, but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you.
Ezekiel|11|13|And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
Ezekiel|11|14|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|11|15|Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, {are they} unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.
Ezekiel|11|16|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.
Ezekiel|11|17|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|11|18|And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.
Ezekiel|11|19|And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;
Ezekiel|11|20|that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|11|21|But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|11|22|Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
Ezekiel|11|23|And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
Ezekiel|11|24|And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
Ezekiel|11|25|Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had showed me.
Ezekiel|12|1|The word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|2|Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of the rebellious house, that have eyes to see, and see not, that have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|3|Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel|12|4|And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing; and thou shalt go forth thyself at even in their sight, as when men go forth into exile.
Ezekiel|12|5|Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
Ezekiel|12|6|In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulder, and carry it forth in the dark; thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the land: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|7|And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the dark, and bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
Ezekiel|12|8|And in the morning came the word of Jehovah unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|9|Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
Ezekiel|12|10|Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This burden {concerneth} the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel among whom they are.
Ezekiel|12|11|Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
Ezekiel|12|12|And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, because he shall not see the land with his eyes.
Ezekiel|12|13|My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
Ezekiel|12|14|And I will scatter toward every wind all that are round about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
Ezekiel|12|15|And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
Ezekiel|12|16|But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they come; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|17|Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|18|Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness;
Ezekiel|12|19|and say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, {and despoiled} of all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
Ezekiel|12|20|And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|21|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|22|Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
Ezekiel|12|23|Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision.
Ezekiel|12|24|For there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|12|25|For I am Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed; it shall be no more deferred: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|12|26|Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,
Ezekiel|12|27|Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many day to come, and he prophesieth of times that are far off.
Ezekiel|12|28|Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|13|2|Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|13|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
Ezekiel|13|4|O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
Ezekiel|13|5|Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|6|They have seen falsehood and lying divination, that say, Jehovah saith; but Jehovah hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.
Ezekiel|13|7|Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah saith; albeit I have not spoken?
Ezekiel|13|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|9|And my hand shall be against the prophets that see false visions, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|10|Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered {mortar}:
Ezekiel|13|11|say unto them that daub it with untempered {mortar}, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
Ezekiel|13|12|Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
Ezekiel|13|13|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
Ezekiel|13|14|So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered {mortar}, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|15|Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered {mortar}; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
Ezekiel|13|16|{to wit}, the prophets of Israel that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|17|And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
Ezekiel|13|18|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of {persons of} every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
Ezekiel|13|19|And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.
Ezekiel|13|20|Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make {them} fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make {them} fly.
Ezekiel|13|21|Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|13|22|Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:
Ezekiel|13|23|Therefore ye shall no more see false visions, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|1|Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|14|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|3|Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?
Ezekiel|14|4|Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I Jehovah will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;
Ezekiel|14|5|that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
Ezekiel|14|6|Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
Ezekiel|14|7|For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I Jehovah will answer him by myself:
Ezekiel|14|8|and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|9|And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, Jehovah, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
Ezekiel|14|10|And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh {unto him};
Ezekiel|14|11|that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|12|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|14|13|Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|14|though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|14|15|If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts;
Ezekiel|14|16|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only should be delivered, but the land should be desolate.
Ezekiel|14|17|Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|18|though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only should be delivered themselves.
Ezekiel|14|19|Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast;
Ezekiel|14|20|though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, they should deliver neither son nor daughter; they should but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
Ezekiel|14|21|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!
Ezekiel|14|22|Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
Ezekiel|14|23|And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|15|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|15|2|Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
Ezekiel|15|3|Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
Ezekiel|15|4|Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work?
Ezekiel|15|5|Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!
Ezekiel|15|6|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel|15|7|And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set my face against them.
Ezekiel|15|8|And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|1|Again the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|16|2|Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations;
Ezekiel|16|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem: Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, and thy mother was a Hittite.
Ezekiel|16|4|And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
Ezekiel|16|5|No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, for that thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou wast born.
Ezekiel|16|6|And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy blood, I said unto thee, {Though thou art} in thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, {Though thou art} in thy blood, live.
Ezekiel|16|7|I caused thee to multiply as that which groweth in the field, and thou didst increase and wax great, and thou attainedst to excellent ornament; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet thou wast naked and bare.
Ezekiel|16|8|Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou becamest mine.
Ezekiel|16|9|Then washed I thee with water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
Ezekiel|16|10|I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with sealskin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and covered thee with silk.
Ezekiel|16|11|And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
Ezekiel|16|12|And I put a ring upon thy nose, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
Ezekiel|16|13|Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper unto royal estate.
Ezekiel|16|14|And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|15|But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by; his it was.
Ezekiel|16|16|And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thee high places decked with divers colors, and playedst the harlot upon them: {the like things} shall not come, neither shall it be {so}.
Ezekiel|16|17|Thou didst also take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of men, and didst play the harlot with them;
Ezekiel|16|18|and thou tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them, and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
Ezekiel|16|19|My bread also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savor; and {thus} it was, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|20|Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
Ezekiel|16|21|that thou hast slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through {the fire} unto them?
Ezekiel|16|22|And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast weltering in thy blood.
Ezekiel|16|23|And it is come to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah,)
Ezekiel|16|24|that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place, and hast made thee a lofty place in every street.
Ezekiel|16|25|Thou hast built thy lofty place at the head of every way, and hast made thy beauty an abomination, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredom.
Ezekiel|16|26|Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians, thy neighbors, great of flesh; and hast multiplied thy whoredom, to provoke me to anger.
Ezekiel|16|27|Behold therefore, I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary {food}, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, that are ashamed of thy lewd way.
Ezekiel|16|28|Thou hast played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet thou wast not satisfied.
Ezekiel|16|29|Thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
Ezekiel|16|30|How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an impudent harlot;
Ezekiel|16|31|in that thou buildest thy vaulted place at the head of every way, and makest thy lofty place in every street, and hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest hire.
Ezekiel|16|32|A wife that committeth adultery! that taketh strangers instead of her husband!
Ezekiel|16|33|They give gifts to all harlots; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and bribest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|16|34|And thou art different from {other} women in thy whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to play the harlot; and whereas thou givest hire, and no hire is given unto thee, therefore thou art different.
Ezekiel|16|35|Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|16|36|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness uncovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers; and because of all the idols of thy abominations, and for the blood of thy children, that thou didst give unto them;
Ezekiel|16|37|therefore behold, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them against thee on every side, and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
Ezekiel|16|38|And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy.
Ezekiel|16|39|I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thy vaulted place, and break down thy lofty places; and they shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take thy fair jewels; and they shall leave thee naked and bare.
Ezekiel|16|40|They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
Ezekiel|16|41|And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire any more.
Ezekiel|16|42|So will I cause my wrath toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
Ezekiel|16|43|Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold, I also will bring thy way upon thy head, saith the Lord Jehovah: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness with all thine abominations.
Ezekiel|16|44|Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use {this} proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
Ezekiel|16|45|Thou art the daughter of thy mother, that loatheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
Ezekiel|16|46|And thine elder sister is Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
Ezekiel|16|47|Yet hast thou not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as {if that were} a very little {thing}, thou wast more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
Ezekiel|16|48|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
Ezekiel|16|49|Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fulness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
Ezekiel|16|50|And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw {good}.
Ezekiel|16|51|Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.
Ezekiel|16|52|Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
Ezekiel|16|53|And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;
Ezekiel|16|54|that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
Ezekiel|16|55|And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.
Ezekiel|16|56|For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,
Ezekiel|16|57|before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.
Ezekiel|16|58|Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.
Ezekiel|16|59|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
Ezekiel|16|60|Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.
Ezekiel|16|61|Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder {sisters} and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
Ezekiel|16|62|And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;
Ezekiel|16|63|that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|17|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|17|2|Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;
Ezekiel|17|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:
Ezekiel|17|4|he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it unto a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.
Ezekiel|17|5|He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow-tree.
Ezekiel|17|6|And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.
Ezekiel|17|7|There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
Ezekiel|17|8|It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
Ezekiel|17|9|Say thou, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? and not by a strong arm or much people can it be raised from the roots thereof.
Ezekiel|17|10|Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.
Ezekiel|17|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|17|12|Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon:
Ezekiel|17|13|and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;
Ezekiel|17|14|that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
Ezekiel|17|15|But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?
Ezekiel|17|16|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.
Ezekiel|17|17|Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.
Ezekiel|17|18|For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.
Ezekiel|17|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.
Ezekiel|17|20|And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.
Ezekiel|17|21|And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|17|22|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain:
Ezekiel|17|23|in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
Ezekiel|17|24|And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.
Ezekiel|18|1|The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Ezekiel|18|2|What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?
Ezekiel|18|3|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, ye shall not have {occasion} any more to use this proverb in Israel.
Ezekiel|18|4|Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
Ezekiel|18|5|But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,
Ezekiel|18|6|and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbor’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity,
Ezekiel|18|7|and hath not wronged any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
Ezekiel|18|8|he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,
Ezekiel|18|9|hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|18|10|If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth any one of these things,
Ezekiel|18|11|and that doeth not any of those {duties}, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor’s wife,
Ezekiel|18|12|hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,
Ezekiel|18|13|hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
Ezekiel|18|14|Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and feareth, and doeth not such like;
Ezekiel|18|15|that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbor’s wife,
Ezekiel|18|16|neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;
Ezekiel|18|17|that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed mine ordinances, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|18|18|As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.
Ezekiel|18|19|Yet say ye, Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|18|20|The soul that sinneth, it shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
Ezekiel|18|21|But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|18|22|None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.
Ezekiel|18|23|Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? saith the Lord Jehovah; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?
Ezekiel|18|24|But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
Ezekiel|18|25|Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?
Ezekiel|18|26|When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth therein; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.
Ezekiel|18|27|Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.
Ezekiel|18|28|Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|18|29|Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?
Ezekiel|18|30|Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
Ezekiel|18|31|Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel|18|32|For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord Jehovah: wherefore turn yourselves, and live.
Ezekiel|19|1|Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
Ezekiel|19|2|and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she couched among lions, in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps.
Ezekiel|19|3|And she brought up one of her whelps: he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
Ezekiel|19|4|The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|19|5|Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
Ezekiel|19|6|And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.
Ezekiel|19|7|And he knew their palaces, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.
Ezekiel|19|8|Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
Ezekiel|19|9|And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel|19|10|Thy mother was like a vine, in thy blood, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
Ezekiel|19|11|And it had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs, and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches.
Ezekiel|19|12|But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit: its strong rods were broken off and withered; the fire consumed them.
Ezekiel|19|13|And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
Ezekiel|19|14|And fire is gone out of the rods of its branches, it hath devoured its fruit, so that there is in it no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
Ezekiel|20|1|And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth {month}, the tenth {day} of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
Ezekiel|20|2|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|3|Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Is it to inquire of me that ye are come? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
Ezekiel|20|4|Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
Ezekiel|20|5|and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when I chose Israel, and sware unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I sware unto them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;
Ezekiel|20|6|in that day I sware unto them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.
Ezekiel|20|7|And I said unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|8|But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me; they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|9|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|20|10|So I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|11|And I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live in them.
Ezekiel|20|12|Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth them.
Ezekiel|20|13|But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they rejected mine ordinances, which if a man keep, he shall live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
Ezekiel|20|14|But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
Ezekiel|20|15|Moreover also I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;
Ezekiel|20|16|because they rejected mine ordinances, and walked not in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
Ezekiel|20|17|Nevertheless mine eye spared them, and I destroyed them not, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|18|And I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
Ezekiel|20|19|I am Jehovah your God: walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them;
Ezekiel|20|20|and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Ezekiel|20|21|But the children rebelled against me; they walked not in my statutes, neither kept mine ordinances to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them; they profaned my sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Ezekiel|20|22|Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought them forth.
Ezekiel|20|23|Moreover I sware unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the countries;
Ezekiel|20|24|because they had not executed mine ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
Ezekiel|20|25|Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live;
Ezekiel|20|26|and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through {the fire} all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|27|Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
Ezekiel|20|28|For when I had brought them into the land, which I sware to give unto them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made their sweet savor, and they poured out there their drink-offerings.
Ezekiel|20|29|Then I said unto them, What meaneth the high place whereunto ye go? So the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
Ezekiel|20|30|Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Do ye pollute yourselves after the manner of your fathers? and play ye the harlot after their abominations?
Ezekiel|20|31|and when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, do ye pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day? and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you;
Ezekiel|20|32|and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, in that ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
Ezekiel|20|33|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, will I be king over you:
Ezekiel|20|34|and I will bring you out from the peoples, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;
Ezekiel|20|35|and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face.
Ezekiel|20|36|Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|37|And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
Ezekiel|20|38|and I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me; I will bring them forth out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|39|As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Go ye, serve every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me; but my holy name shall ye no more profane with your gifts, and with your idols.
Ezekiel|20|40|For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve me in the land: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first-fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
Ezekiel|20|41|As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
Ezekiel|20|42|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I sware to give unto your fathers.
Ezekiel|20|43|And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
Ezekiel|20|44|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|20|45|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|20|46|Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop {thy word} toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the South;
Ezekiel|20|47|and say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burnt thereby.
Ezekiel|20|48|And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Ezekiel|20|49|Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?
Ezekiel|21|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|2|Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop {thy word} toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|21|3|and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
Ezekiel|21|4|Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
Ezekiel|21|5|and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
Ezekiel|21|6|Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.
Ezekiel|21|7|And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|8|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|21|9|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;
Ezekiel|21|10|it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.
Ezekiel|21|11|And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Ezekiel|21|12|Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.
Ezekiel|21|13|For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|21|14|Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.
Ezekiel|21|15|I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
Ezekiel|21|16|Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
Ezekiel|21|17|I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|21|18|The word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Ezekiel|21|19|Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
Ezekiel|21|20|Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
Ezekiel|21|21|For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.
Ezekiel|21|22|In his right hand was the divination {for} Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
Ezekiel|21|23|And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
Ezekiel|21|24|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
Ezekiel|21|25|And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,
Ezekiel|21|26|thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this {shall be} no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
Ezekiel|21|27|I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it {him}.
Ezekiel|21|28|And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;
Ezekiel|21|29|while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
Ezekiel|21|30|Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.
Ezekiel|21|31|And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.
Ezekiel|21|32|Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|22|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|2|And thou, son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? then cause her to know all her abominations.
Ezekiel|22|3|And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: A city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that maketh idols against herself to defile her!
Ezekiel|22|4|Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the countries.
Ezekiel|22|5|Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall mock thee, thou infamous one {and} full of tumult.
Ezekiel|22|6|Behold, the princes of Israel, every one according to his power, have been in thee to shed blood.
Ezekiel|22|7|In thee have they set light by father and mother; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the sojourner; in thee have they wronged the fatherless and the widow.
Ezekiel|22|8|Thou hast despised my holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|22|9|Slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness.
Ezekiel|22|10|In thee have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity.
Ezekiel|22|11|And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.
Ezekiel|22|12|In thee have they taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken interest and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by oppression, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|22|13|Behold, therefore, I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
Ezekiel|22|14|Can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and will do it.
Ezekiel|22|15|And I will scatter thee among the nations, and disperse thee through the countries; and I will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
Ezekiel|22|16|And thou shalt be profaned in thyself, in the sight of the nations; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|22|17|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|18|Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross unto me: all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
Ezekiel|22|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye are all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
Ezekiel|22|20|As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.
Ezekiel|22|21|Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|22|22|As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out my wrath upon you.
Ezekiel|22|23|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|22|24|Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
Ezekiel|22|25|There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey: they have devoured souls; they take treasure and precious things; they have made her widows many in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|22|26|Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
Ezekiel|22|27|Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, {and} to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.
Ezekiel|22|28|And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered {mortar}, seeing false visions, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah hath not spoken.
Ezekiel|22|29|The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery; yea, they have vexed the poor and needy, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.
Ezekiel|22|30|And I sought for a man among them, that should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none.
Ezekiel|22|31|Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I brought upon their heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|23|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|23|2|Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
Ezekiel|23|3|and they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.
Ezekiel|23|4|And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister: and they became mine, and they bare sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.
Ezekiel|23|5|And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians {her} neighbors,
Ezekiel|23|6|who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
Ezekiel|23|7|And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomsoever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.
Ezekiel|23|8|Neither hath she left her whoredoms since {the days of} Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity; and they poured out their whoredom upon her.
Ezekiel|23|9|Wherefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
Ezekiel|23|10|These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments upon her.
Ezekiel|23|11|And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.
Ezekiel|23|12|She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, {her} neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
Ezekiel|23|13|And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.
Ezekiel|23|14|And she increased her whoredoms; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,
Ezekiel|23|15|girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them princes to look upon, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
Ezekiel|23|16|And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
Ezekiel|23|17|And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.
Ezekiel|23|18|So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.
Ezekiel|23|19|Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|23|20|And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Ezekiel|23|21|Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.
Ezekiel|23|22|Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:
Ezekiel|23|23|the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, {and} all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.
Ezekiel|23|24|And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment unto them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
Ezekiel|23|25|And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy residue shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
Ezekiel|23|26|They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
Ezekiel|23|27|Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom {brought} from the land of Egypt; so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
Ezekiel|23|28|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated;
Ezekiel|23|29|and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|23|30|These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols.
Ezekiel|23|31|Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.
Ezekiel|23|32|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
Ezekiel|23|33|Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
Ezekiel|23|34|Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|23|35|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
Ezekiel|23|36|Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations.
Ezekiel|23|37|For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through {the fire} unto them to be devoured.
Ezekiel|23|38|Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
Ezekiel|23|39|For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
Ezekiel|23|40|And furthermore ye have sent for men that come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, they came; for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,
Ezekiel|23|41|and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil.
Ezekiel|23|42|And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them {twain}, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
Ezekiel|23|43|Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she {with them}.
Ezekiel|23|44|And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women.
Ezekiel|23|45|And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
Ezekiel|23|46|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.
Ezekiel|23|47|And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
Ezekiel|23|48|Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
Ezekiel|23|49|And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|24|1|Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|2|Son of man, write thee the name of the day, {even} of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.
Ezekiel|24|3|And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it:
Ezekiel|24|4|gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
Ezekiel|24|5|Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile {of wood} for the bones under {the caldron}; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.
Ezekiel|24|6|Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.
Ezekiel|24|7|For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.
Ezekiel|24|8|That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
Ezekiel|24|9|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
Ezekiel|24|10|Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.
Ezekiel|24|11|Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.
Ezekiel|24|12|She hath wearied {herself} with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust {goeth not forth} by fire.
Ezekiel|24|13|In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.
Ezekiel|24|14|I, Jehovah, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|24|15|Also the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|16|Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
Ezekiel|24|17|Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.
Ezekiel|24|18|So I spake unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
Ezekiel|24|19|And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?
Ezekiel|24|20|Then I said unto them, The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|24|21|Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
Ezekiel|24|22|And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
Ezekiel|24|23|And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
Ezekiel|24|24|Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|24|25|And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,
Ezekiel|24|26|that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?
Ezekiel|24|27|In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|25|2|Son of man, set thy face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:
Ezekiel|25|3|and say unto the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity:
Ezekiel|25|4|therefore, behold, I will deliver thee to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in thee, and make their dwellings in thee; they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
Ezekiel|25|5|And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|6|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|25|7|therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the nations; and I will cut thee off from the peoples, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|8|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the nations;
Ezekiel|25|9|therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
Ezekiel|25|10|unto the children of the east, {to go} against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations.
Ezekiel|25|11|and I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|12|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
Ezekiel|25|13|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will stretch out my hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; even unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
Ezekiel|25|14|And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|25|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity;
Ezekiel|25|16|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
Ezekiel|25|17|And I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
Ezekiel|26|1|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|26|2|Son of man, because that Tyre hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken {that was} the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste:
Ezekiel|26|3|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth its waves to come up.
Ezekiel|26|4|And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.
Ezekiel|26|5|She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
Ezekiel|26|6|And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|7|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and much people.
Ezekiel|26|8|He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field; and he shall make forts against thee, and cast up a mound against thee, and raise up the buckler against thee.
Ezekiel|26|9|And he shall set his battering engines against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
Ezekiel|26|10|By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
Ezekiel|26|11|With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword; and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.
Ezekiel|26|12|And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
Ezekiel|26|13|And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
Ezekiel|26|14|And I will make thee a bare rock; thou shalt be a place for the spreading of nets; thou shalt be built no more: for I Jehovah have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|26|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
Ezekiel|26|16|Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble every moment, and be astonished at thee.
Ezekiel|26|17|And they shall take up a lamentation over thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all that dwelt there!
Ezekiel|26|18|Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure.
Ezekiel|26|19|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee;
Ezekiel|26|20|then will I bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make thee to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living:
Ezekiel|26|21|I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt no more have any being; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|27|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|27|2|And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
Ezekiel|27|3|and say unto Tyre, O thou that dwellest at the entry of the sea, that art the merchant of the peoples unto many isles, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou, O Tyre, hast said, I am perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|27|4|Thy borders are in the heart of the seas; thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|5|They have made all thy planks of fir-trees from Senir; they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
Ezekiel|27|6|Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, from the isles of Kittim.
Ezekiel|27|7|Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning.
Ezekiel|27|8|The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy pilots.
Ezekiel|27|9|The old men of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to deal in thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|10|Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
Ezekiel|27|11|The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and valorous men were in thy towers; they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have perfected thy beauty.
Ezekiel|27|12|Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded for thy wares.
Ezekiel|27|13|Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise.

Ezekiel|27|20|Dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding.

Ezekiel|27|23|Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur {and} Chilmad, were thy traffickers.
Ezekiel|27|24|These were thy traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|25|The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.

Ezekiel|27|27|Thy riches, and thy wares, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the dealers in thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
Ezekiel|27|28|At the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake.
Ezekiel|27|29|And all that handled the oar, the mariners, {and} all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land,
Ezekiel|27|30|and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
Ezekiel|27|31|and they shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning.
Ezekiel|27|32|And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, {saying}, Who is there like Tyre, like her that is brought to silence in the midst of the sea?
Ezekiel|27|33|When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
Ezekiel|27|34|In the time that thou wast broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, thy merchandise and all thy company did fall in the midst of thee.
Ezekiel|27|35|All the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee, and their kings are horribly afraid; they are troubled in their countenance.
Ezekiel|27|36|The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee; thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.
Ezekiel|28|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|2|Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art man, and not God, though thou didst set thy heart as the heart of God;-
Ezekiel|28|3|behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that is hidden from thee;
Ezekiel|28|4|by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures;
Ezekiel|28|5|by thy great wisdom {and} by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches;-
Ezekiel|28|6|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God,
Ezekiel|28|7|therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
Ezekiel|28|8|They shall bring thee down to the pit; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain, in the heart of the seas.
Ezekiel|28|9|Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou art man, and not God, in the hand of him that woundeth thee.
Ezekiel|28|10|Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|11|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|12|Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
Ezekiel|28|13|Thou wast in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast created they were prepared.
Ezekiel|28|14|Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, {so that} thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|15|Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.
Ezekiel|28|16|By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore have I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
Ezekiel|28|17|Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I have cast thee to the ground; I have laid thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|18|By the multitude of thine iniquities, in the unrighteousness of thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; therefore have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee; it hath devoured thee, and I have turned thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
Ezekiel|28|19|All they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee: thou art become a terror, and thou shalt nevermore have any being.
Ezekiel|28|20|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|28|21|Son of man, set thy face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel|28|22|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.
Ezekiel|28|23|For I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her, with the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|24|And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are round about them, that did despite unto them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|28|25|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
Ezekiel|28|26|And they shall dwell securely therein; yea, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I have executed judgments upon all those that do them despite round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.
Ezekiel|29|1|In the tenth year, in the tenth {month}, in the twelfth {day} of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|29|2|Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;
Ezekiel|29|3|speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.
Ezekiel|29|4|And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.
Ezekiel|29|5|And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.
Ezekiel|29|6|And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|29|7|When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.
Ezekiel|29|8|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.
Ezekiel|29|9|And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;
Ezekiel|29|10|therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.
Ezekiel|29|11|No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
Ezekiel|29|12|And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|29|13|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;
Ezekiel|29|14|and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
Ezekiel|29|15|It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.
Ezekiel|29|16|And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|17|And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|29|18|Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
Ezekiel|29|19|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
Ezekiel|29|20|I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|29|21|In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|1|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|2|Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!
Ezekiel|30|3|For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
Ezekiel|30|4|And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
Ezekiel|30|5|Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
Ezekiel|30|6|Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|7|And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
Ezekiel|30|8|And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.
Ezekiel|30|9|In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.
Ezekiel|30|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
Ezekiel|30|11|He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
Ezekiel|30|12|And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|30|13|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|14|And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.
Ezekiel|30|15|And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
Ezekiel|30|16|And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis {shall have} adversaries in the day-time.
Ezekiel|30|17|The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these {cities} shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|18|At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
Ezekiel|30|19|Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|30|20|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first {month}, in the seventh {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|30|21|Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply {healing} medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
Ezekiel|30|22|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong {arm}, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
Ezekiel|30|23|And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
Ezekiel|30|24|And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
Ezekiel|30|25|And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
Ezekiel|30|26|And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|31|1|And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third {month}, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|31|2|Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
Ezekiel|31|3|Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.
Ezekiel|31|4|The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.
Ezekiel|31|5|Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot {them} forth.
Ezekiel|31|6|All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
Ezekiel|31|7|Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.
Ezekiel|31|8|The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.
Ezekiel|31|9|I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
Ezekiel|31|10|Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
Ezekiel|31|11|I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.
Ezekiel|31|12|And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
Ezekiel|31|13|Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;
Ezekiel|31|14|to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, {even} all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|31|15|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
Ezekiel|31|16|I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
Ezekiel|31|17|They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, {that} dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
Ezekiel|31|18|To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|1|And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|2|Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a monster in the seas; and thou didst break forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.
Ezekiel|32|3|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will spread out my net upon thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.
Ezekiel|32|4|And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the birds of the heavens to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
Ezekiel|32|5|And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.
Ezekiel|32|6|I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.
Ezekiel|32|7|And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
Ezekiel|32|8|All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|9|I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.
Ezekiel|32|10|Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
Ezekiel|32|11|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
Ezekiel|32|12|By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
Ezekiel|32|13|I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
Ezekiel|32|14|Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|15|When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|16|This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|17|It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth {day} of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|32|18|Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
Ezekiel|32|19|Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.
Ezekiel|32|20|They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.
Ezekiel|32|21|The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|22|Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
Ezekiel|32|23|whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|24|There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|25|They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that are slain.
Ezekiel|32|26|There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|27|And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, that are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are upon their bones; for {they were} the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
Ezekiel|32|28|But thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword.
Ezekiel|32|29|There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|30|There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.
Ezekiel|32|31|Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|32|32|For I have put his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|33|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|33|2|Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
Ezekiel|33|3|if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
Ezekiel|33|4|then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
Ezekiel|33|5|He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.
Ezekiel|33|6|But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.
Ezekiel|33|7|So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
Ezekiel|33|8|When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.
Ezekiel|33|9|Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
Ezekiel|33|10|And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?
Ezekiel|33|11|Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
Ezekiel|33|12|And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.
Ezekiel|33|13|When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.
Ezekiel|33|14|Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
Ezekiel|33|15|if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.
Ezekiel|33|16|None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
Ezekiel|33|17|Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
Ezekiel|33|18|When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.
Ezekiel|33|19|And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
Ezekiel|33|20|Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
Ezekiel|33|21|And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth {month}, in the fifth {day} of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
Ezekiel|33|22|Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening, before he that was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.
Ezekiel|33|23|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|33|24|Son of man, they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
Ezekiel|33|25|Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes unto your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?
Ezekiel|33|26|Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbor’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?
Ezekiel|33|27|Thus shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured; and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
Ezekiel|33|28|And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
Ezekiel|33|29|Then shall they know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel|33|30|And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah.
Ezekiel|33|31|And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goeth after their gain.
Ezekiel|33|32|And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not.
Ezekiel|33|33|And when this cometh to pass, (behold, it cometh,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
Ezekiel|34|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|34|2|Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?
Ezekiel|34|3|Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep.
Ezekiel|34|4|The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.
Ezekiel|34|5|And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
Ezekiel|34|6|My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek {after them}.
Ezekiel|34|7|Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|34|8|As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep;
Ezekiel|34|9|therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:
Ezekiel|34|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
Ezekiel|34|11|For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
Ezekiel|34|12|As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
Ezekiel|34|13|And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
Ezekiel|34|14|I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.
Ezekiel|34|15|I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|34|16|I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.
Ezekiel|34|17|And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.
Ezekiel|34|18|Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
Ezekiel|34|19|And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
Ezekiel|34|20|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Ezekiel|34|21|Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
Ezekiel|34|22|therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
Ezekiel|34|23|And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
Ezekiel|34|24|And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.
Ezekiel|34|25|And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
Ezekiel|34|26|And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.
Ezekiel|34|27|And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them.
Ezekiel|34|28|And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.
Ezekiel|34|29|And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.
Ezekiel|34|30|And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|34|31|And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|35|1|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|35|2|Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
Ezekiel|35|3|and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.
Ezekiel|35|4|I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|35|5|Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
Ezekiel|35|6|therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
Ezekiel|35|7|Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth.
Ezekiel|35|8|And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.
Ezekiel|35|9|I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|35|10|Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there:
Ezekiel|35|11|therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.
Ezekiel|35|12|And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
Ezekiel|35|13|And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.
Ezekiel|35|14|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.
Ezekiel|35|15|As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|1|And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|2|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;
Ezekiel|36|3|therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;
Ezekiel|36|4|therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;
Ezekiel|36|5|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, to cast it out for a prey.
Ezekiel|36|6|Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations:
Ezekiel|36|7|therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, {saying}, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.
Ezekiel|36|8|But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.
Ezekiel|36|9|For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;
Ezekiel|36|10|and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded;
Ezekiel|36|11|and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your former estate, and will do better {unto you} than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|12|Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.
Ezekiel|36|13|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou {land} art a devourer of men, and hast been a bereaver of thy nation;
Ezekiel|36|14|therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;
Ezekiel|36|15|neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|36|16|Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|36|17|Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.
Ezekiel|36|18|Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;
Ezekiel|36|19|and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.
Ezekiel|36|20|And when they came unto the nations, whither they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and are gone forth out of his land.
Ezekiel|36|21|But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, whither they went.
Ezekiel|36|22|Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not {this} for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went.
Ezekiel|36|23|And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
Ezekiel|36|24|For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
Ezekiel|36|25|And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.
Ezekiel|36|26|A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
Ezekiel|36|27|And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.
Ezekiel|36|28|And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Ezekiel|36|29|And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.
Ezekiel|36|30|And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
Ezekiel|36|31|Then shall ye remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
Ezekiel|36|32|Nor for your sake do I {this}, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
Ezekiel|36|33|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.
Ezekiel|36|34|And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.
Ezekiel|36|35|And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.
Ezekiel|36|36|Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
Ezekiel|36|37|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.
Ezekiel|36|38|As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|1|The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Ezekiel|37|2|And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
Ezekiel|37|3|And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.
Ezekiel|37|4|Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|5|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.
Ezekiel|37|6|And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|7|So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
Ezekiel|37|8|And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
Ezekiel|37|9|Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
Ezekiel|37|10|So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
Ezekiel|37|11|Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
Ezekiel|37|12|Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
Ezekiel|37|13|And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.
Ezekiel|37|14|And I will put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and ye shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, saith Jehovah.
Ezekiel|37|15|The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|37|16|And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and {for} all the house of Israel his companions:
Ezekiel|37|17|and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.
Ezekiel|37|18|And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?
Ezekiel|37|19|say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, {even} with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
Ezekiel|37|20|And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
Ezekiel|37|21|And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
Ezekiel|37|22|and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
Ezekiel|37|23|neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
Ezekiel|37|24|And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in mine ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
Ezekiel|37|25|And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
Ezekiel|37|26|Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
Ezekiel|37|27|My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Ezekiel|37|28|And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah that sanctifieth Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
Ezekiel|38|1|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Ezekiel|38|2|Son of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
Ezekiel|38|3|and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|38|4|and I will turn thee about, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
Ezekiel|38|5|Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Ezekiel|38|6|Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|7|Be thou prepared, yea, prepare thyself, thou, and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
Ezekiel|38|8|After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them.
Ezekiel|38|9|And thou shalt ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy hordes, and many peoples with thee.
Ezekiel|38|10|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device:
Ezekiel|38|11|and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
Ezekiel|38|12|to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are {now} inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.
Ezekiel|38|13|Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?
Ezekiel|38|14|Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?
Ezekiel|38|15|And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;
Ezekiel|38|16|and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
Ezekiel|38|17|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for {many} years that I would bring thee against them?
Ezekiel|38|18|And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.
Ezekiel|38|19|For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;
Ezekiel|38|20|so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
Ezekiel|38|21|And I will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains, saith the Lord Jehovah: every man’s sword shall be against his brother.
Ezekiel|38|22|And with pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him, and upon his hordes, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
Ezekiel|38|23|And I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|1|And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
Ezekiel|39|2|and I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel;
Ezekiel|39|3|and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
Ezekiel|39|4|Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
Ezekiel|39|5|Thou shalt fall upon the open field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|6|And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell securely in the isles; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|7|And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel; neither will I suffer my holy name to be profaned any more: and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
Ezekiel|39|8|Behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord Jehovah; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
Ezekiel|39|9|And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;
Ezekiel|39|10|so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|11|And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|12|And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|13|Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|14|And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
Ezekiel|39|15|And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.
Ezekiel|39|16|And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
Ezekiel|39|17|And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.
Ezekiel|39|18|Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
Ezekiel|39|19|And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
Ezekiel|39|20|And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|39|21|And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
Ezekiel|39|22|So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.
Ezekiel|39|23|And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
Ezekiel|39|24|According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I unto them; and I hid my face from them.
Ezekiel|39|25|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
Ezekiel|39|26|And they shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
Ezekiel|39|27|when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
Ezekiel|39|28|And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered them unto their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;
Ezekiel|39|29|neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|40|1|In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth {day} of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.
Ezekiel|40|2|In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.
Ezekiel|40|3|And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
Ezekiel|40|4|And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|40|5|And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
Ezekiel|40|6|Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
Ezekiel|40|7|And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and {the space} between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.
Ezekiel|40|8|He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
Ezekiel|40|9|Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.
Ezekiel|40|10|And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
Ezekiel|40|11|And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
Ezekiel|40|12|and a border before the lodges, one cubit {on this side}, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
Ezekiel|40|13|And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.
Ezekiel|40|14|He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court {reached} unto the posts, round about the gate.
Ezekiel|40|15|And {from} the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|16|And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon {each} post were palm-trees.
Ezekiel|40|17|Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.
Ezekiel|40|18|And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
Ezekiel|40|19|Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, {both} on the east and on the north.
Ezekiel|40|20|And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.
Ezekiel|40|21|And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|22|And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.
Ezekiel|40|23|And there was a gate to the inner court over against the {other} gate, {both} on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|40|24|And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.
Ezekiel|40|25|And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|26|And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
Ezekiel|40|27|And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|40|28|Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
Ezekiel|40|29|and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
Ezekiel|40|30|And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
Ezekiel|40|31|And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
Ezekiel|40|32|And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;
Ezekiel|40|33|and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
Ezekiel|40|34|And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
Ezekiel|40|35|And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured {it} according to these measures;
Ezekiel|40|36|the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|40|37|And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
Ezekiel|40|38|And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.
Ezekiel|40|39|And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.
Ezekiel|40|40|And on the {one} side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.
Ezekiel|40|41|Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew {the sacrifices}.
Ezekiel|40|42|And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.
Ezekiel|40|43|And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.
Ezekiel|40|44|And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
Ezekiel|40|45|And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;
Ezekiel|40|46|and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.
Ezekiel|40|47|And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.
Ezekiel|40|48|Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
Ezekiel|40|49|The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
Ezekiel|41|1|And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.
Ezekiel|41|2|And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
Ezekiel|41|3|Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.
Ezekiel|41|4|And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
Ezekiel|41|5|Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
Ezekiel|41|6|And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold {therein}, and not have hold in the wall of the house.
Ezekiel|41|7|And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed {the house} higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house {continued} upward; and so one went up {from} the lowest {chamber} to the highest by the middle {chamber}.
Ezekiel|41|8|I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
Ezekiel|41|9|The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.
Ezekiel|41|10|And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
Ezekiel|41|11|And the doors of the side-chambers were toward {the place} that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.
Ezekiel|41|12|And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.
Ezekiel|41|13|So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;
Ezekiel|41|14|also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|41|15|And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
Ezekiel|41|16|the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and {from} the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),
Ezekiel|41|17|to {the space} above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.
Ezekiel|41|18|And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
Ezekiel|41|19|so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. {thus was it} made through all the house round about:
Ezekiel|41|20|from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.
Ezekiel|41|21|As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance {thereof} was as the appearance {of the temple}.
Ezekiel|41|22|The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.
Ezekiel|41|23|And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
Ezekiel|41|24|And the doors had two leaves {apiece}, two turning leaves: two {leaves} for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
Ezekiel|41|25|And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.
Ezekiel|41|26|And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.
Ezekiel|42|1|Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.
Ezekiel|42|2|Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel|42|3|Over against the twenty {cubits} which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.
Ezekiel|42|4|And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits’ breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
Ezekiel|42|5|Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.
Ezekiel|42|6|For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore {the uppermost} was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
Ezekiel|42|7|And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.
Ezekiel|42|8|For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.
Ezekiel|42|9|And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.
Ezekiel|42|10|In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.
Ezekiel|42|11|And the way before them was like the appearance of {the way of} the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
Ezekiel|42|12|And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
Ezekiel|42|13|Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.
Ezekiel|42|14|When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.
Ezekiel|42|15|Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.
Ezekiel|42|16|He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel|42|17|He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
Ezekiel|42|18|He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel|42|19|He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
Ezekiel|42|20|He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.
Ezekiel|43|1|Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|2|And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.
Ezekiel|43|3|And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel|43|4|And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|5|And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
Ezekiel|43|6|And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
Ezekiel|43|7|And he said unto me, Son of man, {this is} the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings {in} their high places;
Ezekiel|43|8|in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was {but} the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
Ezekiel|43|9|Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
Ezekiel|43|10|Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
Ezekiel|43|11|And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.
Ezekiel|43|12|This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
Ezekiel|43|13|And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.
Ezekiel|43|14|And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
Ezekiel|43|15|And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
Ezekiel|43|16|And the altar hearth shall be twelve {cubits} long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.
Ezekiel|43|17|And the ledge shall be fourteen {cubits} long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.
Ezekiel|43|18|And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
Ezekiel|43|19|Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.
Ezekiel|43|20|And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Ezekiel|43|21|Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|43|22|And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.
Ezekiel|43|23|When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|24|And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezekiel|43|25|Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.
Ezekiel|43|26|Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
Ezekiel|43|27|And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|44|1|Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
Ezekiel|44|2|And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
Ezekiel|44|3|As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.
Ezekiel|44|4|Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.
Ezekiel|44|5|And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|44|6|And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,
Ezekiel|44|7|in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, {to add} unto all your abominations.
Ezekiel|44|8|And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
Ezekiel|44|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.
Ezekiel|44|10|But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|11|Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
Ezekiel|44|12|Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.
Ezekiel|44|13|And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
Ezekiel|44|14|Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
Ezekiel|44|15|But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah:
Ezekiel|44|16|they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
Ezekiel|44|17|And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
Ezekiel|44|18|They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with {anything that causeth} sweat.
Ezekiel|44|19|And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments.

Ezekiel|44|21|Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.

Ezekiel|44|23|And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.

Ezekiel|44|31|The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.
Ezekiel|45|1|Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand {reeds}, and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|2|Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred {in length} by five hundred {in breadth}, square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.
Ezekiel|45|3|And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.
Ezekiel|45|4|It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|45|5|And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, {for} twenty chambers.

Ezekiel|45|8|In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Ezekiel|45|9|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|10|Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.

Ezekiel|45|12|And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

Ezekiel|45|14|and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, {which is} ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)
Ezekiel|45|15|and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|45|16|All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.
Ezekiel|45|17|And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
Ezekiel|45|18|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.
Ezekiel|45|19|And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
Ezekiel|45|20|And so thou shalt do on the seventh {day} of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.
Ezekiel|45|21|In the first {month}, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.

Ezekiel|45|24|And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|45|25|In the seventh {month}, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil.
Ezekiel|46|1|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
Ezekiel|46|2|And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
Ezekiel|46|3|And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.
Ezekiel|46|4|And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;
Ezekiel|46|5|and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|6|And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:
Ezekiel|46|7|and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|8|And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.
Ezekiel|46|9|But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.
Ezekiel|46|10|And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth {together}.
Ezekiel|46|11|And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
Ezekiel|46|12|And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
Ezekiel|46|13|And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.
Ezekiel|46|14|And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.
Ezekiel|46|15|Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.
Ezekiel|46|16|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
Ezekiel|46|17|But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.
Ezekiel|46|18|Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
Ezekiel|46|19|Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
Ezekiel|46|20|And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, {and} where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
Ezekiel|46|21|Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.
Ezekiel|46|22|In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty {cubits} long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.
Ezekiel|46|23|And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.
Ezekiel|46|24|Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
Ezekiel|47|1|And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.
Ezekiel|47|2|Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of {the gate} that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
Ezekiel|47|3|When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
Ezekiel|47|4|Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through {the waters}, waters that were to the loins.
Ezekiel|47|5|Afterward he measured a thousand; {and it was} a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
Ezekiel|47|6|And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen {this}? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
Ezekiel|47|7|Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
Ezekiel|47|8|Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea {shall the waters go} which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.
Ezekiel|47|9|And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and {the waters of the sea} shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh.
Ezekiel|47|10|And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
Ezekiel|47|11|But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
Ezekiel|47|12|And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.
Ezekiel|47|13|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph {shall have two} portions.
Ezekiel|47|14|And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
Ezekiel|47|15|And this shall be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad;
Ezekiel|47|16|Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.
Ezekiel|47|17|And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
Ezekiel|47|18|And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the {north} border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side.
Ezekiel|47|19|And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook {of Egypt}, unto the great sea. This is the south side southward.
Ezekiel|47|20|And the west side shall be the great sea, from the {south} border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.
Ezekiel|47|21|So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel|47|22|And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
Ezekiel|47|23|And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|48|1|Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east {and} west,) Dan, one {portion}.
Ezekiel|48|2|And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, Asher, one {portion}.
Ezekiel|48|3|And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, Naphtali, one {portion}.

Ezekiel|48|7|And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, Judah, one {portion}.
Ezekiel|48|8|And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the oblation which ye shall offer, five and twenty thousand {reeds} in breadth, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
Ezekiel|48|9|The oblation that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand {reeds} in length, and ten thousand in breadth.
Ezekiel|48|10|And for these, even for the priests, shall be the holy oblation: toward the north five and twenty thousand {in length}, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|48|11|{It shall be} for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
Ezekiel|48|12|And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
Ezekiel|48|13|And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
Ezekiel|48|14|And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy unto Jehovah.
Ezekiel|48|15|And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|48|16|And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
Ezekiel|48|17|And the city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
Ezekiel|48|18|And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labor in the city.
Ezekiel|48|19|And they that labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.
Ezekiel|48|20|All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city.
Ezekiel|48|21|And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
Ezekiel|48|22|Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince’s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince.
Ezekiel|48|23|And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin, one {portion}.
Ezekiel|48|24|And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon, one {portion}.
Ezekiel|48|25|And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar, one {portion}.

Ezekiel|48|28|And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of Meribath-kadesh, to the brook {of Egypt}, unto the great sea.
Ezekiel|48|29|This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions, saith the Lord Jehovah.
Ezekiel|48|30|And these are the egresses of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred {reeds} by measure;
Ezekiel|48|31|and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.
Ezekiel|48|32|And at the east side four thousand and five hundred {reeds}, and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one.
Ezekiel|48|33|And at the south side four thousand and five hundred {reeds} by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.
Ezekiel|48|34|At the west side four thousand and five hundred {reeds}, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.

1 Chronicles|10|2|And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1 Chronicles|10|3|And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.
1 Chronicles|10|4|Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
1 Chronicles|10|5|And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword, and died.
1 Chronicles|10|6|So Saul died, and his three sons; and all his house died together.
1 Chronicles|10|7|And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1 Chronicles|10|8|And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1 Chronicles|10|9|And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
1 Chronicles|10|10|And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
1 Chronicles|10|11|And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Chronicles|10|12|all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1 Chronicles|10|13|So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Jehovah, because of the word of Jehovah, which he kept not; and also for that he asked counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire {thereby},
1 Chronicles|10|14|and inquired not of Jehovah: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
1 Chronicles|11|1|Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
1 Chronicles|11|2|In times past, even when Saul was king, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and Jehovah thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over my people Israel.
1 Chronicles|11|3|So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of Jehovah by Samuel.
1 Chronicles|11|4|And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
1 Chronicles|11|5|And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
1 Chronicles|11|6|And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.
1 Chronicles|11|7|And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David.
1 Chronicles|11|8|And he built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
1 Chronicles|11|9|And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah of hosts was with him.
1 Chronicles|11|10|Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
1 Chronicles|11|11|And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them at one time.
1 Chronicles|11|12|And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles|11|13|He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
1 Chronicles|11|14|And they stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and Jehovah saved them by a great victory.
1 Chronicles|11|15|And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles|11|16|And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
1 Chronicles|11|17|And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
1 Chronicles|11|18|And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto Jehovah,
1 Chronicles|11|19|and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with {the jeopardy of} their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles|11|20|And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three.
1 Chronicles|11|21|Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: howbeit he attained not to the {first} three.
1 Chronicles|11|22|Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he slew the two {sons of} Ariel of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
1 Chronicles|11|23|And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
1 Chronicles|11|24|These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
1 Chronicles|11|25|Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three: and David set him over his guard.
