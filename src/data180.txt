Mark|1|38|And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.
Mark|1|39|And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
Mark|1|40|And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
Mark|1|41|And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.
Mark|1|42|And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
Mark|1|43|And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,
Mark|1|44|and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
Mark|1|45|But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
Mark|2|1|And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was noised that he was in the house.
Mark|2|2|And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room {for them}, no, not even about the door: and he spake the word unto them.
Mark|2|3|And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four.
Mark|2|4|And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay.
Mark|2|5|And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins are forgiven.
Mark|2|6|But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark|2|7|Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth: who can forgive sins but one, {even} God?
Mark|2|8|And straightway Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, saith unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
Mark|2|9|Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?
Mark|2|10|But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy),
Mark|2|11|I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.
Mark|2|12|And he arose, and straightway took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
Mark|2|13|And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
Mark|2|14|And as he passed by, he saw Levi the {son} of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
Mark|2|15|And it came to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
Mark|2|16|And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, {How is it} that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
Mark|2|17|And when Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
Mark|2|18|And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say unto him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
Mark|2|19|And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
Mark|2|20|But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.
Mark|2|21|No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and a worse rent is made.
Mark|2|22|And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins: but {they put} new wine into fresh wine-skins.
Mark|2|23|And it came to pass, that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.
Mark|2|24|And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
Mark|2|25|And he said unto them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they that were with him?
Mark|2|26|How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests, and gave also to them that were with him?
Mark|2|27|And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Mark|2|28|so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.
Mark|3|1|And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
Mark|3|2|And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
Mark|3|3|And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.
Mark|3|4|And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
Mark|3|5|And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
Mark|3|6|And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
Mark|3|7|And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea,
Mark|3|8|and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.
Mark|3|9|And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:
Mark|3|10|for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
Mark|3|11|And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
Mark|3|12|And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
Mark|3|13|And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.
Mark|3|14|And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
Mark|3|15|and to have authority to cast out demons:
Mark|3|16|and Simon he surnamed Peter;
Mark|3|17|and James the {son} of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
Mark|3|18|and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the {son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
Mark|3|19|and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house.
Mark|3|20|And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
Mark|3|21|And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
Mark|3|22|And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons.
Mark|3|23|And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark|3|24|And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
Mark|3|25|And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
Mark|3|26|And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
Mark|3|27|But no one can enter into the house of the strong {man}, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong {man}; and then he will spoil his house.
Mark|3|28|Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:
Mark|3|29|but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:
Mark|3|30|because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
Mark|3|31|And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.
Mark|3|32|And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
Mark|3|33|And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?
Mark|3|34|And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!
Mark|3|35|For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Mark|4|1|And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.
Mark|4|2|And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,
Mark|4|3|Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:
Mark|4|4|and it came to pass, as he sowed, some {seed} fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.
Mark|4|5|And other fell on the rocky {ground}, where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:
Mark|4|6|and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
Mark|4|7|And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark|4|8|And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|9|And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|10|And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.
Mark|4|11|And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:
Mark|4|12|that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.
Mark|4|13|And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?
Mark|4|14|The sower soweth the word.
Mark|4|15|And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.
Mark|4|16|And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky {places}, who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;
Mark|4|17|and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.
Mark|4|18|And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,
Mark|4|19|and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
Mark|4|20|And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
Mark|4|21|And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, {and} not to be put on the stand?
Mark|4|22|For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was {anything} made secret, but that it should come to light.
Mark|4|23|If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|24|And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.
Mark|4|25|For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
Mark|4|26|And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
Mark|4|27|and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.
Mark|4|28|The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
Mark|4|29|But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.
