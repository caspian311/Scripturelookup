Romans|13|14|But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to {fulfil} the lusts {thereof}.
Romans|14|1|But him that is weak in faith receive ye, {yet} not for decision of scruples.
Romans|14|2|One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.
Romans|14|3|Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Romans|14|4|Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.
Romans|14|5|One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day {alike}. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
Romans|14|6|He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
Romans|14|7|For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.
Romans|14|8|For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
Romans|14|9|For to this end Christ died and lived {again}, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
Romans|14|10|But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
Romans|14|11|For it is written,             As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow,                   And every tongue shall confess to God.
Romans|14|12|So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Romans|14|13|Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.
Romans|14|14|I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Romans|14|15|For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.
Romans|14|16|Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
Romans|14|17|for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans|14|18|For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.
Romans|14|19|So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.
Romans|14|20|Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
Romans|14|21|It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor {to do anything} whereby thy brother stumbleth.
Romans|14|22|The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.
Romans|14|23|But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because {he eateth} not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
Romans|15|1|Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Romans|15|2|Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.
Romans|15|3|For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
Romans|15|4|For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
Romans|15|5|Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:
Romans|15|6|that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|15|7|Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.
Romans|15|8|For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises {given} unto the fathers,
Romans|15|9|and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written,             Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles,                   And sing unto thy name.
Romans|15|10|And again he saith,             Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
Romans|15|11|And again,             Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles;                   And let all the peoples praise him.
Romans|15|12|And again, Isaiah saith,             There shall be the root of Jesse,                   And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles;                   On him shall the Gentiles hope.
Romans|15|13|Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|14|And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Romans|15|15|But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,
Romans|15|16|that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|17|I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.
Romans|15|18|For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
Romans|15|19|in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;
Romans|15|20|yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was {already} named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;
Romans|15|21|but, as it is written,             They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came,                   And they who have not heard shall understand.
Romans|15|22|Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:
Romans|15|23|but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,
Romans|15|24|whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--
Romans|15|25|but now, I {say}, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.
Romans|15|26|For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.
Romans|15|27|Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it {to them} also to minister unto them in carnal things.
Romans|15|28|When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.
Romans|15|29|And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.
Romans|15|30|Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;
Romans|15|31|that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and {that} my ministration which {I have} for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;
Romans|15|32|that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.
Romans|15|33|Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans|16|1|I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:
Romans|16|2|that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and of mine own self.
Romans|16|3|Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans|16|4|who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:
Romans|16|5|and {salute} the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ.
Romans|16|6|Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on you.
Romans|16|7|Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.
Romans|16|8|Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.
Romans|16|9|Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Romans|16|10|Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them that are of the {household} of Aristobulus.
Romans|16|11|Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the {household} of Narcissus, that are in the Lord.
Romans|16|12|Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, who labored much in the Lord.
Romans|16|13|Salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Romans|16|14|Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren that are with them.
Romans|16|15|Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints that are with them.
Romans|16|16|Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.
Romans|16|17|Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.
Romans|16|18|For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.
Romans|16|19|For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil.
Romans|16|20|And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Romans|16|21|Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
Romans|16|22|I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in the Lord.
Romans|16|23|Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
Romans|16|24|{The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.}
Romans|16|25|Now to him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal,
Romans|16|26|but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith:
Romans|16|27|to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
John|1|1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John|1|2|The same was in the beginning with God.
John|1|3|All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.
John|1|4|In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John|1|5|And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
John|1|6|There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.
John|1|7|The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
John|1|8|He was not the light, but {came} that he might bear witness of the light.
John|1|9|There was the true light, {even the light} which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
John|1|10|He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
John|1|11|He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.
John|1|12|But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, {even} to them that believe on his name:
John|1|13|who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John|1|14|And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.
John|1|15|John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.
John|1|16|For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.
