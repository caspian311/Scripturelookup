Numbers|26|60|And unto Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
Numbers|26|61|And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.
Numbers|26|62|And they that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, every male from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
Numbers|26|63|These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
Numbers|26|64|But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers|26|65|For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
Numbers|27|1|Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
Numbers|27|2|And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying,
Numbers|27|3|Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.
Numbers|27|4|Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.
Numbers|27|5|And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.
Numbers|27|6|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|27|7|The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
Numbers|27|8|And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
Numbers|27|9|And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
Numbers|27|10|And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
Numbers|27|11|And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute {and} ordinance, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Numbers|27|12|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
Numbers|27|13|And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered;
Numbers|27|14|because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
Numbers|27|15|And Moses spake unto Jehovah, saying,
Numbers|27|16|Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
Numbers|27|17|who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
Numbers|27|18|And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;
Numbers|27|19|and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
Numbers|27|20|And thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.
Numbers|27|21|And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
Numbers|27|22|And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
Numbers|27|23|and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as Jehovah spake by Moses.
Numbers|28|1|And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Numbers|28|2|Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
Numbers|28|3|And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|4|The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
Numbers|28|5|and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.
Numbers|28|6|It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|7|And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|8|And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|9|And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:
Numbers|28|10|this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|11|And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;
Numbers|28|12|and three tenth parts {of an ephah} of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;
Numbers|28|13|and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|28|14|And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
Numbers|28|15|And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|16|And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovah’s passover.
Numbers|28|17|And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
Numbers|28|18|In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;
Numbers|28|19|but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;
Numbers|28|20|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;
Numbers|28|21|a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
Numbers|28|22|and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
Numbers|28|23|Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.
Numbers|28|24|After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.
Numbers|28|25|And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Numbers|28|26|Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your {feast of} weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;
Numbers|28|27|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;
Numbers|28|28|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,
Numbers|28|29|a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;

Numbers|28|31|Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink-offerings.
Numbers|29|1|And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you.

Numbers|29|6|besides the burnt-offering of the new moon, and the meal-offering thereof, and the continual burnt-offering and the meal-offering thereof, and their drink-offerings, according unto their ordinance, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Numbers|29|7|And on the tenth day of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall do no manner of work;
Numbers|29|8|but ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah for a sweet savor: one young bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;
Numbers|29|9|and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,
