Job|36|7|He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:                   But with kings upon the throne                   He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
Job|36|8|And if they be bound in fetters,                   And be taken in the cords of afflictions;
Job|36|9|Then he showeth them their work,                   And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
Job|36|10|He openeth also their ear to instruction,                   And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
Job|36|11|If they hearken and serve {him},                   They shall spend their days in prosperity,                   And their years in pleasures.
Job|36|12|But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,                   And they shall die without knowledge.
Job|36|13|But they that are godless in heart lay up anger:                   They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
Job|36|14|They die in youth,                   And their life {perisheth} among the unclean.
Job|36|15|He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction,                   And openeth their ear in oppression.
Job|36|16|Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress                   Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;                   And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.
Job|36|17|But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked:                   Judgment and justice take hold {on thee}.
Job|36|18|For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements;                   Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
Job|36|19|Will thy cry avail, {that thou be} not in distress,                   Or all the forces of {thy} strength?
Job|36|20|Desire not the night,                   When peoples are cut off in their place.
Job|36|21|Take heed, regard not iniquity:                   For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
Job|36|22|Behold, God doeth loftily in his power:                   Who is a teacher like unto him?
Job|36|23|Who hath enjoined him his way?                   Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
Job|36|24|Remember that thou magnify his work,                   Whereof men have sung.
Job|36|25|All men have looked thereon;                   Man beholdeth it afar off.
Job|36|26|Behold, God is great, and we know him not;                   The number of his years is unsearchable.
Job|36|27|For he draweth up the drops of water,                   Which distil in rain from his vapor,
Job|36|28|Which the skies pour down                   And drop upon man abundantly.
Job|36|29|Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,                   The thunderings of his pavilion?
Job|36|30|Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;                   And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
Job|36|31|For by these he judgeth the peoples;                   He giveth food in abundance.
Job|36|32|He covereth his hands with the lightning,                   And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
Job|36|33|The noise thereof telleth concerning him,                   The cattle also concerning {the storm} that cometh up.
Job|37|1|Yea, at this my heart trembleth,                   And is moved out of its place.
Job|37|2|Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,                   And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
Job|37|3|He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,                   And his lightening unto the ends of the earth.
Job|37|4|After it a voice roareth;                   He thundereth with the voice of his majesty;                   And he restraineth not {the lightnings} when his voice is heard.
Job|37|5|God thundereth marvellously with his voice;                   Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
Job|37|6|For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth;                   Likewise to the shower of rain,                   And to the showers of his mighty rain.
Job|37|7|He sealeth up the hand of every man,                   That all men whom he hath made may know {it}.
Job|37|8|Then the beasts go into coverts,                   And remain in their dens.
Job|37|9|Out of the chamber {of the south} cometh the storm,                   And cold out of the north.
Job|37|10|By the breath of God ice is given;                   And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
Job|37|11|Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;                   He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
Job|37|12|And it is turned round about by his guidance,                   That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them                   Upon the face of the habitable world,
Job|37|13|Whether it be for correction, or for his land,                   Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
Job|37|14|Hearken unto this, O Job:                   Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
Job|37|15|Dost thou know how God layeth {his charge} upon them,                   And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
Job|37|16|Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,                   The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
Job|37|17|How thy garments are warm,                   When the earth is still by reason of the south {wind}?
Job|37|18|Canst thou with him spread out the sky,                   Which is strong as a molten mirror?
Job|37|19|Teach us what we shall say unto him;                           {For} we cannot set {our speech} in order by reason of darkness.
Job|37|20|Shall it be told him that I would speak?                   Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
Job|37|21|And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;                   But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
Job|37|22|Out of the north cometh golden splendor:                   God hath upon him terrible majesty.
Job|37|23|{Touching} the Almighty, we cannot find him out                   He is excellent in power;                   And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
Job|37|24|Men do therefore fear him:                   He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
Job|38|1|Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
Job|38|2|Who is this that darkeneth counsel                   By words without knowledge?
Job|38|3|Gird up now thy loins like a man;                   For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
Job|38|4|Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?                   Declare, if thou hast understanding.
Job|38|5|Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?                   Or who stretched the line upon it?
Job|38|6|Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?                   Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,
Job|38|7|When the morning stars sang together,                   And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Job|38|8|Or {who} shut up the sea with doors,                   When it brake forth, {as if} it had issued out of the womb;
Job|38|9|When I made clouds the garment thereof,                   And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,
Job|38|10|And marked out for it my bound,                   And set bars and doors,
Job|38|11|And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;                   And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
Job|38|12|Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days {began},                           {And} caused the dayspring to know its place;
Job|38|13|That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,                   And the wicked be shaken out of it?
Job|38|14|It is changed as clay under the seal;                   And {all things} stand forth as a garment:
Job|38|15|And from the wicked their light is withholden,                   And the high arm is broken.
Job|38|16|Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?                   Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
Job|38|17|Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?                   Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Job|38|18|Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth?                   Declare, if thou knowest it all.
Job|38|19|Where is the way to the dwelling of light?                   And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
Job|38|20|That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,                   And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?
Job|38|21|{Doubtless}, thou knowest, for thou wast then born,                   And the number of thy days is great!
Job|38|22|Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,                   Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
Job|38|23|Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,                   Against the day of battle and war?
Job|38|24|By what way is the light parted,                   Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
Job|38|25|Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood,                   Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;
Job|38|26|To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;                   On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
Job|38|27|To satisfy the waste and desolate {ground},                   And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
Job|38|28|Hath the rain a father?                   Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
Job|38|29|Out of whose womb came the ice?                   And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
Job|38|30|The waters hide themselves {and become} like stone,                   And the face of the deep is frozen.
Job|38|31|Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades,                   Or loose the bands of Orion?
Job|38|32|Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?                   Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?
Job|38|33|Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?                   Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
Job|38|34|Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,                   That abundance of waters may cover thee?
Job|38|35|Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go,                   And say unto thee, Here we are?
Job|38|36|Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?                   Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
Job|38|37|Who can number the clouds by wisdom?                   Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
Job|38|38|When the dust runneth into a mass,                   And the clods cleave fast together?
Job|38|39|Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness,                   Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
Job|38|40|When they couch in their dens,                           {And} abide in the covert to lie in wait?
Job|38|41|Who provideth for the raven his prey,                   When his young ones cry unto God,                           {And} wander for lack of food?
Job|39|1|Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?                           {Or} canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
Job|39|2|Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?                   Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
Job|39|3|They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,                   They cast out their pains.
Job|39|4|Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;                   They go forth, and return not again.
Job|39|5|Who hath sent out the wild ass free?                   Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
Job|39|6|Whose home I have made the wilderness,                   And the salt land his dwelling-place?
Job|39|7|He scorneth the tumult of the city,                   Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
Job|39|8|The range of the mountains is his pasture,                   And he searcheth after every green thing.
