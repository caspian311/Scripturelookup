Luke|22|30|that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke|22|31|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat:
Luke|22|32|but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.
Luke|22|33|And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.
Luke|22|34|And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
Luke|22|35|And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.
Luke|22|36|And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
Luke|22|37|For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.
Luke|22|38|And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
Luke|22|39|And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.
Luke|22|40|And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|41|And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed,
Luke|22|42|saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
Luke|22|43|And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
Luke|22|44|And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
Luke|22|45|And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,
Luke|22|46|and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
Luke|22|47|While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
Luke|22|48|But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
Luke|22|49|And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
Luke|22|50|And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.
Luke|22|51|But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye {them} thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Luke|22|52|And Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves?
Luke|22|53|When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
Luke|22|54|And they seized him, and led him {away}, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.
Luke|22|55|And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.
Luke|22|56|And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light {of the fire}, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.
Luke|22|57|But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.
Luke|22|58|And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art {one} of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.
Luke|22|59|And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.
Luke|22|60|But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
Luke|22|61|And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.
Luke|22|62|And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Luke|22|63|And the men that held {Jesus} mocked him, and beat him.
Luke|22|64|And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?
Luke|22|65|And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.
Luke|22|66|And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,
Luke|22|67|If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:
Luke|22|68|and if I ask {you}, ye will not answer.
Luke|22|69|But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Luke|22|70|And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
Luke|22|71|And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
Luke|23|1|And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.
Luke|23|2|And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.
Luke|23|3|And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.
Luke|23|4|And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.
Luke|23|5|But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.
Luke|23|6|But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
Luke|23|7|And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.
Luke|23|8|Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
Luke|23|9|And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
Luke|23|10|And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
Luke|23|11|And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.
Luke|23|12|And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
Luke|23|13|And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke|23|14|and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
Luke|23|15|no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.
Luke|23|16|I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
Luke|23|17|{Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.}
Luke|23|18|But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --
Luke|23|19|one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
Luke|23|20|And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;
Luke|23|21|but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
Luke|23|22|And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.
Luke|23|23|But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
Luke|23|24|And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.
Luke|23|25|And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
Luke|23|26|And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.
Luke|23|27|And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
Luke|23|28|But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
Luke|23|29|For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
Luke|23|30|Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
Luke|23|31|For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
Luke|23|32|And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
Luke|23|33|And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
Luke|23|34|And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.
Luke|23|35|And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.
Luke|23|36|And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,
Luke|23|37|and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
Luke|23|38|And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke|23|39|And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.
Luke|23|40|But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
Luke|23|41|And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
Luke|23|42|And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.
Luke|23|43|And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
Luke|23|44|And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
Luke|23|45|the sun’s light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
Luke|23|46|And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.
Luke|23|47|And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
Luke|23|48|And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.
Luke|23|49|And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
Luke|23|50|And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man
Luke|23|51|(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), {a man} of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:
Luke|23|52|this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke|23|53|And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.
Luke|23|54|And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
Luke|23|55|And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.
Luke|23|56|And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke|24|1|But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Luke|24|2|And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
