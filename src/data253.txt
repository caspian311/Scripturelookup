Ezra|1|4|And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|5|Then rose up the heads of fathers’ {houses} of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra|1|6|And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
Ezra|1|7|Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods;
Ezra|1|8|even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
Ezra|1|9|And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,
Ezra|1|10|thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
Ezra|1|11|All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
Ezra|2|1|Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;
Ezra|2|2|who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Ezra|2|43|The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,
Ezra|2|44|the children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon,
Ezra|2|45|the children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of Akkub,
Ezra|2|46|the children of Hagab, the children of Shamlai, the children of Hanan,
Ezra|2|47|the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of Reaiah,
Ezra|2|48|the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of Gazzam,
Ezra|2|49|the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of Besai,
Ezra|2|50|the children of Asnah, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephisim,
Ezra|2|51|the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,
Ezra|2|52|the children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,
Ezra|2|53|the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,
Ezra|2|54|the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
Ezra|2|55|The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Hassophereth, the children of Peruda,
Ezra|2|56|the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
Ezra|2|57|the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Ami.
Ezra|2|58|All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
Ezra|2|59|And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, {and} Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
Ezra|2|60|the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
Ezra|2|61|And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
Ezra|2|62|These sought their register {among} those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
Ezra|2|63|And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
Ezra|2|64|The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,
Ezra|2|65|besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
Ezra|2|66|Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
Ezra|2|67|their camels, four hundred thirty and five; {their} asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
Ezra|2|68|And some of the heads of fathers’ {houses}, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place:
Ezra|2|69|they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.
Ezra|2|70|So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
Ezra|3|1|And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
Ezra|3|2|Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
Ezra|3|3|And they set the altar upon its base; for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries: and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto Jehovah, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.
Ezra|3|4|And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and {offered} the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;
Ezra|3|5|and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and {the offerings} of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of Jehovah that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill-offering unto Jehovah.
Ezra|3|6|From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah: but the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not yet laid.
Ezra|3|7|They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
Ezra|3|8|Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of Jehovah.
Ezra|3|9|Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
Ezra|3|10|And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, after the order of David king of Israel.
Ezra|3|11|And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto Jehovah, {saying}, For he is good, for his lovingkindness {endureth} for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
Ezra|3|12|But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ {houses}, the old men that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
Ezra|3|13|so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
Ezra|4|1|Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto Jehovah, the God of Israel;
Ezra|4|2|then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ {houses}, and said unto them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.
Ezra|4|3|But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’ {houses} of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
Ezra|4|4|Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
Ezra|4|5|and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Ezra|4|6|And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra|4|7|And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian {character}, and set forth in the Syrian {tongue}.
Ezra|4|8|Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
Ezra|4|9|then {wrote} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,
